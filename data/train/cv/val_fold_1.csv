Fisrt, In high school all the students have diffents dream on the world. Some students dream to be a Doctor, arctecture, teacher, and nurse, ect. Is a good oportunity to have a good education and a make a good person and helpfull. Then, the students can have a better life and good jobs.

Sometimes the students in young age estared to think about what carrer is better for them. Others think what career is usefull to make a good money and have a better class social. But all the students think diferent the others and we have to respet they decicion about they future.

secondly, In my opinion is is good to think or dream in biger. In my potition my family do not have all lot of money to go to the university and pay for it. For example, some of my friends are a good Doctor and arquicteture, but the thing is when they want to be a good person a get better futures on their lifes. Usually, when we think about it , but is so dificul to do it.

Thirt, students in the school have special classes to go with a career. all the people have the oportunity to think about, which want to study and where they go too. But some students cann't go to study the career they want ,because some of them have to work and pay bill in their hause. usually some of them have everything in the house and the only thing they have to do is study and make sure they work to complite all of the school and can go to study that set.

In conclution,

is a good idea to know what you want to study in young age. Also to be responsable all the things and have a great time of the life to think what is make you happy when you grew up. One day a want to be doctor of the animals. that will be make me happy.                          ",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0

If the people will have a good posture in all position of their live, not have so much preocupation they was be more happy. when you have a big text in the school although,

you never can pass this text but you have a positive attitude, of one you console will call you, and said you pass the text. This is important because the people believe in will pass and when they pass was feel so good, because they this text was so hart, but never to surrender.

01B3FDB3FD57,"Scientist Albert Einstein once said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" Now imagine yourself as a beginning engineer, sitting at your desk, aggravated because you can't come up with a new invention. All you have around you are textbooks but no image or thought of what your invention may be. If only you could imagine a new invention of some sort then maybe you could build something. But with no imagination, how can you build knowledge? I agree with Einstein's quote. I believe imagination is more important than knowledge.

I agree with Einstein's quote because having imagination is how we've had all our inventions yet. Without imagination how were many of the things we own invented? For example, the telephone. The telephone couldn't have been invented without someone imagining a device where you could communicate without leaving your home. You need imagination in order to make new things. Another example would be the camera. Whoever invented it, had to have imagination in order to think of a device that captures any moment almost in an instant. Even I, as a student, need imagination in order to make new things. For example, when making an essay, such as this one, I need to imagine of a good story hook that goes along with the prompt.

Furthermore, I believe in Einstein quote because without imagination, knowledge is almost useless. For example, when learning a new vocabulary list. You may know all the definitions but you can't put them in your own words or use the words in different instances. Why? Because you can't imagine it. You can't picture it, you just know the definitions. Another example is when reading a book. Knowing how to read isn't even near of what you need to fully comprehend a book. You need to imagine it. Picture the story in your mind in order to fully understand the book's theme, setting and tone.

Lastly, I agree in Einstein's quote because without imagination, all our decisions would be made carelessly. For instance, before you speak or move, most of the time you imagine what the outcome of that action will be. If not, the outcome won't be for the better. Another instance is when in an experiment, you hypothesize what the result of the experiment will be. That takes imagination. When signing a contract, it's needed to imagine the consequences of signing and not signing the contract. In other words, you need to imagine things before you decide to take them on. Knowledge isn't the only thing that will help you when making decisions.

In conclusion, Einstein's quote is correct in my perspective. Knowledge isn't the most important factor to have, imagination is key to everything you do and will do. You can't fully understand most things without imagining them. Can't go on inventing things before imagining them first. Also, you won't be able to make good decisions before imagining the outcome. All in all, imagination is also how you'll enjoy your life. Knowledge is great and all but it can't bring others as much happiness as imagination can. It's how we've been happy for all these years. Imagination is how we have gone so far in this world and how much we've survived.                 ",4.0,4.5,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.5
0230A077F5B6,"some school districts offer programs that allow high school student to graduate in three years insted of the tradional four years. I believe that high school student should not allow to graduate in three years. Beacuse for example they are not going to have free time with friends, it's hard for student who learnd new language and some student work afther school. Did you imagen yours child spend all day at school studying hard out seem their parents most of the day just want tham graduate in less then four years.

To begin with, all single child or student need to have free time play with the friends the student don't have to worry about stay afther school to study. most student like afther school go to thier friends houses to play video game, go to eat restaurent also student who graduate in four years don't have to be take any clases during summer or evenings. they can have time to play any sport they like during summer insted of be in at school taking any clases.

In addition for those student who are learning a new language three years is not enought time to learnd every single studnet differnt time to learn some of than learn faster than others student this program that offer that allow high school student graduate in three years,may have to know that each student laern differenly. Anothers disavanges to graduate in three years insted of four is that student don't have time to secand chances to take any felling sol or test they must have to pass each test or sol each years to able to graduate. I feel that is too much prechers for student who learning a new language that they don't have enought time to learn better, that can effect the student when they want to attend to go to callage. It's song that one years can't make any different but,for must of student will be make different,in one years we can prepere student whow callage are what is the different bitween high school classes and callage classes.

The least but list as we know some student work afther school the issue is that this student don't have time to do their homework and study for any test some tham student work fourty hours per week they are going to sleep late night it's hard to attend to school everyday and work at the same time. they just not focus in school they have anothers responsability for example, help their family pay bill or rent so,this student may take the four years to graduate from high school they can do some make up some work and study.

Inconclusion In my opinon the student from high school should not allow to graduate in three years we can keep traditional four years. in this case the student can have more time to play with the friends, time to learn better a new language learn more in high school to be ready for callage and they can have time to help their family with anything this programs should help the student to keep traditional four years the student are future any country may have suppor with are better for them.

025722D0AFB7,"Now a days most employers are looking for specific characteristics in potential employees'. They look for someone who is responsible, hard-working, humble, and kind. Someone who is going to be a role modle for the company, and also for the community. Commonly, they look for a person who has experience, specially with costumer service. When the company decides to hire someone with all of these characteristics, the company is going to increase its sales, more costumers are going to visit the location, and they are going to be happy with the service provided.

I belive that by having a good behavior and showing our values and manners, we are representing our families, and who we really are. Manners and values play a big role when hiring an employee. When communicating with costumers there has to be mutual respect. Responsability is also really important. Showing up to work on time, with a clean uniform and a possitive attitude, is a way to show responsability and respect to the company. Therefore, by working hard and staying true to your self we are going to help make work a better place.

A role model is kind, humble, learns from its mistakes every day, as well as to be a better person at work and outside from work. An employee is a role model for the community, and also it represents the company.

As we all know, work can be hard sometimes, so it is important to ask for help when needed. By doing this we are creating a comfortable atmosphere for costumers to feel like home and to feel welcome. Eventually, sales are going to increase and the company is going to make more money.

Most teenagers my age don't have that much experience in any jobs. Mostly because they're too young, and the jobs they apply for recures at leas 1 or 2 years of experience. However, I think that at least we should get an opportunity to get the job, because no one would ever know how good we can be if we don't get an opportunity. In my past experience, I've worked before with as a cashier. I'm also respectful and responsible. I take my job really serous and I don't like to play games. I'm a straight forward person, who belives that if employees are good to the costumers, more and more people will visit the location and the bussines will show more growth.

I highly belive that I am a good candidate for this position. For me it is really important to have manners and values, specially inside work. To treat people with kindness and respectfuly. Also to be responsible, and something that is really important for me is to work hard to get what i want. When i go to a restaurant or to a store, I like to feel welcomed, so that why I treat costumers the way how i like to be treated. In advance, i will like to say the importance of being a role model for our generation, We are the future of this world and we have to make good decitions every day.

0369AD4B5726,"I would agree with being honest at all times because if I'am honest, I'am telling the truth and I'm not lying towards anyone. The reason why being honest is the best policy is that people can really trust me if they ask me a question or if I need their help with any of my work even if they are not honest or completely honest with any of their work. I think that honesty would be number one in my personality because people get smarter when they grow and honesty will be in my life mostly from the start. Another reason why honesty is very important in my life would be to believe that I'm not going to fail a test or I won't get bullied in the future. But sometimes honesty would fail and some people are going to get angry with me when they actually trusted me. Then they might have learned a lesson to not trust me in their entire life ever again. That would be sad if I said I were honest that this would happen and I was actually positive about it just to make my friend or my family member happy instead of thinking about all the negative things that are going to happen which actually might have a tiny chance to happen or not happen. After a negative relationship about honesty happens with my friend or family member, they would disagree on my honesty and might never trust me again and find someone smarter than me. Later in my life, my friend or family member might apologize to me when they could not trust me in the past. The relationship with my family member or friend might come back together again and they might agree with my honesty once again and we might never get into a fight about honesty and relationships ever again. But what if my friend or family member found more than one person besides me to trust in their honesty. We might have a huge debate going on about that and also get into a fight that would never stop. It would be best to not have a huge argument about honesty and I can meet with the other person face to face and have a conversation with them which is not that harmful and nobody will hurt anyone's feelings or my friend or family member would not allow me to be with them their entire life anymore. That would be better because it would be best to gather as many people as I know because then me and other people who are very good with honesty can help my friends and my family members stop thinking about negative relationships and we can make them think about positive relationships so they won't get stressed out or they won't have any attacks when they think about anything that makes them feel sad or other dangerous thoughts like suicidal thoughts, dying by doing drugs, getting into a car crash etc. Even if someone tells me that they cannot trust me and they disagree with my honesty, I don't have any dangerous thoughts about death. I will fight back for my position in honesty even if many people trusted my honesty and I failed them in my honesty. Still, my honesty is not a failure. I will be honest my entire life and I will never lose my most important personality about me which is honesty. If I think I'm going to fail a test on the first attempt. I'm always honest that I will not fail this test today and I'm going to try so hard on this test that I pass and I will win and be happy with my own honesty that I trust. Sometimes if I forget to study for a test, it's not honesty's fault I failed. It's my fault I did not study for the test because most of the answers I got wrong in the test is because I guessed instead of knowing the correct answer. If I can't trust honesty or if I don't need it now. I'll use my honesty if I really need it help me succeed so I won't be a failure in life. I would want everyone to have honesty as their number one personality because honesty can really help everyone solve many conflicts that are not easy to solve in one attempt and I might need help with it. Most people disagree with being honest at all times and they say it's not their number one personality because people first have to learn the true meaning of honesty and how it can actually help me succeed in your life. Most of the time, people think that very smart people have the best honesty and they might agree with their honesty for some reason. But they're wrong, I can trust everyone's honesty. It's not like people who are not smart don't have the best honesty and people who are smart have the best honesty, they're equal. People who are not that smart can grow in the future and their honesty can lead to many people supporting someone who was not smart in the past and is now smart in the future. Same with smart people, they can either continue to grow or their smartness has a tiny chance of dropping. Then people in the future for some reason would continue to trust smart people even if I know that their smartness and their true honesty has dropped which would mean that they started to lie in the future and in the past they would tell the truth. That would be the reason why smart people in the past might start to lie about most of their things in the future if nobody teaches them to never get into the non honesty mode. The right people that can reteach me about honesty if you lose it would be either your family members or teachers because you don't goof around with my family and my teachers that often, it's mainly with my friends because they can try to get me into a different world to forget about honesty and everyone will wonder what happened with being honest and why can't they trust me anymore. Same with people who grow, my friends and family members will be suprised how I learned to be honest and how most people can trust me now. They would be put in a totally different world and they would be thinking. ""How did they change in the future?"" ""I thought they would still be the same their entire life?"" Finally, once they figured out how I changed in the future. They will probably inform everyone about the person that has changed. That is why honesty is number one for everyone lives and it's best.",2.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5
037C88B5B111,"Most of the schools in around the world that cut off hours in school, and they get a good results. Some people say that is the good idea, but some people think that a bad idea depend on their opinion. If they extending the school day two hours, to a four- day school a week, they will give students get more chances to focus what they like, time to explore and spend more time for family. Some of the countries try to improve it and they received a lot of good responds from students and parents recently. New things always have a difference opinion, and so many people could not adapt it, but one day it will bring a revolution to education.

The first thing brought the benefit for this idea is students can able to focus what they like. In the real world, Students have so much things to do. They have to start school at 7am to 2pm, it takes a long period of day and they could not practice what they like. If they can get less hours a day in school so they could practice sports, music,sciences instead of math and English. There must have some students interesting at classes in school and they enjoy it, but they are still force to take classes that they do not like, its not their advantages. Some students would quit school because they could not find out themselves in there, and it will costs a lot of problems into the future especially effects to the next generation. That why schools should give students more hour to get what they like to do.

The problem related to previous the first thing is time for family. Still, students spent all day long in school, and some of them want to do their favorite things after school, then they accidentally forget spend time with their family. ''Family is the root behind success of student'', but when they get home, they have to do their homework at midnight. So many tradition families that have a rule that student have to follow then they do not have time to do their homework. Some of students have a jobs after school to get more benefits, scholarships, to prepare their life in college. Some students just want to support their family and do not have time to think about school. they have to bring their homework everywhere they go. If schools follow a four-day school week, it would be better to students and their family; they can get more time to hangout; they do not need worry about school or test tomorrow. Students can enjoy their time with family.

The important thing that can not miss is time to explore. ''A fish can not claim like a monkey'', some people good at math, some at music or art and we can not take a person good at math to do music. That is exactly going on in school life; students can not find out what they truly want to do; they do not have creative. If school follow a four-day school week, students can receive more extra times to explore the world and life. They could discover nature that teachers can help them, reality could help students get more experiences and discover themselves what they good at. Europe countries like Holland and Ireland had tried this and they got the highest education in the world. In Europe, they do not have homework, students go to school four or five days a week but less hours. that is good thing that every schools in the world should follow.

Eventually, schools and teachers just want do the best for young generation, and they want to make a better life. Sometimes, they should flexible time and give students a chance to focus what they like, family and to explore a life. Students still able to finish their work, only 24 hours a day is not enough for them to complete everything. School, themselves and family, that is a lot of things to do in a day. ''Life is hard, do not make it harder'',

that is a good quote to say. Schools should give students more time.   ",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5

I strongly agree on what he said about us people always doing something will help us accomplish more. I will explain why i agree on what Thomas Jefferson wrote about always being doing something. Even though it sounds like it is not a good thing i will give you my point of view of why it is important to always be active.

First, one of the reason why it is important to be active doing something because you will accomplish more. For me i like to be busy because it will keep me focus,be determined, and keep me motivated. Being busy will help me finish my work or task i am doing. An example would be,i would rather be busy doing homework than just sitting around doing nothing and not being productive. You may have stress if your always busy but at the end it will always pay off.

Second, another reason i agree on why always doing something helps you accomplish more is in time managing. Because you can not always be something and always finish it. People like to time manage so they can finish the work that will keep them occupied the most first. If your always doing something that you need to do it will keep you from doing stuff that will not benefit you. It is good thing to build time for other task you need to do then to just stay focus on one and not accomplish as much.

Lastly, always doing something makes you a proactive person. Being lazy and not being a proactive person will affect you. Because you will not accomplish more than a person who is always doing something and is progressing in their own task they need to be doing. Always doing something is a good habit to have that will help you to always be successful. You will feel more proud of your self for the hard work you put in on your task for being always active on them.

In conclusion, all those reason i talked about are reason why i agree on what Thomas Jefferson wrote, About it being a good thing that if we are always doing something we accomplish more. You will never have to worry about not doing a certain task you need to do if your always active and productive. People will not worry about them forgetting to do things if they are always busy and remembering to use their time management skill to help them.  ",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5
038480498E5A,"Dear Principal,

I think that it is a great idea for you not to allow students that have a C average to participate in sports. My first reason, is because a lot of kids who have good grades such as B' s and A' s they don't get as distracted in school. Therefore, they will be focused better in their activity, and not in doing something like homework. People who have C' s, D' s , and F' s they will not be focused in the sports activity because they have to worry about doing homework and getting their grades up. Because they are responsible for having bad grades they shouldn't participate in school activities. Maybe you ask ""What if someone has the potential in playing but doesn't have the grades"". Its probably because they get to distracted, in playing sports and not doing their work. Kids who have bad grades tend to be lazy, and if we let them be on the team how can we expect to win if one of the members is not even participating. Another reason why, you should have good grades and be able to participate in activities is because it will look good when you go to college. There are more chances for you to get into a better college that you will like. And when you get a job you will get a well paying job. In conclusion, that is why I think the principal shouldn't let students who have a lower than a C average participate in school sports activities. One because they are lazy, and not well focused in school. I think it will be way better if kids who have good grades get the credit for participating in both sports and class work. These are my reasons why I think students who have B average should be involved in school activities and kids who have a C average shouldn't.      ",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5

Auther ralph waldo wrote i dont agree becuase he said that what you already masterd you will never grow i think that with the more you mastered the more you will know in life those things that you had masted are things that you want to do and get in life. you will understand more things like the more important thing like when you mastered drving one of the most important thing to master in life that is the first gole u want to master in life and when u do youy feel like you can do more thing once you have you get your drivers licens.

Or even as a kid when you mastered a video game you want to keep going keep getting challeged on each part of the game and when you finished on you buy another one and it keeps going even when you die on the video game you still try to keep going on unless you get fusterated and mad and you just give up and quit. Unless you keep trying you master the video game.

The things that i had mastered was the most importent one was driving its was hared for me just to get my permit and i guess it grow on me beacuase i want to do more in life i want to be able to help my family and do what i can for my sisters and brother and my mom. Like out of all the thing i had mastered i say that is one of the thing i want to do becuase be able to go to callege be some thing in life. so i say the more you master the more you grow and know as a person.

the reason why i think that the more you master the more you grow its becuase out of all the things that i had gone throw i realised that as im getteing older more and more chaleges that i will have to master will come my way in the future thing that i will want to master. i say this is why they make kids go to school so they can learn more things so that we can be challged and master things as we go throw school so we can see the type of person that we want to be in life so that we can face challeges thats whay i say the more things we master the more we grow so that we can learn from those thing.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5
043B9F48FDC2,"Should all the students have to take a music, a drama, or an art class. Or should it be an electives and they could be able to make their choice to take what they want.

I believe that everyone have different opinion , interest, or things they want to do. They are able to make their on decision but i don't think that it has to be required to take a class that some people aren't interested in. I am disagree with this prompt because those classes should an elective. In my opion i wouldn't take any of those classes and my reason why is because i am not going to enjoy or like the class because i am not interesting in it and there's not a required that i have to take any of those classes. I had a friend who didn't want to come to his art class. One day i asked him why don't you go to that class and he was like i don't like the class, i don't enjoy it at all and also i didn't choice it, they just put it in my schechule. i was like look you should go to the office and talk to them about it. Because you dont want to be there and also you don't even come to that class and after a few days and he went to talk to his consul about it. Less than a week he always be in his class and i was like it's your own choice to make desicion but i resolve it be cause you helped me.

But in other school i have one friend that he loves his art class and now he's taking it almost every year and he told me. Generic_Name you should take an art class because it's really cool and you do a lot of art also i enjoy it and i really like the class but i don't know what do you like but in my perpective i would take an art class every year. I told him look i am not going to take a class that i don't like because i'd rather be in a class that i like and i would enjoy it and i want to do stuff that i like and it will be my choice if i enjoy or not a class. Because look there's a lot of option and you can make a decicion and he told me "" Yeah you right"" and by it i just tell them everybody have to make their own decion but also remember that every decion have a concecuense. I asked a lot of people what would you do if they put you in a classs that you don't want to be in it?. They told me i just going to talk in the ofice so they can change it and i would love to come to that class but i also have the right to say something about if i don't like or i do like something cause we have a right to speak up.

We should be able to choice what we want to study we don't have to have a requiered to do things we could do things by our own. But there might be a thing that make people think we should have a required to take classes that we don't want but also they have to think about that we are teenager and we might have our future planed but if they don't know that they have to take some classes they don't even want to take then those type of things make people think that's why we have to take classes to prove ourself. Another things and it influence a lot that they make required to do things and students just don't want to they have to think how we feel about things and how we would react. We all know that sometimes we are not in a mood or we are in our feeling or we just don't feel the day at all and it can affect our decion and required because people who make the required they just don't care about how would you feel or anything they just chose what they want and they say what they think will be better for a lot of students but the thing they don't think about it how would react to thing like i said earlier every decion has a consecuense and it could be good or bad but we have to deal with it.

Most of the students would like to have all classes how they want and when they cannot do something they want then there's when the things starting coming out. Becuase they don't like it their behavior chnage and everything in that class. So all studesnts should be able to have the right to change things and everything in their schedule but their consul should have the right to say no to things that are not important at all and they could say you are taking this class because of this reason and you can't do it. Of course they will say something but they are taking care of their future and things they would do in life by taking any of this three classes. It might be good thing or it could be a bad thing but we just have to lisent to our students.

Everyone have a right to make their own desion about classes and others things but if there's a required we are not able to do anythig. Because we just have to respect the rules and do it without our opinion. If we are able to make a choice then our feeling and the way we would feel about classes it will be matter and we could make our decicion and we will like the thing we choose. But sometimes we just cannot make the decision and someone else would chose it for us so we just have to see the pro and con about the desicion we would make or the thing we would do without thinking. I think it shouldn't be a required to take this classes and it would be a elective class because some people wouldn't take this type of classes they are not going to enjoy it and go because they just don't like it at all and everyone have the desicion to speak up and make decision by our own.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5
04659704890C,"Having a good attitude is important if we want sucess. If you don't have good attitude in what we're doing then we can never get the things that we have to do done for for instance if I didn't have a good attitude everytime things got hard I wouldn't have done the things I did. Take for example If I would've had a bad attitude everytime something went wrong in my life I wouldn't be as happy as I am now because we all go through difficult times but how we choose to handlle it is way different.

Take famous people for example if they would've given up everytime people said horrible things to them they wouldn't Have as much money as the do now or famous as they are now. People who don't have good attitudes don't want other people to have success because they wish they had a good enough attitude to do what others are doing. If we decide to have a good attitude we can get more things done and accomplish way more then anyone else.

It's also nice to help other people with they're attitudes. By helping other people we can have way more success it's just simple if we want to accomplish more then we can help people with they're attitudes and help them get way more things done. Another example I have a friend and she didn't have a good attitude about her grades but she didn't want to work hard to improe them so I told her if she wanted to get her gades up she had to have a good attitude about them and she did the she started working harder and she improved so much.

Having a good attitude in life can help us out so much when we want to sucessced. It is important to have a positive outlook on life and not focus on the negative things. If we focus on the negative things to much we may forget to look at all the positive things in life. It's better to spend our time enjoying life instead of worrying about our problems alot. After all we only live once and if we spend our whole life being negative then we won't be happy in life. Being negative in life isn't how we want to spead out life if we focus on all the bad things in our life we will not sucessced at all.              ",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0

Its better to learn from experience from people so you dont have to do things they did and ended up bad. for example if you wanna buy a car and your friend has one and you ask him how it rides and if it runs smooth. If he doesnt like it how it runs he'll tell you so he wont do the mistake he did. Always ask someone that had the things you want and ask them how it is so you dont mess up. Always ask for advise from people with expreience because they know what their talking about. Always take the advise from people that you know and that would wants you to do good people that already been in the problem. Alwaysa trust the person thats telling you the truth about something and telling you how stufdf works. People whith experience will tell you everything how it went because it was probably the worst feelings ever. Some people that been in a bad problem tell the other person the problem so they wont do it so it wont hurt anyone else. It's good to learn from others because it gives you a chance to to really think about what you shouldn't do. Take advantage of what the people tell you what to do and what not to do because they want the best for you and they'll try their best to help you out. Listen closly to what they tell you because they been threw the thing you going threw right now. People that tell you things or adivse and there older than you always listen to what they want to say because it's important because they been alive longer and they been threw it.

06F5F6A09DC6,"More than one person's advice

Have you ever wondered or questioned yourself why do you have to ask more than one person's for advice? Yep you heard me. People from all around the world ask advice about anything. That could be video games, schools, and even Life. Obviously, there are many other things to ask advice. It's kind of asking for help, you can say. People incuding kids, teens, and even adults are asking advice that could help them in the furture, you guys even might have connections, and more than one person. More than one is better than just asking for one person's advice.

Having connections

The people you ask for advice were kids too just like you and they possibly ran into what you are stuck or struggling at right now. I recommand you to ask adults more than anyone else. That's either with struggles at school, home, family members, or even life. I almost forgot to include decisions because small decisions can eventually become big decisions. I recommand you to ask adults more than anyone else. I mean you can ask seniors but they most likely will forget everything since they were kids. The worst thing you can do is asking someone young even a 18 year old adult because you never know what happened in them. Trust and worthy friends you can ask but friends that you just say hi to once a day or even a week wouldn't be so great.

Help in the future

Advices not just help from the presents but in the future as well. According to my calculations you could use that advice over and over again. For example, let's say you didn't know where you put a comma in a sentence, therefore, you used a person's advice and it was to put a and where ever you were going to put the comma at. You can also use it to help your kids and even grandsons if you still remember.

More than one person's advice

Last but not least, why more than one person's advice you ask. One advice can help and even solve whatever you have in mind but you actually want to check if they were right. You probably want to gather the information and rethink it. Everyone in my opinion should at most ask two people for advice just to make sure. First person person wasn't being that specific enough so you decide to go to another person. If they haven't been specific enough then just go to another person. I mean how hard is that? Especially kids since they have just started growing up and will soon become young adults.

Everybody should be struggling something in a certain time of life that they ask for advice. Don't be shy for asking advice and you believe in yourself that you are a brave and confedent man that doesn't need help. Because really you will be a better one for asking advice. Therefore, the reason that we ask advice is to become someone better each day by taking that advice.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5

students who plans to take online classes from home they would have to learn to be more responsible and dedicated. Could students benefit by taking online classes from home,

Yes I think it would be fantastic idea taking classes from home, it would be a great way to learn without having to leave your house or worrying you wont get to school on time. Home school can get you more prepare by learning and working on time managment,by woking on time managment prepares you for future jobs. For example I have friend that does home schooling she tried going to a regular school but didnt feel comfortable her parents decided to try home schooling, she ended up loving it,she had more time do other activities, its a great idea because you could prevent bullying from happening.

Imagen not having to leaving youre home, students would have more energy because they wouldn't be as exausted. Cerain students have walk miles not matter the bad weather. If students take online classes they could get more sleep and finish there work faster. students would be able to concentrate. In school you get distracted a lot because you have friends next to you trying to talk or make caos also interupting the class.

Not having energy for school is a big factor specially for student who work and walk to school in the mornings.

if student dont have the enery to go to school learn they would not be able to get good grades. a clear example is myself having to wake up every morning at seven am and walking thirty min to school and also working every day is exausting not matter the weather. Its really hard trying to stay awake in the mornings after walking a certain distance. Thats why i would prefer online studying as well it would change my life completely and i would feel more ready to do work.

in conclusion online classes is a great way to study if you dont feel comfortable going to school.

Kids like to hang out with there friends and talk when they do activity's they will not be able to talk to each other and hang out is like resting because they are not going to run and do stuff they like having fun talking to each other. resting is a good thing for kids because they need energy for other stuff.

092BBD374359,"""Hey I had fun reading this book with you"" , younger student said. Kids especially younger ones love the older students because they make everything cool and fun. Since some schools have a program where they pair up a younger and older student together to help both of them. The program could help both of them learn something cool, interesting and the older ones can learn how to assist a kid and could share different opinion that they can't share front of the teacher about learning.

One way the program can help both younger and older student is by. They both can learn about something they have never learned or what they young want to learn about. Younger kids can teach the older ones how to say different stuff that they are learning. The older can each them what they are learning in class. This could be a mini deal that both have with each other and it could help.

Another way the program can help both younger and older student is by. The older ones are almost ready for job. He could learn more about how to control a kid and teach them or assist them. The younger kid could tell them ways and teach them. This could lead to a good bounding with older students. I think they would see each other after years and be like I know who you are you were the one who assisted me.

Last way the program can help both younger and older student is by. The feeling a student has is like why are we doing this. Is this even related to anything. They would able to give there opinion what they think about the topic or subject. Mostly students are shy front of class, but that would be only person to person, they won't be shy. This could help the students explain there self. I think it would make both of them feel comfortable.

I think this program would help alot of the students confident to talk to people and learn in a fun way. This help alot of people I

am one of them. When I was in 6th grade I was a reading, so I read books with my reading buddies it was fun. You get help in subject you need help in it makes everything easy. This program could help you in different problems you have. It will incourage you to learn more, so you can tell your helper.  ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0

I disagree because some, kids don't get enough sleep. some kids stay up, late because of electronics, helping someone, or watching TV. some kids have to help their parents, do some work like farmers or cooking. some kids lose, track of time like me.

Some kids have afternoon activities. Some kids are tired of school but if they make, it longer kids would be even more tired. It would give, students less time to take breaks at home. Grades would get worst because, the students get less time to take a break.

Some kids would get home really late. the school buses sometimes, take an hour to drop of a kid but if they add an hour and a half those, kids would get home peaty late. some kids won't have enough time to do their homework, because they are going to get home late. Some kids would not have time to do stuff because after getting of the bus late some, kids have to help around the house or their parents when they get back.

Some kids will not have a lot of time to see parents of friends. Some kids get out late because of bus or after school activities and they will not, have a lot of time left. Some kids will bot have a lot of time to get out, because of school and they will need to do their homework.

09ADB0629CD0,"Benefits of attending public schools

Imagine a child or student taking classes at home. How would his or her parents feel?

Would home school be helpful for their child? Is homeschooling important for thier child than public schools? Students would benefit to attend classes in school rather than attending class at home because students can become active, getting enough information, and having the ability to share ideas.

Attending public schools can persuade students to become active. Teachers can also persuade students to become active as well. Teachers wants students to have fun. For an example, physical education, or for short PE. It is a program in school for children to have exercise and training. Teachers would allow students to play inside or outside. Even if students do not want to participate.

Not only schools let students become active in class, but also offers information to students who need help. Getting information can help students to become better at understanding things that students learned in school. It is important to know why students want to learn. For an example, students staying after school for help. Staying after school can help students study for a test. If a student needs help or needs more information, do not be afraid to ask for help. A teacher will be there to help you. Teachers can give their best to answer student's questions.

Not only schools can persuade students to become active and offers information to students, but also shares ideas. Sharing ideas can help students as well. Students can share their ideas other students. For an example, completing assignments in a group. Students love being with partners or group to solve problems. Students would listen to others student's opinion or debate and see if they agree or disagree. It is always helpful to be with a group and not be alone by yourself.

In public schools, students can become active, can get information that they need, and let students share their ideas. That is why it is important for children to go to school. Home schools are different than public schools. Home schools can be very challenging for some students. A student working alone with no partner, not being active, and not getting enough information from parents. Imagine a student being in that position. How would she or he feel? Public schools would be the best option for children. Imagine if every student went to school, their would be a positive change in their future. School can build student's knowledge everyday and to do it is by learning. ",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0

I never hangout by myself at that hour unless im with my parents or at a family party, there is no point to be out late at night but many people dont care and be out late at night many teenagers dont obey the laws.

Its important to have curfews, it keeps teenager from being out at night. In the weekend teenagers may hangout late with a friend or cousin but it really depends on how strict the parent is. I have really strict parents they won't let me out at night, unless, they are with me. its important to make new laws to protect the envionment and the teenagers as well teenagers now a days think they can do whatever they want. 10pm is kind of late its close to midnight maybe during the weekends teenagers could hang out after midnight but during the weekdays after 10pm would be against the laws it really depends what they are doing like are they driving in a car or walking its scary to be out at night by yourself.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0

Many people think that, behind of every success is your hard wroking, and also achievment without hardworking is impossible. In my opinion inactive people are not have a good future. So they should always do something new to be able to accomplish because, to have a bright future, always successful in our life and being a good personality in our community.

Every people wants to have their best future and wants to have their best life, all of these things comes by how you put yourself in a hard time. It is obvious that without nothing anything we not gonna accomplish. Accomplishment is always comes by how hard work you do. Inactive person do not have a bright future. Inactivity makes people tired of their life because they dont have any plan for their future, they just live for no idea, with no hopes. So it is better to think about our future and build our future from now.

Being successful in our life is what everyone want. Every body want they way to find they key of success. But the person who get successed, they actually did accomplish new things. They things that makes our future bright and that we can have a good life and carrer is to work hard, focus on one main thing that make our carrier and believe in ourselves which has the important view in our life. Being inactive person is really useless in our community. We cannot be anything in our future if we be inactive.

Obviously everybody choose to have a good personality in their community. Having a good personality makes everyones to proud on you. To accomplish a good personality we should makes our thoughts and education higher. Without having a main goal in our life we cannot achieve our aim. Education is the only way for success so by having a good education and carrer we have more attach with our community and we get respect from our community. Inactivity is not the way that we can accomplish more. I think inactivity does not serve a purpose it just makes your brain stop so you could not be able to accomplish.

People should always try their best to make their life easier and it is become by hard work. People who has inactive in their life they will hurt in the future. Successful people always did something before in their life so now the successful in they have a comfort future. The reason behind accomplishment is hardworking, believe in ourselves and look forward for our goal which inactive people do not believe on this.

0BF56A2681D3,"Dear, Principal I think students should do community service because we have to keep our schools clean. We should also have community service because it will help people be cleaner by picking up after them. The community service is very important because if know one picks up the trash that's in school then our school is going to look ugly. I think you should get people to pick up every day and then for the next day get another ten people and be rotating every day. Its also necessary to help out the community because we don't want to have a dirty environment for our children and younger kids. That's why I think we should have community service most people think its not important but years later it will be important because our children are going to be the ones living with a bad environment . I think we should have community service for these reasons because if we don't clean up right now no one will clean up in the future and that will hurt us because we are going to be living in a bad environment because no one wanted to clean up .

0C7D385D812A,"How should people take decisions?? thats the real question should a person follow a feeling or motion call instincts or should they make a decision by guidance by experts and the laws and authorities. Well a person should use advise really. For example lets say a business man has to make a decision about if he should invest money or not on a product thats been selling good for the last few months but in the pass they werent selling as much. so the business man has to go and get guidance with some experts because he doesnt want to make the wrong decision and make the company waste money they wont get back.

Thats why having advisers are so helpful because there suppose to help people get out of any concerns a person has. They can guide and advice you to do things right. For example when a person is in high school that person has a guidance. That person is always going to be trying to help, there gonna help decide which classes are best for a student, and there gonna look in to the student and check why a student isnt doing good and after that there gonna try to help him so he can accomplish hes goals and graduate.

Every time we take a decision over something serious we need to think about it more than once because if it is a decision like buying a house its life changing ether it can go really good or it can hurt you badly thats why its better to think about it and talk with an expert because its needed to know if that person is ready and its stable enough. For example if a person wants to buy a house theres a lot of responsibilities that come with that decision and he or she has to be ready that means theres no more playing around and settle down and he or she needs to think about it if thats what they really want.

Take decisions it always has a grade of difficulty thats sometimes not even with the best advisers can help to make a decision being one hundred percent sure that thats the right answer. Sometimes you just have to trust youre instincts because a person has knowledge about the answer to the question but he or she think about the answer to much that they get them selves confused and thanks to that they make poor choices when really you should just trust the person is right. For example when a teacher tells a student on a test trust your instincts and dont think about the answer to much is because they know that he knows the answer.

In conclusion its always better to have a person giving you advise about a question or problem, its easier to make good decisions when a person has help than when a person is alone confused and stress about a decision. But at the same time is good to trust your self and follow your instincts and not having to depend or need someones help.                                            ",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,2.5

This could be a good reason constantly to help a lot people to accomplishment dreams, goals and purpose in the life. For example make something good for people that want growing and that the families feel pround by the achievement. Other example, give to other people a reason for to going forward and cumply their dreams and purpose in the life.

Specific job, a specific job make something greatest for a lot people in this world. In this job we help to peoples that want cumply their purpose in their lifes and enjoy their accomplishment.

The school menu repeat the same food every day. For example,the students are boring that school lunch menu don't change the food for a better that the students can be satisfy. First at all,some of the students skip classes just to go to buy good food outside the school. In addition,would be great if the department that make the menus can approve for the people who work in the cafeteria to give a good food that can help student to don't sleeps during the classes and have energy when the classes start and they can put attention. Also,changing the lunch menu the student can attend to the school every day because some of the students don't come to the school because they don't like the type of food that they give. In conclusion,for benefit of the student would be a excellent reason to change the school lunch menu.

In the school lunch menu there are food that contain a lot of grease. For example,that type of food with grease can make the student get sicken. Moreover, the grease can be accumulate and affect the heart of some of the student. Also, there are more possibility the the system of the stomach be affecting,the the amount of grease that is use in the food. In other hand, the grease can make the student be obese there are many case in school there are a lot of student obese because the food that school provide contain to much grease. In conclusion,All the food that is in the school menu can cause several problems for the students.

While other argue that change the lunch menu is a good idea,but there are other argue that change the lunch menu is not a good idea because there are some student that have a favorite food from the menu and they want the menu to stay the same. Although this might be valid, there are several important idea to considered,such as,some of the student pay there food but the food is not good enough. For example,some of the student buy the food in here of the school because they to have energy to made all the classes. So, They don't eat at home because there are not a lot amount of time so they decide to came to eat to the school but there is not a good food. However,sometimes the lunch food is costly but there are time the food is not full cook. In conclusion,the student pay the food to eat because is important to be healthier.

The school don't change the food every weak and same day they have the same food. On the other hand,there are food that are not healthier for the student to consume.

For example when you were a kid you used to imagine that you were flying through the air or in space fighting aliens on Mars, imagination can come a long way from just being a kid to inventing something that can change the world. I agree with Albert Einstein's statement I do believe his statement not only because he was one of the greatest scientist in the world but because this statement is so truthful. Knowledge is a huge part of our lives we need knowledge in everyday activities in school we gain our knowledge by going to class and learning more and more lessons everyday.

Imagination is more important than knowledge, everyone can imagine things it's not whether if I have more knowledge than you or if she has more knowledge than me there is no limit when it comes to imagination. Anyone can imagine something and make it happen it's the effort you put into your imagination that makes knowledge superior to your imagination. Knowledge can only get you so far in life if you don't have a thought proccess but what you do have is knowldge how far is that going to get you whee you need to be?

Doing just one thing, they never try something new they mind be thought the in the future wouldbe use less or they just don't feel like they actully need it but if you get more experiences you will grow as a person and besed on experiences too.

For example. When you start growing u learn a lot of things that make you a better person. You know that there is a person that want to learn new things, even if he's young but you know things like that adults know that make you be a older person. In the way that you know things that persons that have you same age not , but you know that you have some other responsabilities, because based on what you know you life have to about on that things that you know or you make or that things that you learn.

For example, you go to school that is a place where you learn and where you been intul you graduate because if you know more you have more oportunities to be succecful, and i'm agree on his coment why? let told you the reason. A lot of people never try new things like if you are a teacher and after like 5 years you don't feel like to teach more. you can try to be something else that help you to grow more based on experiences because if you try more things like other jobs or try to study something else like gona be rich on experience because many people sometimes get stuck on one thing but everything in this world have a solution but to get your goals is not a easy thing you have to sacrifed many things that you love.

For example your hoobies or your family or other events, but at the end of the day you have everything you ever wish becuse you deservet and you work so hard to get it. And you start see the succes that you have. You would see that all you did to get there was correct and that make you grow because you have more experience. Nothing is inpossible. For example if you are the owner of a little restaurant and you want to your restaurant grow more, and more but you remenber that you study bussines and also you work for a restaurant and on that restaurant you were a manager, so you have the experience and if you know how spend money and you make a good marketing plan you can be succesfull and you will growing as a person and as experiences.

In addition I think he's right becuase how I been saying if you know more you have experience and you can a have better jobs and that way you growing you have oportunities more chances to be a better on your life and unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.

You dont have to sign up for these you can sign up for the yearbooks. The year books are great because if more people sign up for the yearbooks the pictures can be done faster.

The games can be at least 1 hour and more and you can celebrate when you win a game. Games dont happen offten a week but practicing can be good for you! because you get to run and do laps when your coach tells you to.

I am very honored to write to you this letter and i pray you take time from your busy schedule and read this this letter .

i hope you are doing good as i am here.

i also want to say that i am happy to be a student in your school.

first of all i take a stand on your decision of changing the school food to a very healthier one and say it a very good one.

it's a very thoughtful idea , and it's also shows that you love the school and i appreciate you for such a great idea. it's a good idea because, half of the student have allergic reaction to some food the chief's cook so they rather go hungry or have an empty stomach and if such incident still goes on, student might even pass out one day.

secondly, if we get healthier food, we will be active and our brains will be able to function well as soon as class start. However, having a good breakfast or even any good food to begin your day sometimes help the brain to work very well , and it's also help make the brain be in a very good position of working during the day.

and not only does it work for the brain, it's also consist or contain some particular minerals like carbohydrate, protein, and fat and other supplementary substance that also help for human growth and also help give energy to the human body.

lastly , changing the school food will also will make student that has never tried the school lunch will now want to try it . Moreover, some student order food and have it deliver to the school all because they do not like the school food or allergic to certain food , and if such incident keeps happening, the school food will go waste and it's will make the school loose money.

so therefore, i will end my speech by saying that it's a very good and and a nice decision for having to change the school food to a healthier one .once again i hope you take time from your busy schedule and read this letter. ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

Although some say that people should seek guidance from people that have experience about life because they have become more wise with the years, actually people should make their own decisions because you already know what you want for your life and if you fail will be for your own decision and not on somebody else.

Some say that people should seek guidance from experts that have experience about life because they have become wise with the years. Old people like my grandfather for example, he always told me that the best way to accomplish something you really want is by giving the best of us and not wait for other people to do it for you because that is not going to happen.

In reality people should make their own decisions about what to do with their lives because you already have an idea about how you really want to be or what you want for your life to be in the future. When my brother was about to finish high school he tried to get an advice from somebody about what to do with his life, but my father was always working and my mom had not experience about life because she had taken some bad decisions in life. So my brother had to follow his instincts and take a decision in his own. Now he graduated from high school and he started an academy to be a police officer one day.

Some people say that it is better to fail by taking our own decisions and not fail because of decisions that other people take for us. I still remember my aunt Generic_Name she always wanted to be a cloth designer but she did not take her own decision and now she is still working and making some more money then a cloth designer, but she is not completely happy with her job because she followed some other people ideas and she did not think on what she really wanted for her life.

In conclusion it is better to follow your ideas because that way we will do what we really want for our lives and not what other people tell you to do even if they haven more experience sometimes is just better to follow your instincts. Seek guidance from experts that have a lot of experience about life is not always the best thing to do because if you follow their ideas you will not work on what you want.

0EC392C06372,"Introduction:

Author Ralph Waldo Emerson ""Unless you try to do something, beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"". One thing that is really important in life is School because is the second place that we learn about how we can be respectful, responsible, honest and education. The second thing is Work- Independent because when we are always with our family is simple because we don't know how is the reality in the life. We were dependent but work include be prepare to have new experiences in our personal life and we are prepare to the future. The third thing is Life Cycle when we are baby, kids, teenagers, adults and older.

The first is School (experiences) In our life school is important because teachers educate we and we learn of them about the classes like english when we travel to any country that speak this language we need to learn by process every day inside and outside the class because we improve with new topics like verbs, punctuation marks in school porcess. Teachers teach good values in our life like integrity, respectful, honest, responsible, service. For example, when we start to study we don't know how to write, read, paint, speak. They teach we everything like our parents at home. We decide when we grow up if we want graduate from the school,those values efforts, dedication, knowledge, good skills and new opportunities if we do everything correct inside and outside the school because we can't stop growing the opportunites that we can have is only one time in the life.

Education is very important now in the present because if we go to school we are professionals and we can have good choices. Second is Work being independent in the life our parents work all the time because they want that we can have a good life, but when we go to work is interesting for example when we continue going to the school our parents can't give money all the time and we think like adults being independent, finding a job and learn about the life not is simple and is hard at the same time. Our future dependent if we want to think like adults or teenagers. We can be master helping other people that need our help those people will grateful with we because if we try to help each other we know everything from life experiences, when we go to school they pay better with a diploma from High School, College or University.

Finally is Life Cycle when we are babies our parents teach we every process for example how to go to the restroom, brush our tooth, take a shower, speak, walk, eat for example when is the time for go to the dinning room. The time when we need go to sleep is relly important learn every little thing that our parents teach we when we are baby. We discovere a new stair that already we can be mastered. Kids for example after when we were baby in a simple thing we discovered new things, but being kids we continue in a easy way the life like speak, walk, eat, sleep, change our clothe not is difficult because we learn in the past, we try to do something beyond that we don't know before. Teenagers when we think that the life is hard going to the school, work, family, not is easy because is more responsability, efforts being stronger and continue doing those things is very different from the past. Adults is more difficult when we were baby, kids and teenagers because adults are charge of the family, work, pay, education,

responsabilitys in the job and home. Adults are dependent because they learn the good things from the past for example when teenager want permission for go to any party adults really need to know what person is, where is from, the personality and who is her/his family,

in any moment like that is really difficult to say yes or no. Adults are important in the society because they are master and grow from the Life Cycle. Older like grandmother and father they already know that grow not is easy but they did every step in a good form going the school, work - independent. Old people in sometimes need help from younger people like the family can be sister, brother, son, wife and daughter because they are tired and need space to relax like going to the park sharing with his/her family and friends. In this last thing if we try something different we can have a positive life.

In conclusion:

We can try being a better person in our life because every step is very important maybe in sometimes life is hard but if we learn in a correctly form everything like going to the school is a new experience, work - independent teach we being stronger and not be afraid, life cycle is the process from every step when we were baby, kids, teenagers, adultd and older. We grow every moment that can be easy or difficult. We need to be dependent to grow up, master everything helping other people in the world. I agree with the author because I know if we stop growing is very impossible to have new experiences in our life. Unless we try to do something different and intersting in our life we can a better chance to do good things can be in the present or in the future, for the new generation that can have good opportunities in school, job and with the society.

0F3EC382C3CB,"The benefits of working in as a group or working alone.

I believe working as a group is more beneficial for the students.

My friend Generic_Name is very capable of doing school work by himself.

However, even he needed others help to understand somethings.

I am very capable of doing a school project by myself.

However, even I could use some one else's input in the matter.

I believe working together as a group is beneficial .

For example, my friend Generic_Name he is a very smart person.

He was on the top of the class with grades but, even he could not do it by himself.

One day the teacher assigned us projects.

Generic_Name decided to do it alone.

On the due date, which was later that week Generic_Name turned in the project.

The teacher told him he failed he did not understand why.

The teacher later on the day took him aside and explained that he was not understanding the question.

He asked her how he could make up the points for the failed project.

Two weeks after that she assigned another project.

She took Generic_Name aside and said ' this time work with somebody"".

Generic_Name listed so he asked somebody to work with him.

The day the project was due, he was nervous because he does not work with people often.

The teacher told him they got a perfect score.

The teacher took him aside and told him why he passed.

She told him he passed because when you have more than just one persons input.

Things become clear so when you do not understand something that other person's input can help.

Another reason I believe working as a group helps is when I was in high school we were assigned a two part project.

The first part I had to do by self.

I got it done when the due date came the teacher told us to pick a partner.

I picked a friend of mine, Generic_Name.

The teacher told us to compare our papers.

However, our paper even though they were on the same subject, they were very different.

She later told us to now write a paper on the same subject but working together.

When we were all done with the two parts she told everyone to rotate their papers to the right once.

Everyone passed them on the teacher then told the whole class to read all three papers and to pick which one made more sense.

When every one was done they all picked the one that made the most sense and gave it to her.

Every single one of those papers she got were all the one people worked on together.

She then asked the class why they did not pick the other one.

They all said because the other papers were one sided as in only one perspective.

Some students may say working alone is better.

However, Generic_Name and I both learned that in some places you need two sides to a story, argument and debate.

If I would have gone on with my life thinking the way I thought before I worked with some one, it would be very different in some perspective.

My friend Generic_Name's life would have been very different too.

Thanks to the team work skill and the skill to listen to other peoples side, Generic_Name and I can make decision with some one instead of just making it alone.

I recommend you talk to your teacher about this and get more group projects going.

Talk to your parents about how you could use those skills in the outside world, become surprised by how much you use them, and by how easier your life become.

When you do not have to make decision alone, decision making becomes much easier.",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5

People will going to try to change your personality but you going to see what is right for you. People can't not change your personality because is your own thought. Some people knows their own personality if they want to be a good characher or bad.

Some people can give bad advice or some people want to trap you. For example at my school their is a lot people that they have bad personality or vice. People need to understand or think before what character they want because everyone is different their thought or feelings. Some people need to choose what character is right for themself.

while some people believe that we choose our characher traits, some people believe that our character formed by influeces beyond our control because they think that influences change their though or actions. Although this might be valide, there are several important ideas to be considered like People need to choose what character traits they want.

Our school gave opportunity to us, students, that will allow us to explore occupation through your internship. Although, some people may say that it will just be a waste of time for students but for me its not. As a student i don't want to miss any opportunity given to me that will help me to be more prepared for the future, give me more experience, and lead me to success.

Firstly, this internship will help me be prepared more for the future. Since I'm still young I still haven't made up my mind on what kind of job i wanted to have, so through this internship i will have the chance to explore the occupations that i can get and make up my mind and have a decision. Therefore, this internship will help me on being ready for the future.

Secondly, this internship will give me more experience. Experience is great way for learning and discovering new things. There's this saying that ""You will never know until you try"". For example, my friend hated the thought of her dancing but when one of our teachers asked us to dance, she discovered that she was really good at dancing. Through this internship i may discover things that never really crossed my mind but actually good at it.

Thirdly, this internship will help me lead to success. This internship will help me plan for my future and not just do anything that will cross my mind. After this internship i already know what job i should get, know what to do and what to expect, and be more confident and more prepared. This internship will lead me to success because it will help me boost up my confidence and help me do better on my future job.

If i were to be selected i will do my best and everything i can for this internship because i don't wan to miss the chance of being prepared for the future, get more experience, and most importantly will lead me to success.",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0

Also students help their parents taking care of their sibling after school, some times also students help their parents at home as clean the floor, wash dishes, make dinner and time for their hobbies, made the life of the students more easy at schools and at home.

students that like to do sports after school as soccer, fotbool, basquelbal, or tennis, some just wants to have a little time of peace by themselves as reading or walking alone those little thing is what a student can miss but if teachers decide to extended the schools to hours late, students also are going to work the same amount of time the only different is that they have to work to hour more each day to complete the forty hours work for week, and those two hours would private students to do what they like to do and make the life more happy.

Some educator feel that the summer break is to long and students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. Others argue that summer break is for students to take a mid break and stop think about school. Schools should not change the break system, because many students and parents had already planed,what they would do during the summer, and because many students work, and by changing the break system it could affect them, and because summer break is for students to relax, get a mid break and stop worrying about school.

The school break system should not be change to 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the the spring, because many students work during the summer and many jobs do not gives students the opportunity to work only a few week or days,they want students work a lest two months so they can be able to give them the jobs, otherwise they would give the jobs to peoples that can stay more time with them. For example I work during the summer, and the company that I work with, only gives jobs to persons how agree to stay more than two months with them, if the school system change, this clear is going to affect me, because I going to lose my job and it would be difficult for me, to find another job during the break, because most of the jobs do not want people, how just going to stay in the company for a few days or weeks.

The school break system should not be change , because students and parents have already planed , where they going to go, and what they going do, and if the school change the brake system, most of the plants that they had already made it, are going to be destroy . for example my bother and my parent visit my grandparents every single year and if the school break system change this could be a problem because they would have to come back more soon, and probably they may not go.

The school break system should not be change, because students have the right to have a long break and stop think about all those worksheet,quizzes, and tests that ,they had already done during the school period,summer break should be a time to relax spent time with family and friends and not a time for be think and worry about school.

Why do they find This Activity Enjoyable.

First, Why do kids find playing video games exciting. Do they believe it's exciting and invigorating to play video games. Video games are exciting to kids because of the action danger and excitement they get each time they play a video game. Are video games a stress reliever for stressed kids and adults. Some video games can be frustrating, but some are relaxing and soothing for the mind like Tetris and Pokemon.

Second, There are many video games in the world that people like to play like Fortnite, League Of Legends, Roblox and more. Kids play games cause of how fun it is. Kids like to play video games like a pack of wolves looking for food. Kids use their senses when playing it's like their getting a mind workout while playing a video games and they just don't know it. adult and kids use 3 senses when playing video games hearing( listening) touch( ability to play) sight (looking around).

School districts programs would be making a big mistake on allowing high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional 4 years.

If they allow high school students to graduate in three years , they would be making everything harder in the Generic_School because students would have to put more effort than ever on passing their classes and the SOL.

In any other state would agree on graduating high school students in 3 years because their rules are different from the the state of Virginia, For example, in Virginia high school students are required to have their SOL passed with more than 400 points, and the 22 Credits instead of graduating for high school.

Other states like Kentucky or Chicago will agree to this because they are required to have 22 credits for their graduation , and it would not be that hard to get 22 credits in 3 years.

It would be a a bad idea to allow students to graduate in 3 years instead of 4 because students would not like to come back to school in summer to do more work, get the credits they need, and make the SOL , as a student i would not like that to happen because we would not get a lot of time for vacations in summer to spend with my family, and i would not like to take courses during the evening , it would be like to be doing a lot of extra work.

People in different states would like to allow this new rule of graduating high school students in 3 years because they can prepare them more everyday doing their work so they can graduate faster in 3 years .

Albert Schweitzer said,"" Example is not the main thing in influencing other; it is the only thing. I believe that if you show good behavior while working or simply going to school with a good behavior that some people will follow your attitude and want to have a positive way on life, however there are other ways of showing good behavior, for example you can help your mother with the groceries and help take the dog for a walk, some might think that good behavior is for the weak, but to be honest it shows that you are mature and that you know how to act around other people or places. If you continue with good behavior you have a higher chance that you will be respected in society even in your own home. good behavior is really a life skill you need for example, your trying to get a job, how are you going to behave in front of the employer? your going to act like a mature adult and tell him that your looking for a job so you can buy a house or a car. so you need to behave correctly in any given situation. It can be hard to behave correctly because some people are very disrespectful and like to get on other people's nerves, but in the end your the one that set a example to everyone else that you know how to act in any situation. dont let other people get to you because then your going to justlash out on everyone else and thats going to make you look bad no matter what. you hsve to show that you are well behaved in any type of enviroment weather its at your house or at work or even at the movie theater you still have to show that you know how to act.

When people want an advice they ask more than 1 person because they want to hear different advice to make sure they don't make mistakes, and they want to hear the right an advice.

I think people should ask for an advice to more than one person, because maybe the first person that they ask for an advice were wrong. For example, when I need an advice I always ask my parents first. I always ask both of them, but sometimes they always have different opinions, parents always have the right advice for you, but the problem is the sometimes they both give you a different advice. Sometimes they told you an advice that you might not like, or the one that you weren't not looking for, and thats when I ask other people about advice like my teachers, friends, brothers, cousins, principals. just to hear what you wanted to hear or the right decision.

Without a doubt, I would ask more than one person for and advice, to hear about others people situations. clearly, I would ask multiple people an advice because you never know who's wrong or who's right, but atleast people give you different opinios, so they're giving you ideas about what you can't or can do.

People should listen to all the advice that people give to them. I always listen to all the advice even if they're wrong i just need to make sure not to make the wrong decision. Sometimes I make mistakes by not listen to the right people.

People ask more than one person because when the first person that you ask and they told you something different, what you really wanted to hear. For example, I personally like to ask my parents for an advice first, but sometimes I don't like what they say to me, so thats when I ask other people like my friends, sometimes you think your friends are right not your parents. But let me tell you something parents are always right it doesn't matter if you don' like them or whatever but they're always right they will never will give you the wrong advice.

I can make the right or wrong decisions because i'm a human and everone had make wrong decision in their life. But sometimes people give you the wrong decision. When I ask for an advice to multiple people, you have to make the right decison. Those people might be right or wrong. I think that asking more than one person for an advice is right because you never know who's right or who's wrong.",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0
15BD3759DC85,"Have you ever thought what life would be like without and with success?

I agree with this quote from Winston Churchill,""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" It's an important role that failure plays in our daily lives. Failure leads to many different directions,But, if we learn our mistakes we can understand what we did wrong. People sometimes have the enthusiasm or optional energy to get thought the obstacles. Some-others don't which it's acceptable for this type of situation. Giving up faith is likely, giving up on yourself as an individual.

Tools are like megalo, it helps us become the person we are today. Tools guide us to consist of good devolpement of character. It can read our thoughts and mind as a reader, when you specifically need them in hand. For example, working on a project from school, you use the internet to find those evidence to support your statement. You may never know that the tools you we're looking for has been sitting their waiting to be taken. You knew it was the item you we're searching for, soon enough it was a success.

Without failures or mistakes, we won't even understood what errors we had. Life would've become a lot harder, stressed, overwhelmed etc. The more mistakes we resolved, more issues fills up. We won't even be able to undo our issues. It would waste more of you're time.

I would argue with this fact, success comes from mistakes and obstacles along the path. It tells us what we should do and not fall into the same hole again. It takes time and effort to adjust,So, we must contribute as a whole.

Therefore, no matter what obstacles we face in life, considering a side-note. There may be a tense of giving up, let it slide. You can active anything in life.                 ",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0
15FD5B635B50,"Did you know 67 percent of people talk to more than one person for advice. They do that because different people might have different views of the situation. Although some people experienced the situation. The advice might be useful for other people too. It can help them agree with the choice or decision they will make.

One reason why some people might ask more than one person for advice is people might have different views of the situation. Some people will have an idea of what to do and some people won't. Some people might tell you to do wrong things. Some people might not know what your going through therefore they will give you bad advice. Some people will know what they are doing so they will give you good advice.

Secondly why people ask more than one person is some people have experienced it or gone through it. They might know what will happen. They might know what you will see and go though during the experience because they probably gone through it.

Finally why people ask more than one person is to make sure that their doing it right or successfully. To make sure that they know what they are doing. To ask their opinions to see if they are thing as you are. To see if you agree with them. They might have a lot in common with with about the situation.

17D51D57629D,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Some people agree with this statement. In my opinion, first impressions are always wrong, and they are possible to change. I have several reasons for my opinion.

The first reason why I dissagree with this statement is because we can not judge on other people from the first sight. Meeting someone and talking to them dose not mean that you know them yet. Some people treat others with different way. For example, if you are close to me and we know each other for long time, I will treat you different than a person who I just met.

The second reason why I dissagree with this statment is because we do not know what other people going through. If you met a person for the first time and this person was rude or aggressive, there should be a reason for this behaviour. Maybe the person had a bad day or perhaps he is going through rough situations. You should think about what you are going to do if you were in the same position. That is why I dissagree with the statement.

In conclusion, I'm against the statement that says the first impressions are almost impossible to change because we should know the person well before we think about any impression. In addition, everything could change and nothing stays the same.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5
192D02CF8C9E,"Having good attitudes is the best way to successes. There is two types of attitudes : a good attitudes and a bad attitudes. Good attitudes can help you in a lot of thing, for example you don't agree with your boss about your paycheck, one thing that you can do is talk with your boss with a good attitude and get to a agreement or talk with a bad attitude and get fire. Good attitudes can also help during a bad or boring times. For example, you and your family are having a bad time in a trip and then you go with a great attitude and make everyone feel better.

Some ways that you can be with a good attitude are : when you sleep well, when is sunny outside, when you get a gift, when you go to your favorite restaurant or you got your favorite food , when your friends go to your house, when you visit your family, when you go to a trip and your having a good time, and so many other ways.

Bad attitudes can take you to the wrong path. A lot of people have bad attitude almost all the time and it's really difficult to get along with them. That type of person does not have a lot of friends or they don't have friends. One example of a bad attitude is when you came to school with a lot of stress and a bad attitude and your teacher do something that you don't like, then you star yelling at him with a bad attitude and your teacher send you to guidance and you get a report card. Or maybe someone else is with a bad attitude and wants to fight and that can go really bad.

Some ways that you can get a bad attitude are : when you are tired, when you got a lot of work, when it's raining and you can't go outside, when someone else got a bad attitude with you, when you are mad at someone, when you are hungry and the food is bad, and some other things.

When I am with good attitudes I always have the best time. Some thing that make me have a good attitude is when I got my favorite food , or a present , or when I am with my family. For example, yesterday was my cousin's birthday in a really fun place, I was with a good attitude because I was playing with my cousin and then we ate really good food. Also I am with a good attitude when my family and I go on a trip, I love to travel because we can visit a lot of new places. Another example is, because my science's teacher was with a good attitude, he give us one more day to turn in a project.

There is so many benefits of having good attitudes. One of them can be when you got a important exam and you study and feel secure about it, then in the next morning you woke up with a good attitude and you take the exam felling secure about your self and with a good attitude, you are going to get a good grade. I think that the best one is having a good time because you are happy and being happy is the best felling that a person can have.

In conclusion, having good attitudes can help you in a lot of thing like in work, school ,and even family reunions. Now you know, the next time that you are felling bad or having a bad time the best way to handle that is having a good attitude.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
197F95A99618,"Self-reliance allows one to follow their own path and make their own decisions. Guidance is taking advise and having other decide what one should do. while guidance can be helpful, it can also be misleading, and people aren't completely following their insticts when other decide for them. Being self-reliance is important due to the fact that if someone make their own decisions, they have the freedom to problems solve. Making mistakes enables one to learn and grow.

With the use of Self-reliance guidance from other human beings unneeded. Those who are self-reliant believe that other human are capable of doing the same tasks that they are. In nature, most animals have to be self-reliant in order to stay alive, for example, as a bear gets older, their parent has to, let them go off in the wild alone. Bears are able to maintain life by finding their own food and shelter.

With the use of guidance, humans and animals learn what works the best for them. Self guidance allows for mistakes to occur, be corrected, and allows for people to find their own solution. Even though not knowing anything or not being able to complete the tasks alone; it is a trait that allows individual to grow and better themselves by finding their own way.

Self-reliance is more than the choose and make one's own decisions. It requires integrity and the will to face up to the challenge that, ultimately betters one's character and work ethic. Solid solving capability leads to more creative.                            ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.0

The people who have positive attitude if good with the family to improve a condition society, or help to the change they attitude. For example, the majority of the person does not have patience with the childrens, or the familty and least the society.

If the people have a good attitude can better in the jod, when make the work with the other people, or when a customer make a question and can be reply with a smile and kindly. For example, in many jod some employee have a bad attitude because when someone asking a question this people reply irate, and the customer irete too, for the attitude of the employee.

I was thinking about the policies you were offering about the cell phones allowed in school and I would suggest to choose policy 2 because students aren't going to follow what the first policy says. Also because student's have no reason to be texting in class if other students they are texting are in class too, students shouldn't be allowed to have phones in school because they would be distracting the rest of the class when their phone goes off in class.

If students can have phones in school it's a sure fact that they're going to be using them in class. With Policy 2 the school can take the phones away at the beginning of the school day to be sure they aren't using the phone during class.

Also with Policy 2 the students aren't able to be communicating just in case they have a test. If the phones are taken away they will reduce the chances of the students cheating on tests.

I also pick Policy 2 because students are going to be distracting the class if someone sent them a message and the phone goes of in class in the middle of a lesson. No one likes to be distracted while they are learning, or at least i know i don't. That's why there shouldn't be phones in schools. With phones the grades of the students will go down because, they aren't paying attention.

I think they should select me because I like to be around people, I want to know what type of jobs I want to do, and I want to have a experiment about jobs.

There are so many people who don't like to be around, but I really like to be around people. I think when I am around people It give you a postive feeling. Anywhere you work or go and your around people It alway give you postive feeling. If you work in a company there will be people that you have to work with even if you like them or don't. One time at my school we were in a group project and I didn't know the people who were in the group and I didn't know what to say. Then I started talking to them and now we are friends. Whenever I am around people even If I don't know them and when I start talking to them I feel like I know them for long time.

So many student alreadys know what they want to do in future, but I don't know yet what should I do. I always ask myself that what I am good at. I never figure it out what is something I am good at. I think not someone can get the jobs they want ,but If they select me to It will give me the opportunities to find out what types of work I am interesting in. It will really help me If I know what work I want to do. There are many people who are not happy with their jobs, but they still have to do it for their family. I think people should choose what jobs they want to do.

If I want to work at a company and I don't know anything about the company how can I work there. I think before you work you should have a experiment so you know what is the jobs about. I wanted to work at a resturants, but I didn't know what kind of work will they have so I ask my friend who have work there. If you don't have experiment you can research about it. There are work where you don't have to have experiment, but in some jobs they want you to have a experiment. I always wanted to be a nurse so I always wanted to learn about nursing. If I get select I would have a opportunities to explore about nurse and I will get to have a experiment.

However you should not select me, but you should because I like to be around people, I want to know what type of jobs I want to do, and I want to have a experiment about jobs. I like to be around people because I think it give a postive feeling.

If I think you should select me because It will give me the opportunities to find out what types of work I am interesting in. I want to choose a jobs that I will enjoy working. It good ideas to have a experiment about a jobs before you work. ",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0

Some jobs look for the days they need their employees, Most places won't hire if you dont got what the job is actually looking for. Its better to find a place you find comfortable working at. Most jobs require-

certain age experience availability

Mangers go for people who they see doing good in their job. For me i know i have job myself and it wasnt easy to find. I had no experience i didnt know anything. I was trained like every other employee at my job, But now i know a lot more positions. If my manager is low on staff he knows he can rely on me to come in and help, better for me i make more hours which makes me makes me happy knowing I'm making money for myself.

Its better having a job where you get along with your employees. Find something your really interested. Dont choose something is gonna make you miserable.

You can used imagination at all time, when you're reading a book, playing or watching your favorite sport, and when your thinking of a place you would like to visit for vacation. You can do a lot of things by only using your imagination.

How can you use imagination when you are reading a book. It depends on what kind of book you love and enjoy to read. I'll give you an example, I like to read adventure books. When I'm reading this type of books I love to imagine how happy would I be if I was that type of person doing that type of adventure. Imagination is an awesome tool to use when you are reading a book. If you love reading this type of books use your imagination, use it to enjoy what you are reading.

Do you have a favorite sport, or a favorite player. Imagine you were a soccer player, a basketball player, or any type of player. Imagine how wonderful and amazing would that be. If I was a famous soccer player I would be Lionel Messy. When I'm watching soccer I start to imagine that I'm Messy and that I'm the one who is scoring all those goals. You can imagine a lot of things, you can imagine you being a scientist, artist, and a actor.

Thinking of a place to visit for vacation. If you have a lot of stress take a break and sit down in your couch and imagine your dream vacation.

Let's say you want your dream vacation in Hawaii. Imagine you are surfing on those big waves, sky diving, and learning how Hawaiian people dance. Also you can learned about the culture and generation about Hawaii.

Imagination is a great thing to have in life. Imagine your adventures when you're reading a book, imagine your favorite player being you, and imagine your dream vacation in any place around the whole world. It doesn't matter how old or young you are, keep using your imagination, if imagination keeps you happy than used it. The only thing you need to worry about is your happiness and the happiness of those who you love the most. Keep imagine all the great things you love to imagine.        ",3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0
1E4E4216EB39,"I believe that schools should not adopt to a four day work week each consisting of ten hours. ten hours of school in one day is too much for a student. not only is this too much time for a student, but it would interfere with sports and clubs that they do. on top of that some students also have jobs that they have during the day.

For some students sports and clubs mean so much to them. they might want that sport as a career. if student were to do the four day work week it would effect them physically and mentally. students might not even make it on time to that four oclock practice or that very important meeting because of the ten hours. being late, not getting much playing time in the sport you wanna exceed in, and worried about school work that you have to make up,and that could lead up to stress.

ten hours in school is a lot of time and that could be too much for a student, it can lead to stressing over too much work and being tired. ten hours can take out a lot of a students day and could interfere with there schedule. student also need free time, with the ten hours they wouldnt have much time because of school work, sports, and jobs. in addition ten hours of school work is just a lot of time, not all student would have that kind of energy to work for ten hours.

students have jobs after school and need money. therefore with these ten hours students wouldnt have much time to work because of school work and other activities. jobs are important to students because maybe parents dont give them everything they need for school. some students struggle with just there overall day schedule. ten hours would make it worse, and wouldnt be good for their heath.

in conclusion students care about sports and clubs, also sees that as a future career. including that ten hours takes too much time out of your day and that you dont have much free time for yourself, family, and friends. students care about jobs because they need money to help them out with school and other things. ten hours in school just wouldnt be right in a whole day when you can only do so much.

I think the best way to have a beneficial and efficient work is doing it in group. So, I have some facts that can convince you to think the same as me. This can benefit eveyone on the group because all can share ideas ,we can work in the difirents parts at the same time, they have more time on the breaks ,and they have more time to review the work and checks if there is a problem.

I notice doing in group is more efficient and can help improve the working on the on projects or works. First, I think that share ideas with the group will benefit you and all the group. So, they all can have ideas to continue and do not minds in blanc. This will be helpful for the groups because we are more efficient than do it separate. Also, I think this benefit every one on the group to do not get struggle because we are out of ideas.

I know that working in group is a benefit because every one in the group is having more breaks than they will have doing separate . Also , this help every one in the group because we are less probable to stress because we all have more times on the breaks to be relax. although, they can work in differents are of the work at the same time. So, every one working in different parts benefit they because they are working faster and efficient. I think we can get more time to help each other on the work and this is great because we learned and help the group to have a good work.

Every one doing this in group is a benefit and helpful way. So, doing this in group is helpful because every one can check differents part of the work and look if they find a mistake. Also, I think this is help because maybe a person did not see a mistake another one can see and can help fix it. I think all the group will benefit and we will notice the difference by working alone and working in group. Last, this benefi every one on the part they work because help about finding mstake and review if they something wrong.

I think doing a team work is good because every one can improve their skills or habilities .

If you have trouble making friends at school don't worry, in Art you can meet people that share the same likes as you. Art helps you socialize, you can ask people for help on a specific topic and they can teach you what you never knew about. In Art you can meets people with different likes, even though they have a different way that they think of Art, Everything is still related.

In Art you can make drawings, paintings, sculpting and many more, Art is created every time you use your creativity and mind. You can express your creativity by creating Art, you can let all your emotions fill in just one drawing, painting, or others. In Art, creativity is most important and it is needed to create masterpieces, You can also express your skills of a specific topic or you can learn more and many other ways of Art.

When you think about Art you probably think of drawing or painting, right? Thats not all to Art, there is an endless amount of ideas you can do in Art.

Art includes letting your creativity flow, never ending ideas to do, and helps you socialize. I recommend this to students of any school, to see if they have an interest in Art or if they find it enjoyable.

20BC5CCE8C64,"""SNORE, SNORE"" every time that I do something I do not I feel so lazy. I think if we accomplish more if we are always doing something. I believe that your mind do not get lazy and you feel productive. For example, if you go to school, have a job, and help other people. If you do many things every time later on you always will want to do something. I also know that you can do something without doing nothing and one them is been at of problems. Like Thomas Jefferson wrote,"" never to be idle"" that means that do not be the type of people that do not like to do nothing.

First, I believe if you go to school you will accomplish more because your mind is going to be busy. In my opinion, I feel that I do a lot more than just not do nothing because: I wake up on time ,I go to school every day, I do my homewoks after school, and I feel productive by going to school. Also when I do not understand something I ask the teacher for help and if my classmate need my help I do my best by giving them information about the class. If I keep my mind busy I feel good because I experience talking with my classmate.

Second, having a job help you by giving you experience for the future. For example, when I started working In my first job I learned a lot things like how to use a computer, I though that I was never going to learn it but I did it and now it help me for my education. Next, now I know that the way of accomplish something you need to have interest to do it. If you do not have interest or if you want to do nothing you never are going to accomplish anything because the best way of do it is by doing something. In my second job I did not know how to use a cellphone but I put all my interest to learned and help my customers by taking their orders. Now in my third job I know many things like :

answer the phone, take orders, and especially how give a good customer service.

Third, I think helping other people is way of accomplish something. If you help people like homeless you are going to have the opportunity to talk to them and understand why they do not have a place to live or a family to support them. I think this is the best way because some people prefer to leave their home because they do not like the rulers of their parents. This is not the best solution that people should take because everyone need a support of someone. And the best way of accomplish something no matter what it is is by obey and listen the old people who always have the right because they have more experience than us. For example, one day I was homeless because my parents left me with my two brothers and I did not have food to give to them every time that they asked for food my eyes were tearful because they were little and also they did not understand the situation. Now when I see people asking for food it remain me that one day I was like them.

I chose to write about we accomplish more if we are always doing something. I believe that you accomplish a lot of things by always doing something and I said by going to school, find a job, and helping other people. I believe t I also know that you can accomplish other things by doing something different but I chose help my self and others. Also I understand that you can accomplish something by doing nothing but one of then is by been at of problems. By doing all of this I considerate my self accomplishing many things.",3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0
20CF9410DC4A,"Is a good or bad idea to choose a carrer being young?

To begin, in my opinion choose a career being a young student is a good idea because it is a great opportunity for them. Imagine people can choose their profession since their youthness. For example, if they think that they want to be a doctor and at that moment they do not like that profession, they can opt for other career on time. Also, taking that decision many people assure their future, for example if they know what to do when they come to the adult stage, they going to be successful because they going to learn many things since young, and that helps to get better their knowledge. Therefore, doing careers help to people to keep their mind busy in their careers and studying hard and using their time to do good things, like do not using drug or wasting their time being a vandal. As well, if all the people do it, the world will be a place full of privilege, with porfessional people around, having trust and support on each other.

To conclude, doing career is one of many opportunities that we have in this country, so we have to use it, because it help us to be good person and get better our skills to be a professional. Furthermore, we have to learn how to focus in really important things. Also, it teach us how to become a successful human and fight for our goals since young. As well, it is good to learn how to be a independant person because if you study hard, your future will be full of success, so you do not need other people to do anything you want.

214EC21D1403,"I agree that positive attitude is the key of success in life. Because the importance of having a good attitude is to never doubt yourself that you can't do it when all you have to put is work. Working hard is most of the common things you can do to pass High School and College. Then you start searching up for things that you're interested to do after you finish college like a job which you have to have a positive attitude to pass the interview and treat customers good. Positive attitude will change your life forever.

One, Having a positive attitude will get you anywhere. You want to have a good image that its positive. You have to be hopeful and confident about the future. In many places is hard to find a good successful job, which all you have to do is have good attitude in front of the manager and if you get it keep your head up always don't let that ruin you. For example, their is a lot opportunities for a good successful job, but you have to keep working hard until you get what you wanted.

Two, Feeling good about yourself is sometimes what you need to have success. If its necessary to take away people to have good feeling about you is good so you can focus more on want to do in life. You are the only person that can control yourself or behavior. Take little five minutes to think and prove to yourself that you can do it without any help. For example, If you don't like Monday mornings all you have to do is reflect a positive thought on your mind that will make you happy the rest of the day.

Three, Show your best work by doing right thing in life to success. If you have you head up always and sometimes you need to think is good for yourself which make you a better person my reflecting a good image. Be honest to yourself and never take life for granted. Is important that you have a good positive attitude by doing this stuff which will led you to a good successful career. For example, You have a big interview that is gonna require a lot hard work cause this can define your future and you want to be successful in life overall if you pass and have all the techniques you need you're good then, but if not then you will keep trying until you get it right.

I agree that positive attitude is the key of success in life. In this life you can be whatever you want,but all you have to do is work hard. Have a positive mind set and positive attitude this will led you to have a good things in life. Have faith on yourself to get back what you want. The success don't come along in just one day you have to keep working hard to reach the top and have what you always wanted.

As an illustration, every people comit defeats, yet that can teach us to be more stronger people,and never give up. People will grow only if they start being independents, trying new things, and learn to be better by they own self.

By being more independently, people will learn how to take their own decisions. People can start taking their own decisions when they do not live with their parents anymore. As an illustration, they can find a good work, pay their own things, and having the capacity to make their owns decisions. Besides, people have to have more responsability; in order to take a decision because that can affect ourselves. However, that can makes us more stronger, and be more prepared in life.

Trying new experiences can also, teach us to be more independently, and learn about others people experiences in taking a decision. In fact, we can ask for advices to our parents or in someone that we trust because they will tell us what is good or what is bad for us. Additionally, sometimes there is people that the only thing that they do is judge us for the decision that we take, but that does mean that we are a bad person. We can propose to ourselves everything, and we should never get down.

Learn to be better by our own self ca help us in many ways. that can be a benefit into our life because in the ways we can be more responsables with ourselves. For example, we can take many decisions , but sometime we do not know if they are going to be good in the way how we planed them. Besides, we always can try to be a better person, and think more about every decision that we choose.

The children wants to have a normal school day. And they have to prove that they can do it,they believe in their self.

First,It is boring because they want to have fun. And the reason why it is a lot of fun because they want to have a good time. And thet can think about what they want,What do they want to do when the schools are thjnking about staying more longer at school. For example, Generic_Name went outside to play after school.

Secondly,it is stressing because they would be crazy about it. And the reason why it is stressing because the blood of the brian would get bad. It would be horrible that they have blood pressure,haert attacks,and they want to kill there self. They can't do that,but they can protect there self. For example,Generic_Name was taking a test but she got nervous,Frustrated,lonly and upset.

Thirdly,it is irritating because kids will get tired and dizzy at school. the reason why it's because their body do not have enough energy. For example,My best friend

In closing,I disagree that the school plans to add more time at school. And it is a bad idea,It would get irritating,boring and stressed. In my opinion it is better for kids so they can not worried about it. And it would be easier step by step and keep going,Dont stop doing it.

23958A3106EA,"The work in group will always have an excellent results. I feel working in group have several benefits than working alone. When we hear that we are going to work alone it sounds good but not for all. It should be great for those people who don't have the capacity to work with others. Even you do not believe it, working in group is feature that no all humans have it. Why I think like that? because working with other people we help us to learn different types of job, we can able to work in others areas with others folks, we can meet amazing people.

To begin with, working in group can help us to learn different types of job. I have my own experience with this. When I started my first job I didn't learn enough. I worked in a hotel and people there liked to work alone. Sometimes I didn't know how to do something and I immediately asked but those workers didn't like to teach others, and they said you should learn by yourself. Obviosly I didn't agree with them and I started to find different job where I could learn more. Working alone was the most diffucult job I've ever had. I could't learn from others because they didn't give me the opportunity to do it. Now I got experience from others how to work in restaurant, markets or shopping centers. I think you will learn hundred percentage better if you are learning from others. However, some people claim that work alone is more beneficial to concentrate, but I insist that work with someone else with leave you more knowledge than work alone.

To continue, if we worked before in commuties or in group we are able to work in different areas of work and also work with different folks, it will be easier for us. When we are looking for a job in our interview the boss or managers will always ask if we have problem to work with others. They ask this questions because they want to be sure that we will work in different places and we will interact with the other employees. If we anwser NO, I'm really sure that we won't get job soon. If we are willing to learn and work together as a team we'll have success in every job that we get. If we change of jobs is because we are looking for something better, and we will achieve working in different areas learning diffrente jobs, acquiring experience from others, showing that we are able to work with others, all these can be beneficial for us when we are looking for job.

In addition, we can meet amazing people working in group. When we work with others we are making friends. My mom found her best friend Generic_Name in her job. They have eleven years with this beutiful friendship. Everyone needs a friend that can help, teach and learn with you. Think about it, there are more benefits working with someone else than working alone. Even though some people say that working in group is more complicated because you will find people who don't want to teach how to work or it can be distracting for you. I feel sure that there are more people good than bad and also if you know your work, you know what to do in your job there aren't people or thing distracting for job. We should be responsable with our job this is an important thing that you shouldn't forget. In schools, in works or in the street we'll find amazing people who will help to improve our skill as workers or as humans being.

To sum up, working in group will help us to find better jobs, to learn new thing, to interact with different people.

24050FFA49AE,"I think cell phones gives negative effects on people lives. I think its a negative effect on people lives because a lot of people are scared to talk to people face to face, People like to look at social media all day. I see alot of people like at resturants using there phones while eating and no one talking to each other. I see a lot of kids using phones while eating like playing games or watching movies on there technology. A lot of parents get mad at there children because they use there phone all day and they cant have at least 30 minutes to talk.

I see a lot pf people posting pictures on social media. I know people posting pictures on social media all day. Theres a lot of people that take pictures and videos what they do in there lives. I think technology made use worst because we can't live without looking at social meia at least once a day. I think people should go out and have fun with friends or family or finding a job so you will be too busy to think about your phone or technology. If your busy or doing something you wont tgink about your phone or technologies. A lot of people like to stay home and use technology all day at home and i think thats not good. Its nice going out with friends or family having a good time without using technology. The time goes faster when your are busy or doing something but if you use your phone it eems the time goes slower.

I thik sometimes technology could be good use. I think it would be good because you can read books and search up anything you need .Technology is good when we use it in school because its easier to do our work. If you need to build or anything or need anything you can search it up on your technology and it will show you how to do it. I only use my phone for Maps, Music, and to search up things i need to know. I dont like using my phone to be on social media all day i work so i use my phone for work not to be on social media all day. If you need to do homework and find the answer you can search it up on your technology. I think technology is good when you need something important to do on it.         ",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0
25518B329285,"The school board is planning to add one and a half hour to school each day. I think they should add one and a half hour to school each day because than class would be more longer, we would have to do more homework, and some students have things to do after school everyday.

I disagree that the school board should add one and a half hour to school each day because class would be more longer. If schools board add one and a half hour to school each day every class would be more longer. For example my civics class is two hours if they add one and a half hour than my civics class would be two and a half hour. If class was longer teachers would have to work more. They would have to work more because than they have to make more projects and grade more papers that each student turns in. Students would have to work harder then what they usually do because they would get more work because the class is longer.

Secondly I disagree because if school board adds one and a half hour to school each day then we would get more homework. students would have to do more homework since class is longer that would get more projects and some students don't get to finish their work in class so they have to do it for homework. They would get in trouble if they don't finish their homework. some students don't get to finish their homework because they have to do more work for another class.

Lastly, I disagree that the school board should add one and a half hour to school each day because when students get out of class they have to do things or go somewhere. Students have to take care of their siblings. Some students when they get out school have to take care of their brothers and sisters because their parents have to go somewhere or they have to do some work. Some kids practice sports in the afternoon for example soccer, basketball , etc. When I get out of school I have to go to soccer practice at 4:30 pm ,so before going to practice I have to do my homework and sometimes I don't get to finish then until I come back from practice. Sometimes I do get in trouble with my teachers because I didn't finish my homework. Some students have to go visit their family because maybe that are going to a party that they are making or they are sick and you have to go see how they are. Sometimes my mom waits for me until I get out of school to go visit our family. Some of then have to clean their room, wash the dishes, and take the trash out.

I still think that they shouldn't add one and a half hour to school each day because each would longer, get more homework, and do after school activities. Do you agree or disagree with my reasons?",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

When you're yourself with them and show them who you really are, they want to change you. Some peaple are always going to talk and pay more atenttion to the mistakes that you made instead of what you have to offer , being yourself in this world is the most importan thing in life, because you got to show them that you like who you are and you don't care what they say, love yourself inside and outside never stop doing what you love just because people told not to do it, do what makes you happy not what makes other people happy. don't be afraid to show the world what you got to offer, you only live once, feeling good about yourself is more important then satisfied other people.

263C2C01BC08,"I disagree with extending the school days, because is too much for the students and teachers, also not fair for teachers to work more them they do, and finally not that good because all the other schools are going to get earlier. Having not much sleep can effect students grades and classwork, This can effect teachers also just like the students.

Students wouldn't feel that well with adding one and half hours to school, because they need to study and rest well. Adding all that time to school would effect after school activities, because students would not feel like they had much sleep or they did not study for something that is due for school the next day. Students would not feel well rested because they had to wake up at a early time and then coming back to school, after they come back from school students are looking forward for a nap but they can't because they have chores to do.

Another thing is that students would not have time to do their chores that their parents told them to do, because they have homework or have to go to their soccer, swim or gymnastic practice. Adding one and half hours to school would affect the students a lot with activities and school work and also their sleep.

One more thing this would effect teachers work because they have to leave school later then before. Also teachers wold not have much time with their family afterwards. Another thing is that teacher are going to have to work even more in their things for the classwork. It would also make it difficult for them because they are going to have to spend more time in school instead with their kids or family.

2723DB12AC00,"Let me ask you this question What's better then waking up and, knowing that you are getting your education at home? with that in mind Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. I think students will highly benefit from atending classes from home. Because not everyone learns the sameway. some students struggle to stay in school all day and, most of them can't listen to teachers talking for 90 minutes straight.

I feel like less students will drop out of high school. Some students are anti social and, don't like being in a place where everyone likes to judge you or, talk about you. Students don't have to stressed out about work that is not finished in class so, homework will be a thing in the passed. People like me will have more time to play sports and, be with family. Most people carrey a ten pound backpack but, with online classses all your work will be saved in a computere. The will hightly benefit people who are not the best with keeping papers in order. The future are our computers and, builting a strong skill with computers is a great treat to have.

Online classes is the future and the future is here. Students are benefiting from online classes but, some students comeback into public schools because they learn better face to face with a teacher, and not steering at a screen all day. Alot of colleges accept students who got their diploma online but, studies showed that a lot of students who got their education online had a hardtime adopting into the colleges.

28FF89DC3B40,"Have you ever had some tell you that you have to play a sport or get involved with clubs or an activity? Would you agree or disagree to participate in any activity in school? I disagree because student might not like any of the options, have no time ,and want to just want to be with family.

My first reason, is that student might not not like any of the sport,clubs or activities that they are offering at school. Many student do not want to get vary involved with school to much. They just what to go to school to learn,get good grades and pass. Some students do not think they are good at sports or clubs. student just do not want to worried about the games the days they have to stay. There are other students that might like other actives out of school. Like riding bikes,or they might be more in valved with church. They might be in a youth group at church and can not be involved with other things cause it nigh get stressful to deal with two things. This is why some students would not want to get involved.

There for,some student do not have the time to join a team or do any clubs or activity. If a student has to join a sport or club after school. Some students would not be able to go or get picked up. The parents of the student might have to work long hours and every day of the weeks. There for, the students would not be able to get pickup after school. Which means that if the student would want to play a sport he would not be able to cause they have to work to proved for there families, which would make them not be able to show up for the games or clubs. some student might have to go home and take care of there little sisters or brother at home. They might even have to cook and clean up cause there parents are working or there are problem at home. there are so many things student have to do at home depending on there life style at home. There are also families that get home and have to help there mom out in the kitchen and clean up and get read for to go to church. There would be no time to join an active cause there would be no time to get piked up cause you might live far away from the school. This is why I disagree with making student join school activates.

My final reason is that student might just spend time with their families. Many student might get home and there is no one wanting for them at the door. both of their parents are working. They might not even see them at all or maybe only a couple of hours. But it is those horse that they get to see their family and get all together and have dinner talk to gather about how their day went and what they did. But in the other hand there are kid that only see their parents once cause they come from work very late and go to work very early and you have to go to sleep cause there is school the next day. It would be very dad to not even see your parents or talk to them or even give them a huge or say i love you. And your dont get to do though stuff cause you are at school doing sports or in a club.

This is why i disagree that student should have to participant in an activity. There are so many stuff that student might have to do out of school that makes them not be able to join a club,sport or any other activity that they offer in the school.              ",3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0
298969937643,"I am against this issue because, it's just not a good idea for student's to graduate high school early, and enter the work force and college one year early. My reasons for this would be that, those who do graduate early will miss out on school activities. They will have to do so much preparation. Some don't see that after high school life get's tough, and who knows if they'll be able to handle it.

Early graduate's will graduate a year early, but, they don't realize that they will miss out on school activities. Some activities that excite student's would be, the school dances such as prom, and homecoming. Dance's are meant to enjoy a night with friend's, and get all dressed up for the night. Also the day before a dance, there is always a football game, which is exciting because everyone goes to support the team and if they win they celebrate the day after, which would be at the dance. Pep- rallies are when all four grade levels come together and verse each other on which class has the loudest cheer, and who has the most point's when it comes to the games they end up playing. Spirit week is also when all classes verse to win point's. To earn the point's they must dress up as the theme of that day or buy what is being sold that day. The theme's they would usually do would be twin day Monday, polka dot Tuesday, and for the sells it would be spirit chain's that get hung up. Senior activities are when all the graduate's do their last activities with those classmate's they've been knowing since elementary school. They have a senior picnic which is when only the seniors go and have lunch together. Also some go on a class trip and they take their class picture.

Even though early graduate's will miss out on school activities there's more important things than that. They might think that they are ready, but in reality they don't think about the preparation they need to face. Depending on what diploma they are headed for either the standard or advance, each diploma has its requirements for graduation. Standard diploma's really don't ask for much. There might be a chance that you won't be in need of doubling up on classes. Unlike the advance diploma it ask's for so much. An advance diploma may require you to double up due to the fact that it requires many classes. Also students won't be able to take any of those exciting elective courses that are by most the best classes a student could take. Of course the classes aren't the only thing that must be completed, there are many test's that take place. Math, science, history, and the most difficult would be the English test. They must pass each test for graduation. This would mean that, students won't have time to distract themselves' by other thing's, and, will have to stay on task to maintain their grades up. Some might say otherwise that if they're going through this road it's because they are aware and are ready.

Although graduating early excites them, it is better if they wait another year and graduate when they have to. My reason to this would be because the work force and college will be completely different than high school. High school might be the easiest part of starting to understand life. Most student's that graduate early are juniors, and are sixteen and seventeen years of age. This is pretty difficult at that age, they would have a hard time finding a decent job that will help them pay their tuition; unless they have another way of paying like a scholarship or some other way. Perhaps some might do both work and school at the same time, but, it could end up being too hard on them because they are too young and aren't as prepared as they thought. If some were to be at the age of eighteen they would have to face adult responsibilities; such as taxes, rent, insurance, and much more.

However some might think otherwise. People who favor this issue support early graduation. Their reasoning would be that it's an early start in life, and some students do it certain reason. It could be a family matter or other reasons. But, I disagree, in no way is graduating high school early good. Those student's that graduate early will miss out on so many good thing's that come with high school. They will be stressed due to so much they had to do just to get out a year early; if that didn't stress them out then having to go college and going to work to pay for their education will.

Today in the actuality is easier to take classes or courses, online or video conference, because the system of education is always trying to improve them self as everything in the world. The internet is our big source that we need everywhere and in different circumstances and the technology is a big advance that has a lot of benefits for us, like make our life easier.

My point of view about the student attending classes from home. First, most of the students in High School are teenagers, if they are in their homes taking classes it make the possibility that they do not socialite with the people and they can not find a firm personality. Second, the students could have problems in their vision in cause of the long time looking a monitor, laptop, tablet, Etc. Third, some of the students are beneficiary of their free lunches in school, so, if they are in home it will be more expensive for the parent to pay extra food. To conclude, those were some of my points of views or disagrees about attend to school from home.

This is a list about the agrees and it could be a benefit in my opinion:

Do not have to spend gas going to school.

Do not spend in different clothes everyday.

The government, do not have to pay a lot of teachers, so maybe taxes can get lower.

We can use a different schedule to see classes, and the other time to work.

The students do not have to socialize with the teacher, so, no disagrees and problems between the student and the teacher.

This ideas was basically what i think about attend classes from home, maybe it could be better or maybe no, the mostly reason i think is fine to attend school from home is, if you have a disability or sickness that don't let you go to school.

2B9FE67B7465,"Thesis

: I believe that my school should not fallow this model because a lot of people get tired of school. Teachers get more tired than students because they work all year to make our classes and teachers need a break from school more than us, the students.

It is okay to go to the school the five days of the week. It doesn't matter how hard school is, if you go the five days of the week you get less tired because classes are more shortest and you don't have to be is school the whole day. Also you have more time outside of school to go to work or go with your friends to have fun and forget of school for a bit.

First, if schools do extend classes is gonna be more stressful and tired because you are going to be in school for a longest time and a lot of people don't even like school. Some people really hate school because is really hard for everyone and there are some classes that you don't even have an idea of what you are doing. Teachers know when someone is tired and they let them sleep for a while because maybe they know how is it feel being tired. Schools need to have the same schedule and don't change anything.

Second, schools are not like work in a job because in a job, you have more responsibilities and they also have rights that you need to comply. Being in a job is the double stressful and tired than being in your school learning a lot of new things. Some people say that work is better than go to school, but I say that they all are wrong because sometimes in school you do nothing, you just are listening to what the teacher says and in a job if you have a little break, you use it to eat or make another job that you need to do later.

They should not extend the school day but the should do it with jobs.

Third, if schools extend classes you won't have time to sleep well. That's the most important thing for students, sleep well to come to the school with a good attitude. A lot of people talk about other's attitude because they are always angry, bored, or lazy but they have no idea if they sleep well or not. Some people make fun of them because they fall to sleep in classroom and that's not right, the right thing is ask that person how is he feel, or if he is okay. The less you sleep, the most tired you get and sometimes you don't even can concentrate in classroom. Most of the students that don't sleep well and they have a job after school, they have a hard time in school because most of the times being in school is stressful as a job.

Conclusion

: Is not necessary to extend school day two more hours because it's gonna be the same any ways. Two more hours in four days don't change anything because is like you are adding Friday in that four days. The same eight hours in Friday, you are going to add to the four days of classes. They don't need to change anything because teachers won't have enough time to get ready our classes for the next day and they won't have time to even cook food at home or clean their house. Sometimes students above 18 years old live single and they need to work every single day because they need a lot of money to pay their bills like: house, car, phone, internet, food, and clothes. Some of them are about to have a baby and having a baby is a huge responsibility for him because he need to work over time to win more money or have two job. He is gonna be really really stressful and tired, and he won't have time to come to the school the whole day.",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,4.0

But do you think that it is a good idea to graduate in three years insted of four years? Well yes it's a good idea ,there is nothing wrong with gradutating in three years .Maybe he or she just wants to get over high school and start working .Or others just want to start a year early of college .

Some students want to graduate early because they want to start working and making money. They just want to start making moeny and start buying the things they need .There is nothing bad with going into the work force a year early ,students may not like school and just decide to gradute in three years so they can go stright into work field,Everyother student has a diffrent mind set .

High schoolers also would want to gradute early to start off with their college classes,colleges classes are hard and some students just want to finish and complet certian classes they want .Colleges give out alot of work and its hard ,and its not a bad idea to gradute a year early just to start off with your college classes .You get done with like three classes and college wont be as challenging and hard. Students just think ahead and take the option of only taking three years of high school ,and it pays off towrds the end.

Other students take the three years because they dont like school and just want to get finished and complet with high schoool .Other students do it because some have to take care of their families or other students had a child and have to work for that child .Everyone has a diffrent mindset and they all think diffrently from one another.

Taking three year of high school is helpful and good ,But taking 4 years is better because you get a better education and you can get scholorships from colleges .You can also finish you colleges classes in high school and you get more help ,taking four years in high school is helpful too .

This friend I have is really nice, a hard worker, and always helps me with school things a lot. Sometimes when I struggle she is always there and knows when i'm trying to hide my problems away from them.

I met this friend in fifth grade my friendship with my friend is really special. Now, I know what their personality is like, and when it comes stressful, wonderful, sad, special, and other moments in their life I can always find a way to make them feel better. I can always count on them because they know how to always work things out, they can also be very fun and silly at the same time which is great. We can always study together, play games, and do a lot of fun activities. We always joke around about a topic and create silly ideas to make it funny and entertaining to make more jokes. We were really happy to be with each other even though we had to know each other more.

I only met them in fifth grade but we became really close in seventh grade. When we entered in seventh grade they didn't have any of their friends in any of their classes, I was, but in only one. This only class they had me with them was the class we had every day to see each other in. They didn't know anyone besides me because we had already met but they didn't know anyone. They were really shy back then but I helped them to make more and new friends besides the ones they already had and me because I was in only one of their classes but not in the others. Then they made new friends in other classes which they are still friends with other people, they introduced me to their new friends and they were really nice and I was really happy for them being friends with new people.

We both know that their a really hard worker, they could also be trusted and a special friend. Now, when it comes to us being older we might fade away from each other as time goes by, no one knows when one of us will change or leave but, if we get separated and change I will know it's them only by looking into their heart no matter how much they change I will find them again because once a best friend always a best friend.",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5

I strongly believe that we acomplished more if we are always doing something. if everyone would think the same way we all can reach beyond more. Students now days they don't have a lot of goals or motivation in life .And if we determine ourself to keep going; we will succeed in life. Attending collegue or always being involve in daily activity such a yoga clases, painting or being involve in afterschool programs. It will determine us not to be worthless.

First of all,as we finish HIgh school we all should attend college . And keep our education going beacuse the more knowledge we get the smater we are. I personaly feel that i acomplished more when I focused on reaching my goals.

As a prepare myself to graduate this year from High School. Im looking forward to go to colllege to study Early childhood. Attending college is going to be one of my biggest dream. And looking foward to become a professor. The key to sucess is to work hard.

Sencondly, being involve in daily activities give people joy and feel motivate. Some people loves helping in after programs or during school. As we get involve in this activies; we acomplish a lot by helping people that they need and also it helps us humas to be better for our community. My sister helps an afterschool program that helps the little kids to do their homework and some crafting project . She shares with me that working on this gives her gratitude and is helping her on the career that she is studying. Persuing this goals brings us pleasure because we are helping others.

2D508127DEF1,"There is a debate today day about whether the students should study from home or school. Many people agree that the appropriate way to study is going personal to the school. My idea is that they are well understanding when the students go to the school because they have mutiple attention. Here are some reasons why many students master a course in school rather than online courses. First they can ask questions at any time, second improvement on learning new topics, and last friends support in group work.

First, many teenagers who take online courses still have questions or guesses on their answers. Here some reasons why many on the students does not master some courses. The classes related with Math, Chemistry, and History are the complicated for most learners. Those who are assisted by a teacher are the ones with the chance of clarify any problem related with numerical or logic problem; also the teenagers can make corrections in their work by asking for solutions. While the students with online courses are involved with more guesses, but the course program does not provide clear answer or does not provide an answer.

Second, the improvements in schools classes vary depending the faculty member you are with. Online games made by the teachers related with the actual topic makes the topic easy by practicing in the game, also entertain them at the same time keeping their minds relaxed and widely open to process more information within the game. Other teachers prefer individual activities with certain amount of exercises provided in previous classes. Those improvements help to find new ways to solve a problem, hints, and interpretation of the problems. The online courses does not provide incentives for students allowing them to decrease the interest in the process.

Finally, friends. They provide self confidence by asking an unclear problem and having different points of view at the same time. The opinions provided for the people you know encourage them to keep it up; there's some times the teacher explanations does not clarify at all and your group provides detailed explanations of a process. The efficiency in the group is enforced by dividing the labor and finishing soon; them the work can be shared with the people at the table, explaining how the process was made, and at the same time they can make corrections in what the other person have done. Different than the online practice made by the person self can take weight longer to get an specific difficulty.

Those are the reasons why many people prefer the schools rather than house. The help in questions by the teachers, improvement in learning in different ways, and the support of people you know and you feel confident with. Those reasons allow students to be better at something they aren't with the help of someone that knows more about the course. This people that provide assistance is a boost to keep track in school related.",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0
2D5A9BEEB30D,"Do you agree or disagree with extending the school day. I disagree with extending the school day. The 3 reasons why i disagree with extending the school day is that the students will get home late,the school will need to spend more money on students,and the students will get more tired.

First of all,the students will get home late. The students won't have have time to do after school sports nor activities. The kids will not have time to do homework nor study. The students won't have time to do fun things on their own time.

Additionally,the school will need to spend more money on students. The state will need to raise taxes for the schools. The school will need to spend more money on bills for utility. The schools will need to spend more money on supplies and food for kids.

Finally,the students will be more exhausted. The students will be exhausted because they will need to do work for extra hours. Students who do after school sports or activities will not get enough sleep because they will be getting home late. The students will get home past there bed time and they have to eat dinner.

In conclusion,the three reasons why is disagree with extending the school day is that students will get home late,the school will need to spend more money on students,and students will be more tired.",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,5.0

Next, to be honest a lot of success can harm you because they can'tcontrol them self and invest their money anywere like in casino in Alcohol,Druges, and all that can harm your feature like your kides gonna be have so much money he will get everything what he need sport Car, nice House, so he will think i dont have to do anything he dose'nt have the stress on his mind to do somthing in life in small age he will smoke Cigrate and Drink Alcohol.

Then, if you control your success in right position your feature gonna be amazing like obama he is the Presedent of United State of America he have a so much power in his hand to do anything, but the most important thing is he know how to use that power he have big coltrole on his success he also have lot of money,but he don't have any bad habit like Drug or somthing he also made his feature good and he say to his two daughter he say to them go and find work for your self you guys can dependenton me you have to satnd on your legs and show the world what you can do every.

On the other hand, big example of the presedent of India first he was on the street he selling tea and he dose not have enough money to study,but luck is most important in our life his luck chang and he is the presedent of india he did so much stragle and hard work in his life and get success,but he don't have any controle on his success and he invest money on useless things and people in india say he is not a good for

India people hat him he higher the cost of fule,food,elericety,rent and more, and if he had the controle on his success India was gonna be like America.

Finilly, I campare both American and Indian presedent and see the success and failure power in my opinion the United State of America have the success controle power that's why people like to leve there and they also like there presedent,and India dose not have success power that's why people dose'nt like presedent,and they don't want to leve their, so this is the power of success if you use carefully you good but if you don't you die.

In my opinion, I'am totally agreed to his wisdom of words by Wilson, Churchile, because there are many persons in general that could shows that the fauilures is part of success without loss of love to what we do.

For instants, A famous and big star NBA and MVP basketball player Micheal, Jordan once said that, the process of being successful is an action of repaetation of practice including failures. This clearly indicates, before micheal became a successful basketball player star, he recieves and faced hardship competing and playing basketball in sevelar yaers of his caceer in NBA. In addition, According to micheal's father, he said, micheal fails so many times to his dream caceer such as: physically, emotionally and, mentally. However, he didn't stop chasing his dreams because, I know and, he knows how much he loves playing basketball.

2E8A8C550F8D,"This essay is about some schools offer distance learning as an option for the students attend classes form home by way of online or video conferencing , I think some students would benefit from take classes by their houses, because some students work in the night this is a problem for the students who working in the night because the school start 7:30 this is to early for some students because they work and they don't sleep well.

Example one is about my friend he work after school sometimes he work between

5 to 12 and he after this he need to wake up at 5 for go to the school , I think this is heavy for him because he always is tire in the first class because he can sleep well in the night , but he need to graduated from high school because this is the only way he can have a better life. Many students in high school work after school , I think this program can help they because they can continue working and they can sleep more , this can help they to have a better grades because they can sleep more because sometimes they have a bad grades because they don't have the time to do the homework and the study for the test .

Example 2 is about the many girl in high school are pregnant , this program can help this girls because I see many girls don't want to return to high school , when they are pregnant because when they're pregnant sometimes people say bad thinks about they ,because they're to young for have a baby. but with this program they can take the classes from their houses .This can help they to graduated from high school because this is a better way to completed their classes , cause sometimes many girls decide to continue in the normal schools but when they have the baby they can not to continue because they need to take care for the baby. but with this program they can finish their classes.

For my conclusion this is a good idea because they can help many students who have some problems . because they can finish high schools , because they don't have time because sometimes they need to work. but with this program they can help this students because this is a good idea for help this students . because they can benefit if they take the classes from their houses.",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0
2EA9DA7AAD2C,"Thomas Jefferson said ""determine never to be idle."" What he means is that people should not just sit there and do nothing for their whole life because it won't help them accomplish their goals. Some people say doing something serves a purpose. Others say that inactivity also serves a purpose. Doing nothing at all is a bad choice. The best option to serve a purpose is to actually do something by helping others and the world then staying idle and not doing anything to help others.

First, the reason why Thomas Jefferson said that people should never be idle is because he wants to change their lives forever. Another reason why people should take this advantage is that if people don't do any activities in their life, then they won't be able to achieve their goals in the future. Most people will say this, ""doing something serves a purpose because it could help other people get their work done."" It's good to start doing activities at a younger age because they will be able to experience it and get used to it later on. Also, doing activities can help them gain more respect and they could get famous. It could be too late to start doing activities when they are older, but people just have to think of what they are going to do to fix it.

Next, most people will say that they don't know what activity they should do. For example, i didn't want to do any activites like other people did so i went and did karate for 4 years. A year later I started to swim every Saturday and eventually I have been getting better. After that I started to go to the gym from Monday through Thursday every single week. It's not too late to start an activity at a younger age, but for an older age it could be. The people just got to work hard if they want to achieve their goal, but the only way they could do it is if they can believe that they can do this.

In addition, other people think that not doing any activity serves a purpose. They say that because they think their parents do most of the work so they don't have to do any of it. Also, there are people who are just lazy and don't care about their life. Others think that doing activities doesn't really achieve their goal in the future. Most people just don't know what they want to do in life.

Lastly, Thomas Jefferson doesn't want people to be idle for their whole life because he wants to help them do activities that they think its interesting. Another reason why people should take an advantage of this, so when they are young, they will understand of what is gonna happen in their future, and then as they get older, they will have full potential by doing it. Also, it will help them and other people get the job done. They will not have to struggle in their future. The thing about activities is to never give up, even if they mess up its ok, they just need to practice and practice nonstop.",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5

I am 18 years old I am the last of my three brothers Generic_Name,Generic_Name and, Generic_Name that have growth next to me and had gave me very fun and good moments.

I always was looking at him and, paying atention at everything he was doing to learn and memorize because I really enjoyed helping my dad.

Most of the student have reason that is to much break during summer break, but I am disagree with the idea of change the schedule of vacaction time. Could be during summer break the student forget some information of school, but all student wait for summer because much student like to travel to their country during vacation time, or some student only can see their family during summer break and their like to pass time with them, I guess is better time to take vacation in summer. Also the eductors need to think about the thing they can do during summer break because during winter the weather is really bad and also is too much snow and is too cool for to go out side.

Another reason that why is bad idea to get break during winter is because in winter the job is slow, and the center recreational are close like the pool, beach, park, and the fair. I think 3-4 week break during summer is a little be of time to have fun with the family, and enjoy their vacation I dont see the main point of the change because if they change the longer break for winter it take the same time because they also want that student take a week break durin spring and falls; Is more complicated if they change the schedule.

Therefore is a bad idea to change because it should be the same way it doesnt matter what time or what station is the break it should be the same way, because if they do in winter they going to forget information, eather is not good idea because the student cant enjoy their break for the weather.

It's important to understand that failure is not something bad its just something in the way of your success. These are my opinion on what i thing about. these paragraphs that you are about to look at have a mixer of things from hard working to failure just a little background of what you are about to read.

Starting a company can be really hard because there are a lot of failure that you'll have to go through to get to success. Because you won't be a big company from the start you have to built up to have a big company. For example the company apple it started in a garage and now its one of the biggest company to be know. Failure is just something that's in the way of you becoming successful. Because what it takes is hard work that you need to put into your company or whatever you are trying to be successful at. If not someone else that's trying to get the some thing as you will get it before you. Because you did not work hard enough

Becoming successful in something is a hard thing. Because of other people can be trying to do the same thing you are trying to do and sometimes not everyone is successful because of someone else that worked hard then them of the successes. Being the best at what you do is difficult because people are going to bring you down those are failure because they hate on your successes and what you have accomplished.

Working hard on something that you on you'll be successful in because if not other people that are on the same race as you trying to be successful are working more harder then you are going to be more successful because of the hard work they put in. If you are starting a company try to be the best at what you are doing because that's the only way you'll be successful because you are the best at what you are doing and no one else can't beat you to the top.

33F18D5D8867,"Would it be surprising to know that kids learning at home help then not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by students getting to much school work that cannot all handled in one night. Everyday kids complain about having to much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Allowing children to work on their own schedule helps them become more motivated to work. Students being educated at home gain more freedom to create their own schedule and their own rules. Learning at home and not at school helps kids to succeed and have better grades. No only does learning at home provide less distraction, it provides students with flexible schedule.

First, Students complain about having to much homework because students who spend a lot of time on their homework and don't have enough free time for them to relax is considered having to much homework. When they get out school and they have to practice some sports them they have to go to their house just to eat and them to do their homework, they cannot spend time with their family. Homework can limit the time. Students can spend with their friends, family, or other activities they can do. Too much homework can also give students more pressure from parents interference, this may cause unhealthy amount of stress. This is why students prefer home school.

Second, One of the best things about home school is that It can be done at anytime because It can be done at any time, children have a flexible time schedule with mean that the parents can helps. The student can work around schedule instead of the parent working around the students schedule. Some students have trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pace set by teachers. Home schools allow students to work at their own pace and on their own schedule. Another thing about homeschooling is that there are not rules about technology or how to dress. This is good because instead of worrying about the rules, the students can focus on their studies.

Third, when you are taking a test or taking notes at a public school there are may distraction that can make students loss focus on what there are doing. This is another reason that learning from home would benefit student. Learning from home won't have the distraction that that a classroom has. As a result of this, student won't loss focus on the work they are doing and get better grades. One of the reason students get distracted in the first place is because they are in an environment they are no familiar with, which makes then feel uncomfortable. If a student learns from home they will feel more relaxed and comfortable and won't stress about work. In a school, you are stuck at desk for 6 hours and have limit time to eat and limited bathroom breaks. This does not helps students at all. In conclusion, the environment at home will benefit student's by giving them better grades.

In conclusion, Students should be offered classes online because the environment is less stressful, which could benefit test scores. At home there is less distractions, rather than at school where are many different things to worry about. The flexibility of the time students are allowed to complete work would benefit the mental health and grades of the student. Many students successfully take some, and even all, classes from home. School systems and all districts should offer distance learning. ",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5
3438C0C5ACEA,"I oppose to extending the school day to one and a half minutes or ninety minutes. Students need to get back home sooner so they can practice their homework and do some of their own hobbies at their spare time. Schools must have an appropriate schedule so students can actually have time to work at home afterwards. The school board shouldn't extend the school day by adding one and a half hours because the students won't have time for themselves at home, the classes would take longer, and the school will end at evening time.

First off, students always want to get back home when school is over, but if the school extends the time, the students wouldn't have time to do their own activities at home. For instance, if one student comes home at 4:50 pm, and they finish their homework at 5:30 pm, then their parents would tell them to get ready for bed because kids have to sleep early at 8:00-9:00 so they can be ready for school the next day.

Secondly, classes would also have an extended amount of time in the daily schedule if the school day extended. Students will start complaining about the slowness of the class due to the start and end times of classes being changed. For example, the kids would be complaining over the lesson taking so long. Some students would also fall asleep during class too. Therefore, extended class times can affect how students will behav during class.

Lastly, the school will end at the evening time. Students would be feeling less energetic when school ends, and they won't be able to get home to do their homework because they're half asleep. When they get home from school, their parents will notice how tired and exhausted they are from what happened at school and the students will have to rest and sleep for the entire day. If the school extends the schedule, then the students' energy won't be enough for them when they return home from school.

In closing, extending school hours will affect the students' behavior and the time they have for themselves at home. The kids won't be able to do the fun stuff at their spare time after finishing their homework because they have to go to bed early for school. They'll also feel tired and complain about the length of the school time. When they return home, they'll groggily enter the house and end up resting for the rest of the day. Schools don't need to extend the day by adding one and a half hours to each day. They need to require a proper schedule so the students can behave properly during the day.",5.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,5.0,4.5

People can checkout books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person.

Has the limitation of human concact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people's lives?

Towards to technology, lack of communication is going to ruin our human sociaty.

Especially when phones are advancing in the next years.

One day, technology will take over the human population.

Say this, one day a boy meets this girl from school and they were talking through a social media,

but one day, they thought to meet up in person and when they saw each other, it was really awkward at first, but then they became very good friends. So they started to go to the movies, the mall, restuarants, and etc.

They started as two random strangers to having a, boyfriend and girlfriend relationship. Saying this to someone is really touching, because liking someone is to die for, but there's rules to follow and things to do and not just kissing or making love, its being there for them and hopefully you'll be there too.

Meeting that special person is a blessing, because for so long people have been trying to talk to this special someone,

but its really hard to confess it through person, but throught a screen is pretty easy, but do you really mean it?

Saying ""I love you"" means alot to someone, but actually saying it over and over again, it just warms my heart to say this, but i think im in love. Not just saying to make people to break through a screen, because saying ""i wanna break up"" it really just says you do not have the heart to say it to their face. Honestly everyone who does this, should just atleast try it and see what's more than life, then just being on the phone most of the day.

Once the day comes everyone will just destroy their own phone to prevent from robot abomination.

We sometimes help eachother with homework or needing someone to help study. We love to play football beacuse we are pushing our body to become stronger,healthy,body in check,and our mind out the gutter as in our mind roaming freely but thniking at the same time. Whenever I play left-mid I got to keep eye on my oppenent that is in front of me because who knows he might end up getting the ball passed to him and it's my job to stop him from going further then where he is because if he goes further it'll effect me because it's my job to make sure he doesn't reach the end zone or go further then the spot they were originally at. Football for me release any stress I have on my mind like I just release the stress and be focus more on the field the thing I was stressing about earlier because like for a person like me i stress a lot and think too much for my brain and my head ends up hurting because of too much stress,over thinking,things on my mind. Football is a very enjoyable sport to play.

I enjoy uploading songs and get paid cause it's one way of making money by the internet but at the same time it can be really hard sometimes becaus eyou have to think what song you're going to upload and make sure theres no mistakes in it very well audio quality.

In addition, people have already their own routine to work, even thought if some busines try to change work days.

To began,

people will not have time to share with their family, also working 4 day a week for 10 hours will cause problem in your family, children in those time do not have enough responsibility to be home by their self, even thought, people will not have time to do work at home. For example; to clean their house, to go work after school and to coexists their problems or thoughts with the family. And to do other works at the end of the day.

Second, working 10 hours a day they will use the same quantity of energy and resources because is the same sum of hours that all people work, if they work 8 hours a day for 5 day, even that people may use more energy, because the rest of the week people will need energy, as well to work 10 hours a day will use the same amount of resources, to make up all the works that you need to do.

Lastly, people will not support working 10 hours a day, because many people have their routine to work, or some of them have problems working to many hours, another reason why people can not work 10 hours a day is that they have their own routine work, as well student in school will not support to be in class. For example many student gets bored in class juts been 8 hours in school and if we compare there will be a lot if issue with their attendance. another point is many student work to support their self, so in that occation they will not available to work and make money.

To conclude, to work 10 hours a day is to hard for many people and they will try to work less hours in a day, because they can not have time to share with the family, also they can get sick for being working to many hours. even thought on this times some people worked 10 hours a day, but at the end of all that working to much can cause serious problems with your health.

An afterschool homework club would be nice to have because they get better grades, they could study more, and they could understand the subject better

First of all, they get better grades by helping each other on their homework and they can socialize to know more people, make new friends. Plus they can make up stuff they haven't done at all and have a zero in their grade.

Next, they could study more. Studying more could be a benefit because better test grades, better quiz grades, etc. Also they could get ahead on their classes by doing extra homework and normal work. If you never study you could start by considering to join this club. It could be loads of fun if you make it fun.

Some schools offers ways to a student to be prepared and go into their goals .

However, most of the students think that they are ready to reach their goals early instead of going 4 years high school because it makes more complex for a student who wants to finish high school and be prepared for the future. I consider saying , there are ways for them to get ready because students get jobs , start college early and get experience or success that can makes them a professional as quickly as they can .

For instance, start college early,

the student could learn more about their careers and get some ideas for what they look for .

Other reason is the students get jobs easily, makes them work for the future for not being the guy who works in restaurants and other stuffs with a low income .

Lastly , Be success in your life, that's why parents are so prouds of their childrens and taking care for a good path

Finally , I conclude saying that going 3 years high school is going be easiest to a student because the could learn more , get more experience and be successfull in their daily life , as much as they can , student provide more percentage of intelligence that can be more well known at a short period ",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.5
380164B1BAB5,"Some high school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. I think this is a bad Idea because students should be required to be in school eight hours everyday. Allowing these students to take online courses they lack teaching and intructions in a classroom, evening school is a poor idea, and elective courses should be required to boost their gpa. Letting students to have these options they might not enjoy school as they should.

In other words, I think students should and must be placed in a classroom. Take an example physical education and health is a required course for graduation. However, how can you allow a student to take a course like that online and expect he or she to learn. I am not saying it impossible; I think they should be taught. A course like this deserve to be in a gym somewhere so students can interact with one another. Also, most students do not comprehend well through a screen and this might affect their way of learning.

Also, I think evening school is a bad idea because students need that eight hour of sleep every night. Giving them these options it could lead to bigger problems. This could ruin he or she lifestyles because they have to be willing to get up at night to attend school. Abscences could rise up because the students could be tired. When they have this option parents might not be able to take them to school if they live far and this could lead to safety issues.

In conclusion, school districts should insist the traditional four years of high school. When they have an extra year, they could use it to boost their grades. Having elective courses could help the students dramatically. Most students tend to score low in one class then others. Letting students take elective courses it could boost their gpa. Students should be placed in a classroom with everybody else and it would give them the opportunity learn and interact with each other.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5

My school should not follow this model or even consider extending the school day by two hours. At my school a full day of school consists of seven hours. Seven hours is more then enough, Now having it to be nine hours would be very overwhelming for everybody. Extending it two more hours is too much stress on the students , as well as the teachers. Also most students have a part time job after school and won't fit everyone's schedule. There is a lot to do after school and extending school two more hours would not help. It also would not only affect the students but the teachers too. Some teachers have a second job to go to after school, Some teachers have children to go take care of at home. Also it is scientifically proven, That if students are in school for more than the seven hours they usually are in school, The students mind shut down. once the mind shuts down the body does too. So whenever the teacher is teaching the students isn't picking up the information and isnt learning anything. The student isnt focousing and also tired. So it would not benefit the students much , by adding the two hours. It will most likely have the students failing, because they're not leaning or doing their work.

I'm writing this letter to you because i think that is better to not allow students to have cell phones at school at all because they might get distract when they have their cell phones and they might use them during class. I think this is better because some students bring cell phones to school and they use them during class and they don't pay attention to the teacher and they are always distract when they have cell phones, some students don't pay attention because they are using cell phones in class and when the teacher ask them a question they don't know what to answer because they didn't pay attention when the teacher was talking. Another thing is that some students are now getting in trouble because they are using cell phones talking to other people that they don't really know and they give that person information about them and about school and they don't really know who that person is and they could be in danger because that person knows everything about them and about the school.

Sometimes students have their cell phones turn on during class and when the teacher is talking the phone begins to sound like someone calling or a message and they interrupted the teacher and the teacher have to take time from the lesson and tell the student to turn on the cell phone or to give it to her.

Studies have shown that one way to improve student achievement is to start an afterschool homework club. I'm gonna agree with this idea because it's a helpful club for all the students , and it can make a big different in our grades! I can tell you the purpose and the reasons why did i agree with this idea!

In order to be proud and gain many students' achievement, you would like to have some extra help to improve your learning memorize. In my school, i can see there're already students that did a wonderful job, but the president, teachers, would like to have some more to be proud about their school. According to that, afterschool homework club could be a good way to make it came true. Also, participate in this club can help you understand a learning target more clearly. Why don't you agree and try?

Teachers and students volunteer to meet with those who need help either in homework or extra help in certain subjects. Example, an important test that could include stuff from last year or stuff that're hard to understand, an afterschool homework club can help you out with teachers and students! In an afterschool homework club, you would feel more comfortable than in class. Because you can talk about many subjects, have fun with your friends, feel free to start a conversation about ideas or topics. It's extremely entrusting. You can also ask for a common study guide for the whole club and we can all solve together to increase teamwork skills. Then we can help each others on what they get stuck, and we will get their help back! This is another way to improve your learning memorize in an afterschool homework club.

Gaining some achievements, improve your grades, be proud of yourself, afterschool homework club can help you. It may sound very simple, but it can effect your learning a lot! That's the reasons why i said that i agree with the idea to set up this club. I would like my school to start to establish afterschool homework club. Would you agree or disagree?

3A38B9DD6723,"In every success of a person there is always a humble story of how did they start from the beginning of their journey. At some point, being successful does not mean you have gone through a lot of struggles, but it was destined for you to be successful. In every story there are different types of story because it is based on where you came from, what education you have finished, and your status in life.

However, I agree with Churchill's statement because success comes after failure. Failure is really an important role for every success. If I fail, I did not hesitate to stand back for myself to pursue success. The greatest blessing in my life is being successful after I have gone through failures. For instances, Graduating high school, I won't be graduating if I did not fail and try harder to reach my goal. At some point of my life, failure is within me because I am not making any move to pursue my planned success. Planning ahead of my success is not bad actually it prepares me to become a successful individual, if I will fail at this time maybe planning my success is not a good idea because it was planned and I know what kind of success is waiting for me. I'd rather be a failure with clean conscience than a successful cheater.

I conclude that in every success of a person is within you. You hold your own fate. If success is really for you be thankful of what kind of success you are receiving at that moment of your life.

First of all, it is easier to search information. It became to help to students and teachers too, because, it is easier for students to search different information form different topics or classes. Also, the teachers can send information or assignment to the students and they can check it at the moment.

Consequently, they can save time. They can use many tools that help to do easy the work. use the Google translate it is one of the tools more important for some students that the English is their second language, because, it is fast to search the wolds on it.

Third reason, it is useful manage a different social media to be informed in some areas. The students can share information about the different programs, event or sports game that they have in the school. furthermore, it is a manner to keep them involved in the different events at that schools.

Nothing really is the way it seems to be. When it comes to first impression its always important to act a certain way. Everything changes , people change, things change eventually.

When it comes to first impression people always change. Sometimes when you meet someone they always want to seem kind to the other person for them not to think anything bad of them but good. When you go into a job interview you want to dress appropriately, you also want to act appropriate, and respectful with the other person when that may be out of your comfort zone. Some people can change in a relationship they act all sweet at first but then one day they'll just switch up on you and act different and be different from when they first met the person. Most of the times thats always the case people just act different from what they got in their first impression.

Nothing seems like the way it should be. Meeting people is nice but from what you can gather from the first impression is not always enough. I've met people who have thought i was mean because of the way I looked that was their first impression on me but then they said when they started to actually have a conversation with me and actually talked with me they realized that I was really nice and not mean. Thats the thing about the first impression it always changes. People can look at certain way but act completely different. I like to dye my hair different colors some people find that intimidating because of how I look but i'm a nice person I love to meet people and talk but it may not look like I do.

Meeting people is an important thing in life. Everyone is always meeting people which means first impressions matter. When you meet someone you dont want them to hate you, you want them you like you. You have to act nice and polite even if you are not in the mood to be nice or even if you're the meanest person you have to be respectful with others around you. You change the way you are most people do it and dont realize that they do change from when they first were with the other person. I've met friends who i thought would do good for me in my life because of my first impression with them but turned out to be toxic and bad for me.

I already learned during the year, in others words students need to work in their on projects during their break

The firs reason about this topic, some students, who feel more comfortable making their on projects is that they will know how the topic goes, because they were the ones who created. in fact, If schools let students to make their own projects , they will be more comfortable because they will know what the topic is about and it will be easy for them to make it.

Some people believe that technology saves your time as you can buy or sell things online. However, so much use of technology effect your eyes and brain in a negative way.

Therefore, usage of technology should be made less and people should interact with each other more, because the more friends you will have the less you will go in the depression.

Use of technology have a lot of negative effects on people's lives. Too much use of technology weakens your communication skills with other people. Recently it has been said that there are some kind of radiations on your phone and other electronics which affects your brain and body in a negative way. Too much use of phones, laptops and television can weak your eye sight making it difficult for you to see.

Some people say that technology can be used for different kind of resources . On the other hand, it can also leads you towards the cyber crime which is really bad for you, because if you are caught once doing that crime the rest of your life you will be in jail.

Now a days, if you will go outside, in many places you will see that there will be friends or family sitting on the same table but no one is talking with each other, everyone is on their devices.

There are many people in today's world who do suicide or are in depression just because they think they have no one to whom they can talk and can share their problems.

For example, if there is some one is trying to talk to you and is trying to be your friend but you are busy in using your phone and the next day you came to know that the person who was trying to talk with you yesterday did suicide today because that person thought that he had no one to whom he can talk. So you will blame yourself and you will regret at that time for not talking with that person.

Hence, people should interact with each other more and more and they should try to know about each other life intead of using their devices all the time. People should spend more time with their families because not everything is found on Google,there are somethings which you learn by spending time with your family and your family will be the only one who will be with you every time, in your good and bad days, but your devices will not be with you and also they will not support you at that time.

3CED6DDF77BE,"School districts should not offer programes that allow high school students to gradutade in three years instead of the traditional four years because elective courses are important as well as academic courses, the summer courses are expensive and parents should let the children to enjoy the summer.

Elective courses are important besides the academic courses. A student should collect the other knowledges also. Only academic courses are not gonna help him/her to be a good human being. Afterall, he/she has some hobbies in his/her life like cooking, painting, designes, dancing, singing. Think, a student is only studying because he/she wants to graduate earlier than the traditional four years. What will happen next? At the point he/she will be tired of life which is absolutely unfair. Maybe she/he has a very good artist. How can he/she expose? The answer is through electives. No matter what a person works with, if he/she doesn't like to do that work, it never last longer. So, elective is a way to make student happy and cheerful. When the academics make them tired, electives help them to get out from there.

Summer courses are expensive in some of the schools. Sometimes middle class family can't afford the courses fees. For this, the rich kids take the courses only. The poor kids stay behind. The poor kids can't afford the courses just because of money. Maybe they are more talented than the rich kids. They also should get that opportunity. Isn't it unfair for the poor students? Yes, it is. So, they shoudn't continue with this three years method. We should treat all the students equally.

Students should enjoy the whole summer by doing outside activities. Students usually have school 9am to 5pm. They spend their whole time in the school. How can they make themselves involve with outside world? Normally they can't in the regular school days. For this, governments make this rule to free the studnets in the summer so that they can enjoy outside activities. If they think about the summer courses, it's not possible to enjoy their summer honestly. A student leads a robotic life in usual school days. For mental health a person needs some free time or vacation. It's absolutely not possible for a person to lead a regular life everyday. Entertainment is important. A routined life, 9am to 5pm then returns to home, again homework. Life can not run like this. I understand that every parents want their child to be smarter than others. But it doesn't mean that they just have only one way to prove themselves by taking the summer course and entering college earlier. They can be a good artist or journalist. The parents should think about the children also. Not only about their academic abilty. There is a record in the United States that students attemp suicide because of study pressure. Isn't it shame for a country? A student is attempting suicide. why?

because he/she can't handle the pressure. Without life, what will you do with the education? Mental peace is important. So, for mental health a student has to enjoy the summer.

We have only one life to enjoy. Let's not waste it by thinking about academic career only. We have much things to do as well as academic. Just need to keep patience and walk with the flow. Life is beautiful.     ",4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.0
3D3C80EF2AAA,"""It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to Chang"" i agree with this quot, for three reasons.

First, when you meet someone and you see how they act you get those feelings about them if it was hate or love. Second, you may never meet that person agean, so the way he act this one time is gong to make you judge them. Third, or even if you see them every day the way they act toured you give you thats feelings that never will Chang toured them or your impressions. Finally,that why you cant Chang your first impressions.

Those feelings that you get turd that person, if it was love or hate is because of the way they act.

For example this one time i met someone and it was my first time meeting him so i did not know what to expect from him. After talking to him i did not like the way he talk or his personality so my impressions for him was not good and i never Chang the idea that i took of him. I never met that person aegean in my life. Thats why when you take that look at someone you never chang your mind.

3DB503D247B3,"Dear, Teacher

What do I think about working with people or working alone, I think both have great benefits but it depends on the type of person if they are social, antisocial , or if they been through stuff. But if I was to pick one I would choose to work with a group because of how many advantages their are, if your stuck and you need help you can always ask for help from your group because theres more than one, working with your group is easier than working alone because you can do different parts at the same time meanwhile when you work alone it takes longer, it becomes more difficult if you need help and not knowing what to do. Working together gives us a bigger boost of an IQ because multiple brains are better then one and gives us a better over all grade or if the person that is working alone and is very smart he could find things easier. Working together could be fun because of the people you are working with or meeting new people in the group that you don't know and learning from them and what experience they been through.

Disadvantages are people are going to force the smarter person of the group to do all the work, if people choose the group they'll choose either the smart people of people that they get along with and mess around and not do anything, if the teacher finds out that the smart ones from the groups do all the work they'll get an f. People who choose people to be in their groups are going to abuse their power. People who choosed to work alone would be struggling because work hard and they would have to do all the work, it would be boring and long with no one to socialize, if were stuck you and you needed help no one is there to help.

3DE204C5895E,"Businesses have adopt a four day work week with each day consisting a ten hour shift to conserve energy and resources. Schools are considering to follow this model. Although a four day school week is what every students want, I disagree schools should have to extended two hour more for a four day school week because it leaves student less time to do school work and sports activities through out the day and it will ruin there sleep schedule.

Schools should have to extended two hour more for a four day school week. It will leave less time for students to do there school work and sports activities through out the day. Student would normally leave school around three in the afternoon. If schools extended two hour more from the normal time they'll leave around five in the evening leaving them less time less for homework. Kids that have after school sports, have games and practice for two hour. The kids would've come straight to do there homework and other things.

Schools should not have a four day school week. It will ruin students sleeping schedule. If students are still up late trying to finish there homework, are getting less sleep. Students that have after school sports would stay up later to finish up things they haven't finished. The students that come to school tired always gets less sleep. If a student have a test the nest day and stay up studying, they will come to school too tired to take the test.

Others may say having a four day school week would be great. It will be less stressful for students. Students won't have to worry about school as much and it will leave them more time to do homework on the days off. However, I still believe that having longer hour for school is not healthy for the students. Schools shouldn't have to extended two hour more for a four day school week because it leaves student less time to do school work and sports activities through out the day and it will ruin there sleep schedule.

3E9A664FFD33,"Although some say true self-esteem comes from praise of others because make people feel more comfortable with their life, actually it comes from achievements. Self achievements make people decide for themselves and teaches confidence.

Most people think that with praising students, they may be motivating the student to become a better version of them selves, and that the students might be developing confidence through small amount of work. Some also say, that is important to give credit to students work. No matter how bad it's.

People who decide for them selves, are most likely to get a high pay job; than someone who was used to being praised while was a student. It had been proved. kids who grow up in environments where their parents, teachers and peers, are happy with his/her academic skills without making them improve. Will be hard for them to get a high pay job in the future unless they have a special talent.

True self-esteem comes from achievements and confidence. For example; 3 years ago I start training mix martial arts; I was also living in a environment where people used to praise me. Which is not a bad thing, but I perfectly new that, that won't do any good on my future. I remember that before training MMA, I didn't have self-esteem neither confidence. Once I join the MMA academy coaches used to tell me, and still telling me ""that technique is not good enough, that take down sucks"". My coaches didn't praised me. My coaches taught me; what I needed in order to achieve confidence in battle or in anything I want to do in life.

Image a world where people listen to the rest, and don't try to make decisions for their own. It wouldn't make anyone for good, unless they are the kind of people, who need someone to depend on. For example; when my father was young he made decisions for his own. nobody praised for him. he developed a very powerful skill. He developed confidence. The confidence brought him to USA and had the opportunity to get a high pay job.

In conclusion I strongly believe students shouldn't be praise. I believe that praising students do good while they are young, but when they get older; they will want to have this feeling of relying on someone, and have more chances of ending up in low paying and boring jobs.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0
3F1ED9A56002,"The one thing students shouldn't have are phones. Why?

It is because students in different country always use their phones for my reason

The first reason why students shouldn't have a phone because of social media. What is social media that you might be asking? Well social media is where people can comment on pictures or video. The one that i should add to that is that students everyday will always go on their phone and posted a picture or a video of them self or with someone.

The second reason why students shouldn't phones because they might have download something that could get them hacked or giving information to someone that they don't know on the internet. The third reason why students should have phones because sometimes people can get bullied on the internet which the term is called cyberbullying. What is cyberbullying that you might be asking? Cyberbully is another form of bullying, but it is on the internet. The third reason why students shouldn't have a phone because some students will sometimes look on their phone without looking at where they are going. Some students got them killed because of that reason. So I suggest to not use your phone while you are walking across the street. The fifth reason why students shouldn't have a phone because of you posting a picture of you in a different country. Well that is risk because you could get robbed. How do you even get robbed first of all that you might be asking? Well you post a picture of you in a different country and that is giving the robs more of a chance to rob your house. The sixth reason why students shouldn't have a phone because they might prank call some local fast food restaurant. If you prank call the police, you will get yourself in trouble for that reason which many people in different country prank call the police for funny reason and also bad reason. The seventh reason why students shouldn't have a phone because it could explode because you are using all the time. If you are using it none stop, then it will explode on you so I suggest that you should use it for 2 hours or so. The last reason why students shouldn't have a phone because of how addicting it is to everyone.

That is the reason why students shouldn't have a phone",2.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5
3F20E4B1AA0D,"Should students have longers breaks during the school years? i have lestening to all the parents at school saying that students should get more longers breaks during the school year but i am totally desagree because, it is not a good idea having really longers breaks during the entire school year .Some students dont have the ability to learn easily than the others and if we get more longers breaks then we will not have time to teach those students who really needs help in school and it is not that the school is like trying to be mean to the students it is just that we think that if we give more education to the students then they will have a better future in their lifes.

First of all we all know that having breaks sounds reallly fun but sometimes we need to think about our future, in specific when we want to live a good life or have a better future and i think having breaks all the time it is not that necessary. For example, if someone is going to vacations, breaks and traveling around the world all the time, they probably dont know that is going on in the present or what are the news of the day , they are not being educate but in this case we are talking about the students so i think if students have really logers breaks all the time they are not going to be educate when they grow up , they are not going to do things by them self because they are not going to know how to do something .

second of all, giving breaks to the students all the time its is not good because, they are not going to have a good behavior in their future, some teachers works really hard to teach those students who dosen't have the ability to learn like others and when they going to vacations or breaks , all the hard work that the teachers were giving to the students will be gone because, they will not been focusing in school or they will not being focusing in what they were learning about. Also when students go to vacations or breaks they only think about having a great time with friends or family and i know that their are some others kids or students that sometimes are not like those students who dont really care about their future and i honestly think that if all the students could be educate individually will be a really good idea .

Finally, i think that the parents really need to know how important is to being educate when u are young because , when a person stars growing up everything in your mind change too. As adult i can say that it is hard to learn things when u get older. Sometimes when you get old, you star getting more lazy but when you are young it gets easy because , the only thing you have to do is study and focusing on school so that is why i think being educate is really important for a human and it is not good to be wasting time in longers breaks or vacations when we can waste all that time doing proyects, homework and activitides in school, and if the students have longers breaks then they will forget the knowledge during the breaks .

As a result , i think having longers breaks it not that really necessery for students specially when they are young because, a student dont really need that much time to relaxing or that much time to have a free time doing nothing . Also i can say that a student dont need a really a long break because, when i was in high school the only thing that i needed to be focusing on was in school becuse i wanted to have education, i wanted to have a better life and be a good person in the future. I also think that when you are educate you have more opportunity to get a job. For example , if you are not educate and you want to apply to get a job, the manager it is going to see that you are not educate enough to be working in the place ,so you absolully not going to have a chance to get a job. And i think that is really important for getting a job in whatever place you want to work in, so i really think that the students should not have longers breaks during the school year , that way students will be more polite in school and they will be focussing in learning more things that is going to take them to a better place ,to a better life and to a better future.",2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5

In this life nothing comes easy, you have to work harder to build something or what you have in mind, once you build what you got in your mind you still probbably not going to stop trying to build more than what you already have, because you already tasted hows it feel having much, so you keep going and build more and more only because you don't feel that what you got is enougth or you liked how is feel having much.

408A7D3D2EEC,"Imagine seeking advice from multiple people and choosing the best decision that suits you. How does that make you feel? Asking for advice can be defined as someone who asks help from multiple people and makes the right decision. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better decision because they can see which advice is better, more experienced, and see the persons point of view.

Asking advice from multiple people can help you see which advice is better. Let's say this person needs to ask their teacher what book to choose. But, they also asked their friends the same question. They can now see which decision is better for them. It also depends if the advice is decent or not because if the advice is horrible, then that decision you make can affect the outcome.

Another way asking advice from multiple people can help you is they might have more experience. For instance, they need help picking a collage that suits their interest. When they ask their parents for advice, the parent might pick a different collage that could be better. But, that's because they have more experience and can see whats best for them. Grandparents especially, went through a lot when they were kids. So, if you need advice, ask adults who are more experienced in life!

Lastly, asking advice from multiple people can help you see the persons point of view. For example, they can see what other people have to say and can help you make that better decision. Let's say they need help painting their house but dont know what paint color to choose. But, when they ask someone for advice, they can see what the other person has to say and make the right decision based on that advice.

In conclusion, asking advice can help someone make a better decision because they can see the persons point of view, more experienced, and they can see which advice is better. Asking for advice is important because they can see which advice is better and can see other peoples perspective. This affects you because its on you to ask for advice and make the right decision!",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0

I would like to visit your companies to explore if the crear is good encore for me.

If I like what is available for to do.

I want to know more and see how it needs to be done.

The companies is big that you can have a lot of employees to do work faster. The students can see how it feels to work or to be in a companies. You can make the student know how it feels to be a manager and to work up to 7 hours. You can tell them how long they will work and when there lunch at when it is time. You can show how it is all organized and where everything is at to get anything fast when it is need for the product to be done in order to sell it to the people.

People will wonder how the companies work and it could be tiring if at night.

How big can a companies even be are there any limit to the area going to be used for the company.

What is the cost for a companies for it to be build. Dose a companies have to be remolded and cert en times like every 5 to 6 years. Where can a companies be build at in urban places are rural places. When do people come to bring stuff to make something to sell it because they will need stuff to make the thing to sell it and get money to invest to the company so it will grow. What is the cost for all the meltarsils of the company to be able to run correctly so not a lot of money is put in to it and get broke and struggle with money that is needed.

Going to a company can help others if they want to work in a company.

Some people want to see how it feels to work or be a manager and time to put in to work.

What will a company do if they run out of money and supplies dose the company need to be sold.

Will a company pay lots of money for the bills from most of the elctristy. will a company get in to trouble if the supplies they make is not good? All companies are big but some are bigger than other because they sell there stuff faster and get more money from it and they get better stuff to use and make there company even bigger with better stuff to make the supplies and surly more employees. every company makes there own stuff they can't tack other people supplies and take the credit of the managers.

What wll happen if on company steals an idea form someone will they get a fine of a lot of money are they will go to jail for stealing the idea of the other company.

Will all companies have work all the time.

Do companies work on festive days like Christmas or new years.

Will employees get some days to have vacation.

After all the work is done all the machine get turned off if in a festive day.

When a employ gets sick do they have to call the manager to say they can't go or they just don't go and wait if the manager calls him because he wasen't there.

If they get sick during work will replacement person come to replace them for the days or in tell they feel better.

When there is a fire will they get money from all the thing they got destroyed or that don't work any more.

It will be nice if students can go to the companies and see how it is like to be a manger or employ or even a expert so the can control the money so they don't get broke in the future of the company.

Know everyone will know how it feels to be a manager or employ of any job that needs the manager or employs.

All of the these will help and see how it feel to control the company and how they do it and when get sick while in work.

40DB9B4FC90A,"Our good behavior is something the motivate us as a way of thinking or, feeling as one on self to be someone important in our life. Because, it described us by having a good conduct, a positive personality, and a attitude. This is something the help us to have a good success in life. Because if we want to do something in our life we always need to be positive.

My first reason is having a good conduct it help us to be a better person, every where we go. Because, is going to be useful

For example: If the students go to the school every day; they have to behave with the teachers. They need to be respectful with them. We must do everything that they say because, we are smarter people to understand what is good and bad for us.

My second reason is a positive personality is also important. It help us to be more successful. For example: If we are taking a test; we always need to be positive instead of being negative or, if we have bad grades we can asked the teacher to help us. We must do our home works, and extra works so we can improved our grades.

My third reason is a good attitude is also important because it described who we are. For example: I helped my friend friend to find a new job were I work. So, she got a interview for the job. I told her to have a good attitude so they will might accept her were I work. I think is important to help others.

We always need to have a good attitude so we can be someone in our life. Because, we are smarter people, and we know what is important for us. Also is going to help us to be successful in life. We most be positive and do what is important to us. ",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5
41641B53F554,"I am writing to support the idea that students have to choose or identify a caree beafore they enter high school.

First of all, I support the idea on students choosing a career before they get to start high school.

That wey they will know, what they like to be when they graduate from high school.

For example some students will became profetional sport players, architects, doctors, etc.

Because thinking on becaming some one very important in the society at a young age will make them proud of them selfs, and that woul lead them in to a succesifull pat.

Secondly, for young students will be easier to get to where they want at a youn age.

Because they are young, they don't have to think a bout anyting ells but studying.

For example they don't have to think a bout payin bills, or taking care of the family.

The only thing they have to worry a bout is studying, and follow their dreams to be what they want to be.

In conclution, this are my reasons on why I support the idea that the student need to identify a career by the time they enter high school.

Thank you for your time and attention.

some day of this week my friend bring a pants and i'm saw him, my fist empression was ''naa this not going which you , so i will honest with him , if somebody tell me something that is not pleasing for me i'm sure that i going to put my impression face , and maybe the other person don't like, but it's impossible to change my impression , I will direct which the people ,if the people don`t like my impression i'm sorry for them, yeah maybe it's not correct to say the fist impression , i'm agree for that too, and i understand that some people put angry when i do that , but i can't change my actituded because i'm like this, it's the same with the another people they got them own impression but in different ways , that's fot that i'm agree , and i understand that is so important to me beacuse i don't know if the other person feel bad when i say the first impression , that's why i need to improve my impression , some people and my friends are annoying with me for this , and that's why i need to practice respect to myself and the another people.

The fist impression is bad idea because if i'm in the job and my boss tell me that my work is not like this, and i say my fist impression that's sure that my boss will put annying because maybe he try to teach me, and the fist thing that i do is my impression and is not a good imprression,

the impression can used in different ways, can use in possitive and negative forms so we decide what kind of impression to used , but a lot a time we only used a negative impression in that is not correct , for example if i or some friend bring something or do something we need to do an possitive impression but we always give a negative impression and that is not correct we need to encourage this person but we only do negative things.

I think this way because the older students can help with the subjects of the younger student that dose not know about. And that the older student can learn something about the younger student that he/she does not know about ether. To have more understanding of the old and young student. And to work together as one.

The older students have know the past year before the young. They know about the subjects they did and know what to do. This can help the young because when it comes to questions, they can do something about it. They can give examples of what troubles them when it comes to a hard question. To show what feels how hard or easy in class, projects, work, and homework can be.

The younger students has a fresh start to 5th grade to middle school or 8th to freshmen. Other students think that middle or high will be easy. Or other think that it will be hard for them self. To open up lockers, find there classes, etc. But by the older students can help them what works best for the student. They can understand of what to do in class. Because of the help of the older students. And they can also teach the other young students of the teaching of the older students.

The program can help each other by if they want to be helpful and to work the path to be more easier Maybe something won't be east on work in school.

First, If a student does cheat they could get in big trouble. One, they could get a zero on the test, and a zero on a test will lower the students grade. Second, the student could get sent to the principals' office and could get a call home. The students parents will also be upset. They would be in trouble at home and at school.

Second, If a student cheats on a proficiency test, it shows the teacher that the student doesn't know the material. For example, at the end of Spanish 1 you have to take a proficiency test. If the person you cheated off of doesn't know then, you fail and have to retake Spanish 1 again. For elementary it could be a spelling test. If they fail the spelling test they could also get a bad grade.

Last, the student could loose their teachers trust. The teacher would never let them seat next to a student during a test. Teachers trust is hard to gain back when you loose it. The students teacher will always keep their eye on the student that cheated. Those are the three good reasons why my lesson to the elementary students is important.",4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5
4351657CEC2F,"Do I agree with churchill""s statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? In my opinion I do agree with his statement because everyone fails at something in life. There's so many people that fail in the world and I definetly agree with churchill's statement because i think it really says a lot about life in general its not easy.

One reason is because I believe that everyone goes through some type of failure in life and I feel like that's the only way you learn from anything. I also think that people that fail are people that succeed at what they failed at. That's the only way you learn from anything for example people can fail at taking a test or playing a sport. Not everything people do the first means there gonna succeed which isn't always the case. I feel like when people fail that's when they can take the time and realize why they failed they learn from that mistake and the next time a oppurtunity comes for them to try again they can try there best and succeed. Trying your hardest is the best way to deal with a lot of things that's the only way to succeed in your best way.

Another reason I agree with this statement is because life isnt easy there are a lot of challenges your gonna come upon and all you have to do is try and if you fail the first time then there's always gonna be another oppurtunity around the corner. What I think churchill is trying to get at people is never give up and he's trying to say that it's okay if you fail the first time you try something there's always gonna be another chance to prove yourself and you can succeed at that goal or test you have in school or something like that. Iv'e failed many times in my life and on the second try i succeeded so churchill has a point when he says that it's okay to fail in life because thta failure prepares you to be better than you were the last time.

That is why I agree with this statement because i believe tha everyone deserves a second chance to prove themselves and what they are campable of. Churchill's statement should really speak to people and people should take it into consideration because there's always a time in life when you are going to fail and you are going to get a second chance at it again. I do completly agree with this statement because it makes you look at life and everything differently and in a better way that is why i agree with Winston Churchill.   ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0
442CFAE61CC3,"So we heard that our principal is going to let all the students to participate in one activity of their choice. But I have both reasons that might go alright or not. Lets just say if I agree or disagree with the principal decision and hopefully that our principal has a good feeling about this decision.

Lets start with a positive reasons. First responsibility, if the students get a activity that takes a lot of serious responsibility like for example serve on the student council or working on the yearbook, activity like that those have real responsibility to take care of. Next is not knowing it was the students talent, all activity will fill up very quickly and if any teacher puts a student that is not their favorite class they will notice that their very talented on a activity that they didn't like. Last positive reason overwhelmed, the student will get overwhelmed and sometimes is alright but at the end they still love the class.

Second, start with the negative reasons. It won't be their favorite if a student want to be a class so bad but then a teacher decides to put him/her to different class it's likely that the student wont be liking the class not a bit. Overwhelming, it's going to the same thing but the opposite its almost the same topic as the last reason of not liking the class and overwhelmed is the part cause of not liking the class which lead to our third last negative reason, dropping out its most likely that they gonna drop out the class it will get so stress and overwhelmed that the student decides to quit and that lead to have a no responsiblilty in life.

So I do agree with principal student or people need to have responsibility in life and without it theres going to be no job for that person who decided to drop of the activity they got asigned.  ",4.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5

first when I had 19 years old and I was in United States for seven years ago, In my brain had the idea the to be a Citizenship for United States of America when i'm twenty one years i'm doing the quiz, is good idea to be Citizenship for two countries. When the day come down i was so nervous because i was like what happen if i'm not pass i was in negative but my families told you need to be in positive. you do it and to being positive and pass 1 hour later and the people who had my test he told you pass the test i was like i can't believe and my familie of outside i said to them i pass and they tell me i told you you need to be positive in the things you want. Because if you do with bad mood you does't understand. Because when you have the opportunity and realistic you do it and be positive. even though need to be positive because negative is not good for the live.

second realist, when i was in the school in mexico i want to play soccer because my both brothers likes to play soccer and me too so my brother ask to me a question you want to play soccer in your school and i was like yes y want it , so my brother wont to see in the school how can i play soccer and he's do the paper for the school and two weeks later i go for the first time to coach i was exciting, and three months for practice, and then for the last three months we had the first game and i was make a goal and for the third game some girls hit me with a ball and when i was running i had bill my leg i i go the the hospital and the doctor told i can't play more because my leg was so bad if i had other bill probably my leg go so bad and the doctor and my familie does't want to play more but my old brother give me to the specialist doctor for my leg because i was so sad for not play and does's like how i'm looks like , so for one years for treatment now i can't play.

44D6EEDAE5BD,"Most people will just act all childish just because they are having a bad day without even thinking that it can ruin their future. Bad impressions usually lead to failure, it can ruin opportunities, and people can also get themselves mistaken. I agree that someone's first impressions are almost impossible to change because it can affect their future.

Firstly to begin with, first impressions usually lead to failure in life when they are bad impressions. People need to learn how to act politely even if they are full of sorrow inside without showing it. When people make bad impressions about themselves, it always makes it harder for other people to see who that person really is. Loosing big opportunities always lead to a challenging future.

Secondly another, bad impressions always ruin many opportunities for people, especially young people. It is an every day thing in the United States. People can loose job opportunities and it makes it harder for them to get a second chance. Second chances are really big deal, no one can live without them. If someone did some awful things and did not get another chance, then that person just lost an opportunity of a lifetime and is going to regret it for the rest of his or her life.

Also, people get themselves mistaken all the time because of that. Other people will never see that person for who he or she really is when that person is acting in an unusual way which is not normal. They will look at that person as he introduced himself as. They would not want nothing to do with him. They would also think that he is mean even if he is just having a bad day.

In conclusion, no one should let problems make them show a bad impression about themselves. Everyone has problems. They just need to learn how to control themselves and not make any scenes about it to embarrass themselves. They should know that the consequences are real and they are not games. People need to grow up, be responsible, act fairly, and be happy.  ",3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
451321E506A6,"I think students doing home assignments will not benefit the student, because it doesn't help the student grasp the same kind of concepts like other students that do go to school.

The reason why I personally don't like home schooling is because if I'm at home I wouldn't get my work done. I'd be distracted by looking at my dog and looking at what my mom would be doing. Another reason why I would not like it is because I'm not getting the same kind of education like most of the other students. I wouldn't have the chance to learn with my classmates or go on trips to historical monuments and historical musuems with them. When you're home schooled you're mostly self-taught.

One other reason why I wouldn't reccommend home schooling is because you're not interacting with other students which can cause depression and anxiety. Another reason why home schooling is not such a great idea is because when he learns how to write and read and play a musical instrument and masters soccer, running, or other sports in general how will this particular student learn how to communicate to the real world if the parent has kind of isolated him from meeting people. One of the other reasons why home schooling is bad is because the fact that parents may lose patience when they are trying to educate their children. Some parent may be too overbearing or impatient, which may cause the child to react in a negative manner.

I think home schooling is a bad idea is because he wouldn't get the proper education like most students in school. That could possibly effect the student and also that student is not interacting with other students which could lead to depression and axiety. If the parent loses their patience the child would start to act up on them. For all of these reasons home schooling is not a good idea. ",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

Even though some people disagree, I agree with Emerson's statement. The world that we live in has always been cruel and it will always be.

Growing up in life you will see a lot of people trying to bring you down, do the wrong things and take the wrong path, it is your job to make the right decisions. For example, friends will invite you to do wrong things such as doing drugs, something you are not suppose to do, it will only get you addicted, poor, homeless or all of these combined. They will ask you if you want to try it and they will tell you that it is just for fun and that you will like it, don't listen.

You will see people trying to make you do other bad things,even worse then doing drugs, such as stealing from other people,

beating somebody up or even killing someone. Be yourself and don't listen to those type of people. Stealing, beating or killing is illegal acts and it will only get you in jail or even maybe killed.

Another reason why I

Don't try doing crazy things just to fit in because someone told you to do it, be yourself, be happy, and people will like you the way you are, they will accept you the way you are, even with all your problems.

Forget about what the world wants you to be and focus on yourself so you can be whatever you want to be. Life is too short for people to tell you how to live your life, you only get to live once, it should be your right to live right.

In these days people are giving up on things that they might can do it, but they do not believe in themselves, going from failure to failure it does not mean to give up without trying. To be success, you must have to think positive and try it as many times as possible or as needed.

The pursuit of success is a key to be someone in life. However, each individual has their own thoughts or opinions. Unfortunately people loss their enthusiasm that takes them to never be successful. For example, many people play sports; they do not always win. They have failures. Sometimes they win, sometime they loose. Having those failures makes them to keep practicing, learn from the mistakes they made and try to fix them. It is a important role that later on in other games will help them to win. Deciding to give up will help them to be successful in many things in the future.

I had have many failures in my life. One of them is when I started to play the piano. I was twelve years old when I started. There was a time when I felt to give up because it was hard to play it, but I never loss my enthusiasm, I kept practicing untill I learned it. Having this failure make me think that if I never try, then I will never be able to success in life and neither to accomplish things in my own. Another thing, people had told me that I would not be a successful person because I have a son, who is only five months, my answer has been that I know it will be difficult to success, but not matters I will never give up untill I have achive my goals. Believing in myself is a thing that have help me to success.

In conclusion, success is a word that everyone should think with positive. Having a positive attitude will also help to be success.

First of all, students stay after school or ask for a raise pass to study more about the subject they have a test or quiz.

In the actuality, there is a lot of schools from South America like Peru, Chile, Bolivia, etc. that do not have after school or raise pass for students to study more. Some students have to pay approximate 30 dollars per hour for a personal teacher to help them at home. Students from South America do not have the facility to study with their teachers without paying for extra classes. Another example, when I came to United States, there was a day that I had an important test, and I did not know nothing about the topic. So, I stayed after school with my teacher, and we practiced a lot. When I took the test, I answered all the questions without problem. The next day, my teacher gave me back the test and I was the highest grade of the class. That made me stayed more often at school with my teachers to study different classes. Furthermore, to get good grades, students have to do homework, projects, and participate a lot in class.

Secondly, it is important for people that want to get better at sports to practice everyday to become an excellent player.

Additionally, people success in sports, when they never give up and try to learn by their mistakes. When I was in Generic_City, at school I was part of a volleyball team, and we played against another school. That day, I was not ready to play with the other school. My team lost the game because I did not played good. I did not want to play anymore, because I was scared of losing again. But I did not give up because I was fascinated with this sport and

I kept practicing and becoming better at volleyball.

I know that the best way to success at sports is practicing all the time, and never give up in something that you love. I learned that if I stayed in inactivity, and do not practice, I would never become a good player in volleyball.

Finally, people accomplish at work when they do new projects to grow the company each day. Another reason is, people have to be responsible with their duties at work. Besides, if you want to get a higher level position, then you can do it by learning more about your job and showing your effort and hard working everyday. In this days, is hard to get a good and stable job because it requires effort and knowledge, but being active and always doing something to make a wonderful work will let you find an amazing job. By the other hand, being idle can give you bad consequences like, you can be fired, never find a job or never be successful in life.

I am sure that most people accomplish more when they study at school to get good grades, at sport when they practice and believe in themselves to become an extraordinary player, and at work when they learn and give a lot of effort to fulfill their goals. ",4.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5
477B00F899E2,"Student-designed Projects Encourage Learning

Summers can be boring for students, especially when homework is assigned. Students have creative minds and a variety of interests which can be specialized to a topic of interest; however, schools tend to assign a generic assignment to all students despite their differences. Summer projects are intended to enable students to continue learning and exploring the world through a lense of their interest. Therefore, allowing students to design their own summer projects allows for their interests to spark, their creativity to grow, and their areas of knowledge to expand.

Firstly, student-designed summer projects will allow for every student to specify the project on his or her interests. Every child is different and shows admiration towards different subjects in school. If teachers design the summer project, the students will lack incentive to explore an area of interest as that has already been done for them. Additionally, teachers will attempt to design the summer project in a way that it applies to all students; however, not all students think alike. For example, most middle schools conduct science fairs that allow kids to explore an area of science that particularly interests them. This allows for children to research heavily into a subject and even enjoy doing so. This not only sparks an interest for science, but it also allows students to show off their abilities and specialize in their talents. This science fair analogy can be applied to summer projects because children will develop their admiration towards an educational topic and will enjoy the learning process. This creates a positive incentive for learning despite it being summer.

Secondly, if students are enabled to design their own summer projects, creativity will occur and develop. When teachers design projects, students are incentified to simply follow instructions and do as they are told. This results in surface level researching and a lack of interest in actually learning and retaining knowledge. This is understandable as most students do not enjoy a generic assignment that does not apply specifically to their interests. However, if students were given the opportunity to design their own project, they could research a subject that sparks their interest and creativity. This will lead to a deeper understanding of the topic and will result in a better quality of summer projects completed over all. For example, refering back to the science fair analogy, most students will become creative and design their own experiments if they are given the opportunity to do so. Most students enjoy being given the freedom and trust to become creative and show off their interests.

Lastly, when students return to school after summer break, they will see a variety of interesting summer projects completed by their classmates. The student-designed projects allow for a large variety of topics to be explored, and will benefit the students intensely. If all students, for example, have the same assignment, they would be less interested in their classmates projects as they would all be generically similar. However, if the students have the opportunity to design and conduct their own research into their favorite topic, then the students can share each others interesting new insights with each other and spread their knowledge. This increases students admiration for learning and will inentify them to study something interesting for their classmates.

In conclusion, allowing students to design their own summer projects allows for their interests to be explored, their creativity to flourish, and their areas of knowledge to expand. Schools tend to fail to recognise that each student is different, and that he or she requires different learning styles in order to be successfull in learning. It is vital that students are given the opportunity to become creative and explore an interest that is dear to them. If this is not prioritized, schools will continue to foster the idea of simply following instructions.",4.5,4.5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Make our own decisions is one of the things that characterize us as a humans, our necessity to express what we feel, what we wish, is the thing that have show us what are we capable of make, do, learn, built, invent, all the things that you can imagine in here are because humanity express their thoughts and make their own decisions.

Otherwise you are autonomous and you do not need that someone tells you what to do all the time, but do not take my point wrong, I am not saying you can do whatever you want because sometimes you would need some help and I can give you some examples where and how sometimes you would need help and your decisions and choices can not be just yours.

It can be in a court, your job, school or when you are not an adult, as you can see that there are some places, situations and times you can not decide for you own.

I believe we can make our owns decisions because I know if we do everything according to the rules that are around us, we can really choose our life and take responsibilities for that.

In fact, you are free to take your own decisions and be responsible for them(when you choose wrong) because it does not mater if you take a wrong decision, it matter that if you have the opportunity to try and figure what you want, it is okay to be wrong sometimes and also is wonderful to be right, the important thing is that you can choose because deserve to have the right to build your life, be wrong, learn and be free.",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,2.5,3.0

Im not saying that you shouldnt do you're work but dont forget to do that work you need to get energy. Another reason is if youre sick and cant move around so you dont have to do anything then as well. There are many excuses for you not to do something.

You should do stuff tho like the important things you need done. For instance go to a doctors appointment or get groceriec. Just because you dont have to do something all the time doesnt mean you shouldnt move from being an idle.

You should never be an idle tho. You should always get up and get an excersise or cardio because laying down and not doing anything can also cause sickness in your body that you dont want.

4AAD1243DE3D,"Having a problem can lead to success if you try your best. ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best""- Duke Ellington. Everyone has problems in their lives even if it's a small or big issue, everyone wants easy fix problems but sometimes having them can give people chances to do their best. Being in a big issue where people don't know what do to, they will have to take chances and having to think to get out of the situation.

For example if someone forgets their homework at school some choices are to print the homework at home or at a library. Not knowing what to do on a homework is never good but trying your best, even if it's wrong. Duke Ellington is right because taking chances to do your best is great and you never know if something you made or done could be used in the future. Every job have situations for example builders may not have the materials that are needed, or teachers may not be able to read the handwriting.

People who do parcor have to do their best to not fall off a building and if they are in a situation where they can jump to a different building or thing they might have to take chances and do their best to get to the other side. Anything can be a problem but if you try your best that is all that matters. ",2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
4B907938595D,"Technology can be healthy in my life? I believe that this prompt will have negative effects in my life. Sometimes we need talk to somebody, we need help, we need to be sociable with people that is around me.

Everyone can be sociable without technology. Technology can help us with things that could be hard for us but sometimes, we need to be sociable ass well. The technology cannot be my friend because at the beginning we can feel satisfaction with technology. After, we'll see that technology is not everything and i start to asking my self what i do? where is everyone? and i never spent to much time with my family, friends, mom, dad. In fact, i can changes my mind and do the right things.

Sometimes, spent time with my family can help me because we can talk without phones, for example: When we are going to eat, nobody can have their phones in the table because my parents said that technology will be disrespectful and also, technology can take out my time with my family for example: Sometimes i need to do my test at home or homework but, i stay in the computer and i never go to eat with my family that's for i said that we can enjoy, and spend a lot of time with our parents.

The communication is very important in our life. If we have homework, work ships. We can share our ideas and help us each other for example: When i came here at the united states i don't even know English and i was scared in my first day at school because i thought that nobody could speak Spanish for help me but, there was many people to help me and give me information about what the teacher said. Now i understand and i can defect my self with English that's for i said the communication is very important in our life.

In conclusion the technology can be a negative idea in our life because we just want to play in the computer or phones. Sometimes, the technology can help us in so many things for example: test, and work ships but, when we have time with our family, we has to enjoy, and pay attention to then. Family is very important also, the communication is another factor that we has to take care.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5

Cyber security is a career i would like to pursue as i get older, it would be a dream come true to come work with you and your staff. Being able to hack for a living would be amazing.

Cyber security interest me ever since i got introduced into hacking. I did little hacks like into my brothers computer or jail braking my phone, Little things like that. I would like to one day work for the FBI ,and help protect important information from other hackers. If i were to get selected to come visit and learn ,it would one day would help me in the future. i hope to make it big one day and hope to work along you.

It would be great to get a feel of what it would feel like to work in that environment. i wonder what it feels like is the; place quiet, what equipment do they use, how long have they been working as a hacker. Ive never visited a FBI agency, i hope i do though to witness all of you guys in action and what you do on a daily basis. This program would because it would give me an idea of the work environment so when i get older i know what im getting into. Also it would get even more motivated to wor harder every day to make it big and work with the FBI.

4C3AFB55C4F7,"Imagine someone that you know, that is trying to show you what maturity looks like. And she set a example for you to see, by how she talk and how she treats her friends and family. You watch how the person act and talk. Later, you start to follow what that person does. This influenced you to also be respectful to the people around you. Setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others because people follow what you do,know right from wrong, they are going to influence more other people.

First reason, setting a good example to influence others is the best thing because people follow what you do. They look up to you as a role model for them. Whoever you hang around with, that is whoever going to influence you. For example, if someone is doing a act of kindness, then you are going to do the exact same thing, because it influenced you. Philosopher Albert Schweitzer said,"" Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" Overall, if one person set a good example in life, it influence the others also.

Second reason, setting a good example is the best way to influence others because you know right from wrong. If no one set examples for others to see, then they would not know what to do when difficult situation arrives. Examples guide you to do what you know is right. People would not know how to act if there's no examples to be set. In summary, examples setting by other people help you make good decisions in life.

Third reason, some people may believe that setting examples by someone's behavior is not the best way to influence others. However, I believe that setting examples is the best way to influence others because it's not just one person that they are influencing, but many more people. For example, if a girl help a elder lady that needed help with carrying groceries inside the house, then others will see that and learn to help people that are in need also. Because of that one influence, others will care for people that need help. If one person set a good example, then others will also set a good example for many more people. In conclusion, many people will be influenced because of that one example that people set.

The best way to influence someone is through examples that are set by others, and how their behavior and attitudes are towards people. Setting examples is a good way to show people what you are trying to teach them and it gives them a idea of what's happening. Through all of these examples that people had set for you, they will influence you. When you do the example, because it influenced you, others will also catch that influence from you. So yes, setting examples is the only thing that will influence people and make a big impact in people's lives. ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5
4CB5C9A9AD5A,"I am not agree with this, because the school hours star at 7 am and end to 2:10 pm, in that time we can work after school, and do other important things that we have in the day, but if the school adopted this rule, the days for the students are gone ,because if the school take that rule , the students are going home from the school at 4 pm, and they are arrive home at 5 pm ,so they don't going to have time for do others things, like work or do the homework ,because they just go home to sleep and do some things that the students have to do in home for help in the house.

But for the work weeks are better because they are going to have more time or one more day for have fun with their family and they don't have any problems because they just have to stay two more hour and they going to have one more day off and that is better for they, because is like that they are working that day ,and they get the same pay and the workers just go to work and then go home.

Except for some students are different because they have to go to the school and they have to get up early ,and after school they have to go at work, that is difficult for some students, because they go in to the work after school like at 2:30 , and go out like at 12:00 am, and they don't sleep nothing the rest of the night, and they come tired to the school but they still come to the school, and they do the work that they have to do in the school, and the home too, so that is why that going to affect the students.

I don't think that this new rule going to benefit the students, that rule just benefit the workers, because they going to have one more day left, and to more hours of work in the day, but for the students they get up early and go out of the school late ,and that is bad because, we don't going to have more time for work, just for study and do home work and sleep, that is all the things that we going to do, if the school adopted that rule the day for students are going to be gone for them.

I disagree with this plan because everyone will be in a bad mood they will start to skip school and do bad acts, teens will be late to work and lose there jobs, and i feel like if we add more time to school there will be no tine for family.

First, the school bored wants to add more time to school. Kids and teachers are already tried, adding more time will make it worst it will start making kids wanna skip school or even start acting bad. I have a friend who will already skip school some days. he said, ""school can get to boreding who will wanna sit in class longer inside of playing soccer with you friends."" I think there will be more kids will skip school like my friend.

Then, some kids or teens like the high school kids, will be later for there jobs. My sister work at PizzaHut right after school. Adding more time to school will make her late to work, they will even fire her for being late. If the school board adds more time they will be taken jobs and money away from teens like my sis.

finely, family is every inporden if the school bored adds more time to school there will no time for family. School already take up a lot of time. I love to be with my family and i'll pick it over school anytime. Me and my family watch movies each friday. My step dad picks outr the movies with my little brother, and i help out my mom making the popcarn. It's so much fun, but if school has to be longer then I will not be able to watch movies and others kids will not be able to family stuff too.

4D35A86F4929,"I agree with Thomas Jefferson that we can accomplish many things together. In many cases people are in active and they lose a lot opportunities. It is better to be society, fight for the benefits and to be .an active person. This can change many things in people's lives.

We have to be society to not procrastinate about daily tasks. If we are always participating and if we are always involving ourselves in an event or task that is beneficial to oneself or other. It helps build a sense of standards for society and also builds up a persons attitude

Accomplishing something does not always mean achieving a goal, it could also be perform regular tasks with the best benefits.

They have to fight for benefits what they want and no waist any opportunity. In my case i am always an inactive person and lose a lot of opportunity along the way. The opportunities I had and i lost because i am an inactive person and that's bad.

It is better to fight every day to achieve the things we want in life. With the thing that i had to past is better to fight and strive to be successful.

Active person can help people reach their goals, It feel good help people and use time wisely. In this world people have big goals in order to reach these goals people need to work for them. Small action like help or participating in community people take that like a big change in society. Time is limited in a day people use this time to accomplishing they goals. Being in active person can change the world and make a difference.

In conclusion it does not matter who you are but we have to be sociable. to meet the goals and have benefit with the things we want and fight for the things we want to achieve in life.

4DB99E2F46E3,"Yes. Having a positive attitude helps you alout to be a succesful person in life. It helps you to be a parent, coatch,teacher,and friend....ect

Positive atitude is one of the basic rules that all employees follow such as a waeter or cashier. They learned it to win the customer and to get the business seccessful. When i worked in Krespy Kreem my manager tought me something which is a way to win the customer with a positive attitude that i have to follow. the service called ""the sweet"" service this word stand for smile,welcome,entice,engage,and thank. Having a positive attitude help you to beacame a friend and close to people and people will alwys feel confortable to talk to you. But having a negative attitude will make poeple fell unsafe around you and you will be lonely and not welcomed to the most of people.

Having a positive attitude also help you to be a teacher because you will always motivate your students and provide for them education. The reason why students skip classes is because of the teacher's attitude. students prefer the teacher who give a friendly smile. Positive attitude helps me alout to be an successful athlet because my coach is always happy from the way i act and my leadership that i do infront of my teamates. It makes me a respectful person and trustful guy.

In fact attitude is the way the person present his/her personality. People with a negative attitude are mostly asocial and introverts.

In my opinion having a positive attitude helps you to be a parent because the childrens get scared from the person who's always angry and frustrated. that's why most of the parents hide thier nerves and they act nicely infront of the child. Couple relationship consider attitude because most of momen prefer the guy with a positive view and who's open for evryone. The best way to live your life and be polite all the time is to have a positive attitude most poeple respect the person who give a smile and greet them. One of the importance of good attitude is bieng a family member. My uncle is the type of person who communicate and discuss with evryone and the way he talk is likeable from evryone because his always friendly and welcomed from poeple.

Politicians with positive attitude are always persuasive because they use communication skills to convince the audience by telling thier speech. Attitude is a way to find a job because when the person get an enterview with a manger he has to answer the question kindly and with a respectful way. One of the reasons of bieng a good student is acting with a positive attitude infront of my classmate.

I agree that a positive attitude is the key to success in life becuase its the way to live with poeple and find a job and create a family. ",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0

Many people won't grow, for the simple reason that they still live in the past, want to repair a mistake from the past, and miss somebody or something they had before.

Is totally true and the reason behind it if we don't let our past go as humans we know that at a certain time those things might come back and probably will hurt us a little bit more than the first time.

Living the past is something not easy but we have to understand that there are so many good and bad times in life. That sometimes, whenever something happen to us when get stuck and stop doing what you were doing for that moment . We feel like it will be the ed of the world because once something happen happens we felt like that little mistake will the fine our future but when is not five to six months can pass and we still living in the past. We still living in something that instead for us to stop us it showed us a lesson on how things in life work because we think we can't do anything that will fix our mistakes we've done in life.

Repairing certain things in our lives something could be harder than it seems the reason why is we feel we've do many bad things that all we feel inside of if that we're guilty for the simple reason that we just don't fin a solution and we feel like we've hurt eve the one around us when probably it was just something that life wanted us to happen to teach us a lesson and learn from it, but we see it on a negative way like if it happen only God knows why this and that happened to me like it was the biggest things of our lives.

When people had gotten hurt in the past sometimes is one of those painfullest things because once someone had hurt us we don't socialist with people when that's when also you are hurting people by not talking to them by not doing anything and because at once someone fail to us we don't want to trust anybody for a simple of one person when it shouldn be like that we juts have to learn how to forgive the ones that ave hurt us in he past but we felt like that is not the right thing to do.

in all of this three thing we just have to learn how to live with it our past won't define who you are right now or who your are going to be in a few years we just have to learn to live no matter what we all have situation in life that we right felt down at some point but if you fall just get up and continue the race.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.5
4E0F689E099B,"Imagine a world full of good positive attitude! in this world a positive mind set takes you a long way for example, lets say one day you have decided to go eat out and waiter was having a bad attitude how would that impact you? offended ? perhaps irritated at the waiter for how he/was treating you with a bad attitude. well i'm gonna tell you the pros and some cons if there is any such as at work, home public,and by yourself.

First, People now a days just have a mask on and underneath that mask is a unhappy, sad person,and people live with that causing them to have a bad or a fake attitude toward the people around him/her making the environment not a very positive one. Ive always been told not to be mad or get mad at something it will make that situation 10x harder than it needed to be.

second, Surrounding yourself with positive people, people that have a great attitude ,people who love to see you succeed in you goals or at anything, people who dont bring you down, people who support and love you, people that tell you can do it. Hang around people with that attitude and i promise you, you yourself will succeed be happy in and out and have a positive attitude.

Life is always gonna have its ups and downs shoot, shoot i'm only a 17 year old boy and i had lots of barriers lots of downs lots of fake people that have came in and out of my life but my mother that mistakes are the beauty in life that you learn from them and prosper and grow dont let that change your attitude because it will change the way you think the way you talk i can go on and on about how a positive attitude can make you a better person and be successful in life.

Having a negative attitude is just negative and thats a ugly word being negative can impact you in so many ways at work nobody wants to hire a rude or behaved person because it would make the company look bad make your parents look bad and make you look bad. a negative attitude can bring, negative, thoughts negative actions and nobody wants that. even at home having and bad attitude and mama and thats a attitude you are going to regret when you get a smack across the face.

So yes i strongly agree that a positive attitude will take you a long way. Make you a better person and last make you successful person in life. Stay positive in a negative situation because it will make things ten times worse if you are mad or down learn to heal yourself time a time out step outside take a breather and think before you say or do. life is beautiful but its makes it ugly if you attitude is ugly so change it and make yourself a better. healthier person. i know this is out of the promt but to be succesful in life and to be what you wanna be you have to do that yourself nobody is going to do it for you. but first START OFF with making YOURSELF HAPPY for you not for anyone else.

4EB117877F23,"I feel that we should work in groups because its more beneficial and others might have a better idea then you about something. Working alone might be boring for some people and if that person does know that they are doing the groupe could hekp them.

The first reason why I think wokring in groups is more beneficial is because more than on brain think better. More then one person can help on what they are working on. They can help each other on what they need help on. Four people in a group can get things down faster then only one person. People in groups have less to do then one person because in a group everyone does something and being by yourself mean you have to do everything on your own. You also get more tired if your wokring alone and in a group your talking to one other and discusing what you are going to do.

Another reason why I think wokring in gourps is more beneficial is becuase you can learn something new from another person and if your working alone you only have what you know. In a group you come up with more ideas and support them if you think they are right or wrong. If you work alone you get stressed out and if you work in a group you know what you have to do and thata the rest of your group is doing, but if they need help you can help them out on what they need.

My thrid reasaon why I think working in a group is better is becuase you can support other people ideas and oppinions on what they think is better on the work. They can have a better idea then you do and might work better on the job. If you wokr alone you only have your ideas that you think are good but if you work in a group someone could have a better idea or oppinion.

I feel that we should work in groups because its more beneficial and others might have a better idea then you about something.

Experts may know more about life's important matters than most people. They might've learned from experience or studied others, a class of sociology. They know if something is wrong with the person, if they had a bad day, and if they had sleep.

Some individuals don't really know how to make the correct choices, they often try to make the worst choices work but that will never happen. They're afraid on what the good choices bring, if it brings good or if it brings worse.

One idea for student's is they every school realized every year differents options in menu for bote students in one sitio web and when they have a results change the menu in school is a very well benefit for students because when you eat good your brain is more concentrate in your work is have more energy, one idea is in the morning take a frut's, or cofee and then in loch eat popeyes,chipotle,tacos and others more options because students in a long time is omg again this food the point is change food in school every year differents options for eat it's good have differents menu for year eat new food.

School is need created the importants points they students need realized after school teh first is the every students is need due ten minutes the exercise then go to lonch and take foood for eat then go to your regular classes in teh 10:00am go to lonch and eat tacos,popeyes,chipotle etc. and drink a natural water they contained natural fruts then keep going with your classes is very well take differents options in the school they realized for students look for your benefit and students is more concentarte,have new energy brain always positive because the change is wounderful in your life is very well health.

524CD617574D,"Do you think success consists of going from failure to failure? Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" In my opinion, when you want to reach your goal or your dream you can fail or success but you shouldn't never give up you should keep trying till you reach your goal. So, I do not agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of the success. There's no people that hasn't failed in his/her life at least once but there are some that did success, you only have to work really hard or fight for what you want, and you shouldn never loss your enthusiasm, that is something that people should never forget, to have enthusiasm for something.

First, there is not people that has not failed at least once in their whole life. In this world there is a lot of people that had mistaken, failed or disappointed. For example in their goal, getting a job, not getting good grades in school, not succeeding and etc. there is no perfect people that hasn't make any mistake. Failing does not always have to be about your personal life. You could fail your family or friends just by lying them or disappointing them. Maybe there are some people that hasn't failed just few like 1%. I do said this because my cousin, she has never disappointed or failed their parents she has really good grades and have a higher score in school she already graduated with a scholarship. Now she is in Virginia Tech University.

In order to reach your goal or your dream, you have to work really hard to success. If you had failed once or more do not get sad or depressed yourself you are strong enough to handle it. There is always an opportunity or another chance that life will give you. Work hard you should never give up easily, fight for what you want reach your big dream. Life is not easy life is hard no one ever has said that life was easy if you want something you have to work hard for it, I know you get drop down(sad) by failing in something but you can get up. If you can't success in something make another plans there is a lot to do and another opportunities that you can get, do not just get stuck in one thing. Look for other things that you want and maybe you will like it and enjoy it.

People in this world should never lose their enthusiasm. You are enthusiasm for something go for it do not let other people to do that for you or take it. Enthusiasm is something to appreciate and work hard for it. Not everyone is enthusiasm they dont have that; that interest, that strong warmth of feeling, or that inspired of something you would love to do or have. Be proud of yourself if you are enthusiastic for something. People without it has no feeling for something they don't care about their lives or future they only get what they can do for it, they don't give their feeling for it. They accept what they get. For Instance, when I was a kid I use to be really good at my school I was the best student with good grades, but when I moved here to US I had to start again because I didnt know any English so to success with my English I really had to work hard.

In conclusion, I do not agree with Churchill's statement. Success does not have to consists of going from failure to failure. You do fail a lot of times but If you don't give up and work really hard you can success for your goal or your big dream. Just never lose the enthusiasm that you have for something, that keeps you up for it, the warmth feeling you have the inspire and interest for it is strong so don't give up. Always work hard for what you want and you will success. Life isn't easy not even for reach people. ",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0
529A633179FF,"Have you ever wondered about the important's and the difference between imagination and knowledge? Knowledge and imagination are both very important but I think knowledge is more important. Imagination is like thinking about something, or putting your self in that situation, while knowledge is an understanding gained by actual experience and it is also known as something learned and kept in your mind. Knowledge helps a lot of people to get jobs so everyone should try to get a knowledge so they can use it to help other people that dont have a very good knowledge.

Majority of all the humans in the world get their knowledge from schools. They either get it from a public school which is made by the government or they get their knowledge from a private school which is made by and individual, or a group of people. Schools provide knowledge to students by putting them in classes with students that are their age. you need knowledge to give the students the information you learned, you cant be selfish with you knowledge because you must have been thought by some one, or you must have used someones resources to be intelligent. So if you a good education help other people that are not as smart as you because they can help you when you need it in life.

If there was no knowledge in the world there will be no electronic devices that we can use, there will be no new inventions. We are gonna need more doctors to study and find out the cures to all the new diseases that is spreading around the world thats why we have schools and teachers to help. I think all knowledge should be free from first grade to the end of your college year. having to pay for college education makes a lot of students drop out and do drugs and they always get addicted to drugs and alcohol they even try to be you tubers or rappers which must of the time does not work.

finally I disagree that imagination is more important than knowledge. So if you have a good knowledge you should be proud to share it with others. Imagination i also good for you but you should focus more on getting you knowledge so you can help others. helping others makes makes you feel much better about your self and it makes you day better.",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5

52DC3B7C3952,"Working From Home

Should students be allowed to attend classes from home? I agree that attending classes while at home would be beneficial for many people and can actually help them work better. One reason is that it would be less stressful for the student and put a lot less pressure into getting the work done. Another reason is that it would give them more time to work, for example they could relax and take little breaks while working instead of having to cram all that work into one class session. My last reason is that it would help improve grades. If a student is allowed to work while being at home, it would allow their brain time to think more about their work and how they can improve it.

Attending classes from home would be less stressful and put a lot less pressure on the student. For example, one class session is an hour and thirty minutes. Teachers give a lot of work to students and expect them to get it done without any problem, but the problem is they can't because being forced to do a lot of work is not very fun and with very limited time can put a lot of stress on the teenage brain and also damage their mental health. Expectations now a days are really high for students but their mental health and state aren't taken into consideration.

Time is of the essence. Students need time to get their work done and whatever they aren't able to complete becomes homework. Having to do a lot of work without being able to take a break can really suck. Imagine if you had to do a bunch of work without being able to take a rest because whatever you don't complete you're gonna have to complete at home. If students could work from home, they'd have all the time they need to get their work done and they could take a break if they got too tired. At home students wouldn't have to worry about time because they could complete the work at their own pace.

Grades are important, and when a student gets a bad grade, it isn't exactly the best look. Working from home would allow students more time to think about their work, when in a classroom students can't spend a lot of time thinking because they don't have much time. On the other hand, being at home would give them all the time they could possibly need to complete their work and how they could improve it for a better grade. If students could improve their work they would get better grades, and there's no better place to do that then home, the place you're most comfortable with.

To sum it all up, students should be allowed to attend classes from home because it causes less stress and pressure which is better for their mental health, gives them more time to think and do their work, and helps improve their grades while in a place they're more comfortable with.",5.0,5.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,5.0

It will change your impression by how you get more skills like how to knowing yourself by finding jobs where you comfortable with. so that way when people wants to know you by personality they will know that first impression it has impossible to change because you have made yourself to make it and think that you can do it like other people do, then you will realize that you made a good experience. Not everyone has a same first impression because they had different personality and idea for their self, some of them is not changing of their impression the reason why is they do not trying them self what they believe that everyone has knowledge even if they can. The people who experiencing their impression that has already change their life, they are the one who having more self confident and they willing to sacrifices to spend time not for just wasting time. Based on this statement impression will change as impossible If they are being like kind a person do not really care about future career because they want to be useless as a person.

53607F113053,"Although they say it is better to not try to redo things you already mastered then you will never grow,Actually it is better to retry something you already mastered,one example is you will have more experienced on the task your suppose to accomplish with. Another example is they would take you in as a responsible person.

One of the following examples I mentioned was how you will have more experienced on the task your suppose to accomplish because having that experience their is so many things that can get done. With the experience you can multitask. In today's society people around the world have their own jobs and work and from now then have experienced the job. For me when I got my first job I didn't have no experience I did not know what I was doing so they trained me from then I started getting the hang of it I knew from then what my job was to do. I've been working at Party City for a year already and I already have experienced even have the chance to become a manager from the store. All I know is that with experience things can get accomplished and turn out fine to the best things that get done.

Another example that i mentioned was they can see you as a responsible person and they know what rights and wrongs you can show them. A responsible person can show so many ideas or reasons for someone to be that good person they expect themselves to be. In today's society that we live in their is so many people all around the world who are responsible for their actions they know what is best. For example when it comes to babysitting one of my siblings its a huge responsibility to take care just like how my parents left them for me thats how they want to come and find them. It's my job for them to make sure they don't get hurt and for me to have the time to feed them and to please them from the things they want. My mother calls me responsible since I know that I love kids and its my job to keep them safe. Responsibility matters in society good things can come your way if you honestly see yourself doing big things that are right in life.

However the opposite of trying something you already mastered is ""If you don't retry something you mastered then you will never grow"" meaning won't get to accomplish what you could have accomplished more and wont experience new choices or things. The things that people in society do which in life it can come to a time that you have to redo something it is best to retry and if you don't it then you wont accomplish things meaning it wont take you nowhere cause you would forget other then that you wont get to experienced anything new that you couldn't accomplish.

Through out society we know that it's best to retry things and to keep completing the accomplishments that wanted to get done either it's best to keep building up more experiences and to be come responsible person or to not even retry to do the things you were doing before which they would not get you nowhere. Through out life it's a big chance which you can see yourself happy and from then having a smile on your face. People even complementing you about how well done things you accomplished. What I believe in is to never give up to retry things that were done before and that it can still be redone no matter what day it is in life, it's always better to accomplish then to not even try.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5
53CF6D801CAF,"I'm agree with what has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in the life. ""Generic_Name, my son, remember, you always have to have a positive mindset."" This is a quote that my grandmother kept telling me over and over again before I came to the United States. She used to tell me that negativity attracts failure. throughout my life I have always looked at the positive side. For this reason I believe that having a positive attitude is the key to success as it assists in keeping resiliency, and courage, which are essential in accomplishing goals.

We must have a positive attitude to be successful because it helps humans to be resilient. I have gone through numerous of challenges in my life including being homeless, but I always look at the good things I have, and think about those who do not have any support. A positive attitude helps people be resilient and confront everything that comes their way.

Another reason why we must be positive is because being positive brings courage. Courage allows us to not give up when we want to accomplish goals. For instance, crossing the border is dangerous, however, with courage and being positive, I have been able to cross it. Now I am about to graduate high school. I have also been successful and will be an electrician, I could not accomplish this without a positive attitude.

There are many people out there that think that being positive bring people's hope down if things don't go their way. But I do not agree. being negative brings bad wives, and bad wives brings bad things this is why I also surround myself with positive people.

To conclude , being positive is the key to success. I strongly believe this because positively brings resilient and courage. Resilient and courage are two characteristics that are important to succeed. In my life, I have been able to succeed because I have remain positive. So, I say, to everyone, think positive!",5.0,4.5,5.0,4.5,4.5,4.0

First, when we where kinds we have only positive attitude,we only think in positive things as what we want to wen we grow up, for example: some kinds said theta they want to doctors,astronauts, and teachers; some kids said that they want to be doctors because, they want to save lives,

and find the priest for the cancer, some kids said that they want to be a astronauts because, they that to go to the moon, some kids said that they want to be teachers because, they want to teach others kind something that they know and they know is gonna be helpful for them in life.

Second, when we turn to the ages of adolescent, we start thinking in our graduation of high school and what university we want to go that is better for us, we think in positive thing that can can be better in our lives, something positive so we can have a better future and not be in gangs or things like that that can cost our lives, In my opinion positive attitude in can help you to find find a better way in your lives to find what you really want to be, and just that it can help you to find good friends and good works, because your attitude It's what makes a better person.

Finally, when we turn to the age of adult we start thinking in what we gonna do to gives a better future to ours children. when we turn to adults and we have kids we start thinking is positive things that can help to our kids in there future, if we have a positive attitude everything that we do for ours kids It's gonna be all right, because we know that what we are doing is positive and not negative, but is we do things with a negative attitude we know that ours kids are gonna get things wrong and then they gonna a have a negative attitude as we teach them in home, thats why we have to teach then just positive attitude.

In conclusion,

positive attitude is the key to success in life, because positive attitude it can help you to find a better life, makes good friends, find a great job, and it can help you to gives a better future to ours kids, positive attitude is the key to keep going forward and have a better life.",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0

I think it's really interesting to hear about other people back experiences. In overall if someone is trying to talk to you about their past experiences you should pay close attention because it could come handy in life.

One of the reasons why it's important to learn about other's past experiences is because it could help you out in the future. For example if you encounter the same situation as them you'll know what to do,in the other hand if you didn't pay attention to them and you face the same situation they did you'll be clueless on what to do. If a friend is in trouble or he needs advice with something you could help them out because of other's past experiences.

Another reason why it could be important to listen to someone's past experiences is so you don't make the same mistakes as them. When I was 8 years old my grandpa used to tell me that smoking wasn't good at all even tho he did it all the time,then my dad told me the same thing about smoking so I'll always know that smoking it's not good for anyone's health and I won't make the same mistake my grandpa did.

Every student has diffents talents, or are intrested in diffrent activities and subjects. Why cant students have the advantage of chosing class that fit to there prefrance. Studnets should be able to take a class that is intresting to them that does'nt have to do wwith music, drama, or art. Some students would like to take class for the opportunity of graduate earily. Others would like to take classes that are based on future careers that are intreging to them.

Having to take a class that is based on art or drama and not being good or intrested in it must be a little fustrating to a studnet. Studnets most likely will lose focuse or wonder off in class if not intrested. Sometimes might even oviod the class. As a studnet myself i amdit that losing focuse in class when not being intrested came very easy to me. Not only does it cause the sttudent fustraction but it also causes the teacher fustration to see a student not pertesapating in class.

School is a piec of pie for some students and having to take classes that are an easy A seems to be a wast of time for some studnets that would like to get high school over with and jump right into college. Some high school provide studnets free college credit classes that benifits fanatuly wise and skill wise. Having more then enough credits helps the student one graduate early and two have credits even before starting college. Taking advance classes or college credit classes looks really good on college resmates.

What if the students would have the advantge of having a glance of the career that they are intrested during high school. Not ever studnets know the career or path that they would like to take during high school, but some stduents do know. Also why not giving those students that are confused or lost about what career they would like to mager in college an opprtunity to expermant classes during high scchool.

One enjoyable way to spend time outdoors is by playing sports. I say this because everybody loves playing sports both girls and boys like to play sports. People can choose to play soccer, basketball, baseball, or golf. These activities are enjoyable because people like to be active and when their active they play sports they go outside to play sports. They can play in competition or just scoring points whichever way is best to have fun.

Another enjoyable way to spend time outdoors is going to a pool. I say this because people like to swim when it's hot outside to cool them down a little. People can go to a community pool for people who know how to swim and for people who don't know how to swim. The people at the community pool can teach others how to swim but it's gonna cost some money but its worth it. I say this is enjoyable because people like to have fun in the pool especially if it's during the summer . People can swim and play volleyball or play catch while in the pool to have fun.

583DC3D2E7FC,"I think that people who graduate a year early to go into the workforce, or start college early isn't a good idea or decision. People end up missing out on a lot of High school experiences. High school should be about making memories and making the best out of the four years they have left. Having time to be focusing on deciding what kind of career they want to have in the future. High school gets people ready for deciding about what they want to be when they grow up.

People who finish High school early might not be 100% sure on what they want to do or what they want to be. Also, having to take summer courses and classes takes away from having a summer and enjoying it. Spending time with family and friends, traveling. Although people have the ability to finish early you'd end up missing summer and always working on classes,doing projects,doing homework,or extra credit assignments,etc. Even though most people who finish early have a lot of pressure on them to try and get the most work done so they can finish early. It could get stressful because they're studying for exams and trying to stay on top of their grades and assignments.

I think it's better to have the full 4 years of high school because you would have more time to do things like sports, clubs,etc. Being apart of a team. Going to games and competitions. Going to powder puff home, football games, etc. Also if you're apart of a club like Photography,choir,film, or any club they would be able to make a lot more memories and have time.

Especially During their last year of high school. Missing out on senior events, senior class trips,having fun being a senior. Having Senior privileges, early release, late arrival, Eating at lunch in the senior patio. Having senior class trips, Graduating. finishing all your assignments and getting out of school a month early. Getting senior class rings, having memories of getting ready the day or night of graduation. During your senior year since your almost done with High school you get to have less classes because you have all your credits.

In conclusion i think it's best if people don't graduate early because they'd miss out on the full 4 years high school experience. Being able to make memories with friends, meeting new people throughout the 4 years. Participating in school clubs and sports teams. Making the most out of high school events like homecoming, and prom. I believe it's better and easier to graduate after the four years. ",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5

5902C2E86345,"Is influencing others other even a good? I believe that there are better ways to influence other than just by your own. One other better way is to look at other people and see how they have seceded in life. Another way is to see ones appearance and how they act. Others think differently and believe that your own behavior the the best to influence others.

My first reason why I believe there are better ways to influence other is one will look at other and want to be like them. This will want him or she to start and think on what they want for them selves. Maybe they do not know what they want to be yet when they grow up. So by seeing others and how they have seceded they are going to want to try new things. Looking at others by can also help the influence them by what not to do and learn form others mistakes. This could help them start on the right way. Thats why feel like looking at other can influence others.

My second reason is ones appearance cause when someone sees someone they judge off your appearance and how you act. The way someone else looks will want them to be like you if you are dressed with a suit and tie. That is because a person that is dressed sharp or elegant makes you look prfecinal Also seeing others the way they act can influence others to want to act like them. They might see how other act towards them and them probably want other to act the same with him or herself.

Others think differently and feel that your own behavior is the best way to influence one another. Some people might believe this because one person could impact one person so much that it will want that other person to do the same. I feel like that not the best way cause its hard for just one person to do so much. I feel like one person can not do as much as many other people can.

Therefore,this is why I feel like there are better ways to influence others than your own. Like notice others and see how good they are doing in live and might get inspired. Another is a way one looks to someone or they way they are as a person. Others might think the opposite and say that ones owns actions it the most impact full way on other people.

The disadvantages of adding two extra hours to school can cause a lot of problems for the student ,and the teachers. Especially for students that have jobs and, have activity after school like sports and clubs. Also the student will be tired after school and they will have less time hang out with friends after school .The teachers can also have problems because they can possibly live in a different county and they might need to leave earlier to pick up their kids from school. Either way i think it's a bad idea because it could ruin everyone daily routines.

The advantage to be in school longer is that you would be able to finish work on time. Have more time on test and quiz. Will be able to learn more things in class and get more time in a class. Therefor, teacher would rarely give out homework. Students would be able to take more class ,and even be able to graduate faster because we are in school longer. Also we will have four days a week in school ,so that's means we have three day off so we can get some rest. We might be able to get out of school faster became the amount of time we are in school.

Well I still think it's still a bad idea for school to start later because a lot of problems for students , and the teachers. I think the students won't like the idea because some students have work after school ,or they have to pick up their siblings from school. Or even have sports after school. Some teachers possibly live thirty-minutes away and they might need to get their kids ,and they might need to go to the store and get food for dinner.

It is a good idea because they can start working when they are really young, It is a good idea too because they can make money when they are young, It is a good idea because they can buy they own things with their own money, like a house, a car, or whatever they want, and they can get graduate really young and that is the way to prepare you for something.

For example you can stop living with your family you can be indepent, nobody can tell you anything you can rent your own room just for you and you can have your own space, another example is that you are young maybe you make a wrong decision in the career that you choose but the good option is that you are young you already did the high school maybe you already work so you have money you can start another career more important something that these time you already liked because you are more older you know more about what you really want. Also in the work that you have you can study a little bit more and you can scale to another position too much better when you are young you're body don't feel so tired when you work because you have more energy, but when you are more older your body start feel tired, you start loose energy the sickness come your body hurt you have to go more to the doctor, so when you are young you can work more for you retirement.

Any career is hard but is vital in life. I believe that it is a good idea for students to join a career in a young age because they gain more experience, students can work in a young age. These are two major things why they should participate, sooner I'll explain it.

Students could gain more experience in a particular career. This is because the brain still fresh and is perfect to learn new things. Teenagers would be able to learn new things everyday. They can learn how to solve a simple thing, for example at home with electrical or mechanical issue. Furthermore, students could be able to be masters in the future of any career. They could be experts because they will have a longer period of time to practice and keep finding stuff to learn. If a person have experience they can even become managers.

A career would help to find better jobs. sometimes people see careers as a waste of time but, if a person go to a job with a career taking;that person is able to earn money. If a person have experience they can even become managers. Besides, students are able to work in a young age. They could work in summer break. I believe that this can help them to save money to go to college. Furthermore, teenagers are capable to practice their skills.

In conclusion, any career can be useful to succeed in life. Teenagers are able to choice their future. They could master the career to perfection.

Students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because if they are in High School and if they are in 12 grade , and they need some classes to pass they can take online that classes . Because if they dont pass that classes they are going to lose the year in High School , and all the students they are not going to graduated.

My second paragraph is , what I think is if schools offer classes online and/or video conferencing , to the students that means that they really want to help students when they dont attent to school. For instance ; that schools are really good they need to help all students that they need some help , if they offer that classes online is because they want all the students to work hard every single day at home or anywhere, they wanted to work on those classes online , and if you take classes online you can take notes to help you when you have to take a quiz about what you read and what you know.

If students deside to go school , they can take all the classes that they want to take . They can take in the school were they went but; if they don't want to take classes online its does't matter what they want to do if they work from home by the way online , they can work in the school if they want or at home if they wanted to work really hard without any reason and if you get good grades on that classes and you understand everything you can pass that classes.

That school's give us a oportunity to work on classes online , if we want to work with other's classes that we don't have yet .

For example people that how like to do all their work at home they do not like to contacts with others, people they just have contact with their self and on my opinion that is not a good way,because you need to had contacts with the other peoples to understand how to do the work or any question that they have.

People had developed tenchnology as an aid to civilize ,adquiere more knowledge ,expende their social relationships But some people misuse it and abuse it by killing and creating threats to humanity so the world could be in crisis.

In comclution , The tenchnology had a negative effect on the society just for people that who know how to use corretly or because they think that tenchnology is everyting and they can do everyting with the tenchnology .",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5
5A977087E7E8,"Dear Principal; Changing the cafeteria lunch for a healthier lunch is a good idea. There is going to be new food, healthier food, and different types of food that others students never taste before. As a student I really like this idea because there is going to be a healthy food for all of us.

New lunch menu, having a new lunch is going to make many students happy because there are students that are getting tired of having the same lunch almost everyday, but it also can effect others students because there are many students that enjoy eating the same lunch and they never get tired, In thus case is better is you as a principal talk to the cafeteria manager and ask her for a list of wich food is the students favorite and at the end ypu and your company can decided whether you change the menu or not, but as a students I think it's also better if you just see wich food students like and take away the food that students eats the least and change that for the new food and live the food that students likes.

Students might be happy, Because you are not taking the food that students likes and also bringing different menu that students will be happy to have. We are trying different menu and that is also making us be different from others schools and they would see our school as a example, and they are going to do the same and is quit better because is not only our students that are getting tired of the cafeteria menu, there are others students in different schools that are also going trough to this issue. Schools from different states might see us and take the same idea as you have principal, that is going to halp not just the students it also helping our parents to save money, Because students that dont like the menu no more are telling their parents to buy then food from outside, and somentimes does parents dont have the money to do so. It also can help students dont skip classes to go buy from from outside bucause they dont like the food no more, that can help the students, parents, and also the school from not having a bad reputation.

Tasting different types of menu, trying new things like food is somenthing that students also loves I put my self for example. There are students that likes to try different food, the cafeteria have bad and healthy food but its not equal and for that we need a change, we need to have more healthier food, some studets are also alergit to food that is in the cafeteria and thats why they dont eat and they get sick because they eat only at home and most of the time we in school and we dont have the opportunity to go out and buy food. Bringing healthy and different lunch menu is good, becase we are able to taste differnt food and healthier, students wont need to get out of class just to go and buy food from outside, its dangerous that just for students that skip it also for our parents, Because the school call and let our parents thet we skip and they get worry for you fo not letting then know where you are or what are you doing.

My conclution is that students are going to be happy if you just ask the cafeteria manager fo a list of wich food students loves the most, and one of wich one they like the least. Thats is going to help all students to be conform with the new changes that you wants to do, students are going to have their favorite food and others students wont need to skip class to go out and buy food, parents won't be worry no more and students are not going to take any risk of getting sick because they dont eat. Healthy food it can help us with many things like, your body, less fat, and more proteins are going to be in our body. Parents won't have to buy food for the kids no more and they are going to save money, Changing the school menu is a great idea that most of the students are going to understand, and for the one that don't they are going t get used to it. Thats going to help every students and people from outside are goin to see the changes in the school and others schools should start doing the same for their students. Healthy life with less risk of everything. This is my sincerity opinion and hopefully the Principal takes some ideas of what the students think and what is the best for all of us.

I think phone policy at school should not let students use their phone during class or free time. For several reasons. First, school has to be an area of education and not of free time. Because in my point of view its a distraction to your self and the people around you. Second, phones could get stolen by the people you don't get along with. Also, another reason for school policy to know is that it can cause drama between friends and also people you don't know. Finally , phones can cause cheating, cheating is what school doesn't want so that's one of my main reasons why i don't want phones being used in school hours,",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5
5AFBB5573AB3,"Have you ever just sat at home all day and used your phone? Oder food or play games and Facetime friends? being on technology doesnt help you make friends or help you get out of the house.

Some people say its a negative effect on people because all they do is use their phone when they need something, instead of going out getting fresh air or hanging out with friends. People that are constantly on their phones can cause them depression, because all they do is sit at home, and the phone provides them everything. it can also draw you away from friends and can be a distraction at school

It also can be a positive effect because you get to text your friends, for example example if a friend moved out of state you would still have contact with them. its also easier to do homework, or you can read a book online instead of going to the library and getting one.

""Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others"" in that quote it says that you can finish a task without having contacts with people, how is someone suppose to have social contacts with people? how do you learn new things or new meet people? Thats why technology can be bad for someone people.

For example when I'm on my phone all day cause i'm sick or stayed home from school I get bored being on my phone all day, yes the phone is useful but it doesnt help staying in your room all day watching a movie or a show, you dont get to learn anything. Talking to people and having social contact is sometimes better, you learn a new word or a new fact each day, but theres some negatives in all of it, you can lose close friends because you get distracted on your phone and you dont listen to what they have to say.

Theres a lot to do beside staying at home and being on your phone, you can go out and get lunch with friends instead of sitting at home and eating alone. I know a few people that don't have many friends, so they are usually on their phones a lot, you can see the difference, people that are on their phone a lot and just sit at home don't really know how to act in public. People sometimes dont like going out and trying new things because they got used to being on their phones.

In conclusion technology is a negative effect on people because it doesnt allow them to see whats outside of their phones. They tend to just use their phones when sometime its better if they talk to their friends in person. Using your phone can take you away from your friends and it isnt a good thing.

5B40AA0E6C2B,"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. I agree with this statement about the importance of attitude of the people. I think is very important to be positive and has a good attitude with everybody.

In the other head, many people likes the people that has a positive attitude. For example when I was in my country Generic_City. There is a woman call Generic_Name she have a small restaurant in the park front to her house . She was sell I say was because I don't know if she still has the restaurant. However In the restaurant she was sell many type of food. For example soup, chicken, pupusas and Generic_Name need someone to help her with the restaurant job. And there is a woman her name is Generic_Name she is very smart however she has a bad attitude with every body.

She went to apply for the restaurant job and she has a good experience in the restaurant. And there is other woman name Generic_Name she is very nice and she always try to help others in the community also she has a positive attitude with the people. Generic_Name call Generic_Name and Generic_Name Because Generic_Name want to interview. Also she want meet they and see how they are and what they know about work in a restaurant.

The fist woman the come to Generic_Name house was Generic_Name she don't say good morning she just went to Generic_Name and say I am interesting in the job.

Generic_Name was very surprising because her just ask for the job don""t in troduce herself and Generic_Name told her that she already has someone to help her in the restaurant. Generic_Name just say ok bye. After one hour Generic_Name come to Generic_Name House and she say good Morning I am Generic_Name it is here where they are hearing someone to help work in a restaurant.

Generic_Name told her yes so Generic_Name was talking with Generic_Name and Generic_Name know that Generic_Name know a little about work in a restaurant bout she notice that she is smart and with the time she well be learn fast and she well be appreciate the opportunity that Generic_Name is give to her. Also Generic_Name has a positive attitude went she was speaking with Generic_Name.

In fact I think has a positive attitude is the key to success in life. For example, few days ago my father was very worry because he has just two days to finish one of the big job the he has. He was thinking to ask my brother if he has time to came help him. My brother told him that he is going to help him and he look at my father he was very worry and he ask my father what is happen why he look worry.

my father told him that is for the job that he has he just has two days to finish and my brother always has a positive attitude and he told my father to don't worry that everything is going to be okay. And he is going to do his best to help him with the job. He is going to do the more fast that he can and he is going to ask his friends to came and help hem with his big project. After two days they finish the job on time. And My father boss was so happy that they do a great job and my father was very proud of my brother because he has a positive attitude and he believe in his self.

This is why I think that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. Because is help to win many things with the family and other persons.",2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0

If you wanna get a healthy life , would you change it ?

change the schools menu gonna be a great opportunity to improve the kids healthy because they will eat less fast food and junk food, they will get a good health. the schools will spend less money buying good food for their students, and the some students with overweight will loose weight.

it has been said that eat fruits and vegetables are a good way to start a good feeding, these kinds of foods got a lot of good tings on like protein and fiber. In fact some kinds of foods like hamburgers, pizza, candies, etc are pretty bad for your feeding and healthy because they got many sugars, and calories on .In fact eliminating those kinds of junk food or fast food would a god opportunity to improve student's health.

The schools in the country spend millions and millions of dollars every year on fast food. Some fast food are really expensive, moreover some schools would like to earn more money and spend that money on education. in fact, that is a good chance to start earning money.

Some students with overweight have problems in school, like having bad grades and bulling .

He is very young, and he has that talent of being good at soccer! He plays nationally and makes lots of money. He has a skillful job and is very young, thats why being a soccer player is an extrordinairy job! My talent at soccer could not only give me a good job, I can make lots of money from soccer.

5D5672D7C97D,"The famous scientist Albert Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" This is especially true for today's world. Even with seven billion people on Earth, everyone is unique. Your imagination is vast; an open plain of wondrous ideas and possibilities. This leads to even more diversity than our physical differences. It is also applied to our day, and it makes it more lively. And while knowledge is powerful, imagination can make it far stronger. Imagination is more important than knowledge because of creativity and experimentation.

First, imagination leads to creativity. Your can put your ideas to life through creativity, and there's plenty of ways to do so. You can construct a masterpiece of your choosing, whether it be art, music, or even writing! Even thousands of years ago, creativity makes its mark. Rough drawings by cavemen depict tales of hunts and adventures. Beautiful artifacts and pottery dot museums. Ancient literature such as Beowulf and The Odyssey still fascinate modern writers. And recently, artists and musicians such as Bob Ross and Duke Ellington have made amazing pieces through their creativity, just like the legendary Leonardo da Vinci and Beethoven. Time wears things down, but not imagination. This is immensely important as creativity allows you to express yourself. You can voice out your thoughts and ideas in so many forms. With imagination being limitless, so is your creativity, and so are your possibilities.

Next, imagination leads to more experimentation. Going mad-scientist isn't recommended, but you can poke around with new ideas and find a new talent or hobby. More experimenting can lead you to find something you really enjoy!

Trial and error can be disheartening, but don't give up! You could find something that could change your future. It can be fun too; testing different paths to a single destination. Not only can you find the best road to a goal, but you can spread the knowledge to others. The results from tinkering around varies from little things to giant discoveries. Take Damascus steel for example. The forging process for the metal has been lost, which has consistently frustrated modern metallurgists. A steel from times long gone, but still baffling today's scientists. That's a pretty amazing feat! Experimenting from your imagination is wild, but it's enjoyable and even rewarding!

However, some say knowledge helps daily life more than imagination. Valuable things, such as language, mathematics, history, and science. Knowledge does help with life, but most of the things you learn are often useless or forgotten along the way. Math and Language Arts are important, but unless you're pursuing teaching or poetry, some aspects aren't very useful. For example, being acknowledged that plants are green because of chlorophyll isn't going to help with paying taxes. Imagination can make life better and enjoyable. Decorating your house or doodling a picture can be more relaxing and fun than first thought. In addition, most of the knowledge obtained can't be applied without a good imagination. And while some people may have an upper edge in academics, everyone is on equal ground in imagination.

In conclusion, being able to experiment and create with limitless possibilities makes imagination more important than knowledge. Making ideas come to life is fun and shows what you're capable of. Creativity holds the ever-important ability to express yourself. Experimentation is enjoyable and can be rewarding. You never know what you can do unless you try, and testing your skills is a great evaluation. And all of this traces back to one thing everyone has: an imagination.",4.5,5.0,5.0,4.5,4.5,5.0
5D693DD9978D,"How will be high school different if you will graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years? Three years things happen very fast than four years. you can't learn a lot things that happen in high school in three year because you will follow different plan for to graduate early. It is not a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college because I have to force my work, I will be indecisive and I won't be able to take elective course. All this will be hared days for me to finish my high school in three years.

Firstly, if I want to graduate in three years I have to force my work because I must have to take courses during the summers or in the evenings. And I do not wanna do that because normally my family every summer go to visit different country. Also I have to take course course during the evenings where I go to play soccer because I like to play. For example, if I want to graduate early I could not do this and I am to young to force my life, I have time to take this things slow because when I force my work I feel like my work will be wrong and I could not learn anything and that can not help me to go to the college. So three years is to short to learn everything that we have to learn in high school. It is not a good idea to force your work because like you did to learn things from the high school is how you will forget it.

Also, finish your high school in three years do not let you to think about what you want to study for the college because your course will be to short and you won't to do a good decision. If you have a lot time you can think better and you can find a new goal. For example, when i was in eleven grade i did not what i want to study when i will go to the college. But now i am taking geometry and i like it. Now like to be architect because i found that math is one of my favorite class. If i just took three years of high school i did not what want to do for college. So three years is to short to take decision for go to the college, you can go but as a indecisive student.

Finally, high school in three years will be boring for me without course elective because there two courses electives that i like. One of them is art and band those became me a good students, they change my life. For example, when i play the violin in my class with my classmate that moment, i forget everything that was wrong in my life. Another example is art where i can draw my happiness and i can remember that the life is not wrong. So i prefer to study four year and take my course elective than to study three years whiteout enjoy my high school with my course elective. it is a not a good idea to students to study three years of high school because they won't find the taste of high school.

Some people think that work force, indecisive person and won't be able to take course elective is better because they want to graduate early. They do not care about their life, they just want to do this to do that and they do not learn anything. However, to go the college you need to be more prepare because college is different than high school. That is why must of the college is hard to enter because some educational programs offer that allow high school student to graduate in three years and then when they go to college they do not anything. Because in three years is not enough for a high school students.",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0

For example I had to do an assignment similar to this and I told them all of my most productive activates I could think of and almost everyone was similar to my activities like they do the same activities as I do too. You'll never know if you meet new people that you've never seen before or heard before and they turn nice and you guys could be good friends. I had friends from my soccer team and they were in my school that I didn't even knew that they were in my school so I started to hang out with them in school and after soccer practice. It's basically about friendship because if someone wants to meet more and new people they should go try out something they like and try it out with their future friends and enjoy together. For example, I keep meeting more and more people because of after school activities or someone in school that is friends with their friends. If you disagreed with the principals decision you would just do the same routine all year until summer has came and then high school and then that will be the similar routine and then graduation and then you've decided to go to college and it's another same routine for how long you're gonna be there and then you get a job and it'll be another same routine until you retire and then you just go home and rest until you die, sure it would be similar if you agreed but sometimes you just gotta try what's new what's been going on or how's it going go out with your friends and then you guys get closer and you've decided you guys wanted to hang out and do whatever you want to do. Sometimes your parents might force you do to some activities at school or outside of school it's because they want you to feel like you've like accomplished everything in life and you've decided to try something new for once and will actually enjoy it and stick to it as long as you live or until you quit or retire.

5DEDECE96044,"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose. cellphones has become the major problem in schools for students and for teachers.

Cellphones shouldn't be allowed for educacional purpose because students dont do that work that they suposted be doing. Sometimes students take pictures of homework or a test and then they pass it to a friend. They always wants to check theirs social media like snapchat or instagram. this in one reason why students fail classes or fail grades. For example, in my English class there is a guy who is always using his phone, checking his social media or checking his messages that his friends has be sending to him and he is not passing his classes.

Also, cellphones shouldn't be allowed for educational purpose because schools already have tecnology for students can use. The government gives the schools computers because they wants the students graduate and dont have any distraction by using theirs cellphones.

schools have computers or ipads and thas why teacher dont need to let the students use their phone to do any work that they have to do.

However, Students can do their work in the computer where the teacher can be checking what the students is doing, if his doing his work or not.

Some students might say that they can use their cellphones in the classroom because it is more easy for them to translate words than be looking words in the dictionary. Also, some students might say that they can't live with out using their phone. Finally, they might say that using theirs phone can be more easy because they can be checking their work any time that they want.

In conclution, I think that cellphones shuldn't be allowed in the class room. students have to learn how to live with out their phone because graduate and not fail classes is more important than be texting their friends all the time.

Next, if one person give you bad inpressions, maybe you not try to talk to him or her. Finally, if you want to shopping, you will saw the appraisal about the store.

First, when you go to any restaurant to finish lunch or dinner, you want a perfect food for yourself. you waiting for food like 15 minute, after 15 minute, the food coming, but, the food looking for squeamish, you will disappointment, because, you feeling it's a bad food and can't eating that.

That is comprehensible but not all the time. I strongly agree that having a positive attitude can walk you threw success. In my opinion I think having a positive attitude is the key of success because It make you feel confident on what you are doing.

First of all, a positive attitude would help you to achieve many things. For example, one time I was taking a Math test, I was not thinking positive, I thought I would failed that test and that's what happened. In addition, I had my chance to retake the test and I went with a positive mind and I did it, I pass my test. Positive attitude also helped me to not get stress because I was positive and I knew I would pass that test. Therefore, a positive attitude can help you in many ways. It make you think that you are going to pass every test even thought you haven't studied.

Second of all, with positive attitude you can achieve many of your goals. Another example, one time when I was trying to get a job I was thinking in a way that I said to myself that I would not get that job. At that time I said that I can do it, That I'm going to get that job because now I have a positive attitude. At that moment when I got that job I felt so happy and my new boss told me that she liked the way that I had a positive attitude and that I was capable for the job. This shows that, a positive attitude can lead you to success.

Third of all, some people say that having a positive attitude is not going to guide you to success. They say that even thought you think in a negative way or in a positive way you can still achieve many of your goals. But, when you think in a positive way, It make you feel better and confident on what you are doing, because when you think negatively you can feel depress or sad because you don't believe on your self. Also, It can make you feel that you are not capable to, and you would fail. Furthermore, a positive attitude can guide you and walk you threw success.

To conclude, a positive attitude can walk you threw success. You can achieve many things, many goals, etc. It help you to be confident while you are doing something that is hard. It also help you to believe on your self. For me there were many times that I was thinking negatively and I didn't achieve many things but now that I have a positive attitude I'm achieving many of my goals and it make me fell proud of me.

Every goals that we make in our life is important to do it,even that is not like we thought. Also do our goals can affect are live psychologyly, such as can make us more confindent of ourselves. ''The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short;but setting in our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" Setting our aim too high and falling short is more important because we feel better knowing that we did our best and we can discover new things that maybe we never thought to do.

First, we feel better knowing that we did our best to make are goals,even that is not at all like we thought. When I was 11 years old and I used to play soccer, and one of my goal was to win play in a proffesional soccer team and win trophies,even that I did play for a proffesional soccer team I won many trophies. Trying to make real the goals that we used to had when we were young make us to feel proud and confident of ourselves because we never get up, always fough to do it.

Another reason, when we make our goals, even that maybe we just complete tha half of our goals;we discover new things that maybe we did not know that we can made. For example, if my dream was to be a master chef, and I work at place where a cook food to helping homeless. So, I realized that I can make my goal helping other people. When my brother was a kid, his dream was to travel around the world;even that he is pilot and only go to airport, he meet his fiance in his job. Some people may say that complete only the half of our challenging goals make us disappoined of ourselves because we did not complete. However, copmplete a challenging goals make us proud of ourselves because we are people who worked really hard and we discover many things that maybe others will never do.

Overall, we learn more doing challenging goals in our life than doing small goals that maybe everyone can do essaly.

Also,

making challenging goals we realize that we are people who want to be succsesful in our life. In addition, making challenging goals make us in admiralble people because noy every person decide to make big steps in life.",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5
605C1B4CE788,"Today I'm going to share my thoughts about Author Ralph Waldo Emerzon wrote to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest acomplishment.

I would say yes is the greatest acomplishment because if you trying to be someone in the world but you don't have no body to be with you is wanna be more difficult but if you try your best you can make it but if you have like people with you that is trying to help you is wanna be more easy, so I think to be your self in world that is constantly tying to make you something else it's one of the greatest acomplishment.

I would say is true because to be yourself around people that is negative is wanna be difficult. So to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you soemthing else is the greatest acomplishment.

for example

If you just been yourself and you making all that you want, a lot of people they not wanna like that so they wanna try to make you fall, so if you been in a world that is constantly trying to make you else is always wanna be the greastest acomplishment.

if you are in a world that people like you only for been yourself it is good becasue you just been yourself you can make anything happen and if you have a world that is constantly trying to make something else is the best acomplishment because everything is wanna be more easy for you sometimes you have to choose decision and i think just been yourself you always can taje the right ones",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0

60623DB5DE7A,"Four-day work week, a remarkable idea to conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted the idea of a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. I think this idea is amazing, workers would have a day off and they won't be wasting energy and resources like in a regular day of work. Therefore i think my school should follow this model and extend the school day two hours in a four-day school week. Students would be happy of having a day off, and most of them would support the idea of having a four-day school week. By following this idea, my school would conserve energy and a lot of resources such as papers, school materials, food, etc.

A four-day school week benefit students and teachers in many ways, students would have a day off and time to do extra curricular activities such as sports or work, teachers would be at home and have time to spend with their kids and be with the family, and all of us would be conserving energy and resources. One disadvantage of having a four-day school week is that some parents work 5 days a week in different companies and these companies might not have the four-day work week so they won't have time to be with their kids at home in the day off, and some of them would be forced to change their five-day work week to a four-day work week, so they can be with their kids at home.

Personally, i would prefer the four-day school week, because,i have a part-time job after school , it is from 5 to 10pm, and having a day off would allow me to have time to do some extra work at home and to change my schedule for in the morning so i can have the rest of the day to work on my stuffs, have time to chill, or maybe to do my homework, and help my mom with whatever she needs.

Having a four-day school week, would let me have time to do a lot of things during the day, for example, babysit my little brother if my mom goes out, go to the gym or maybe help my dad. I can get another job to work on the weekends, the thing is that it would allow me to be busy, and to generate money.

In my family, my dad is the one who is always at work, he works from 8am to 6pm everyday, he doesn't have a day off, but it is okay for him. My mom, she doesn't work, she is always at home taking care of me and my little brother, for my parents, it wouldn't be a problem for me to have four days of school a week, because my mom would take care of me during that day off.

In conclusion, i think having a four-day school week, would benefit a lot of people, because just like me, there are plenty of students that would love to work more and generate money, and for the teachers, well they would enjoy have a day off and spend time with their kids at home.",4.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5

Emerson's was right with this quote people have think more then just of what they believe, if they grow they will achieve their dreams if they achieve they will grow you just have to believe in what you are.

Unless you try to do something respect, you have to do the best of you if you want to grow. Base in my experiences I'm growing, I try hard, and I try to convince the other do to the same, we want a better world we students to grow if they grow this will be a proud for the others. If we don't an open mind this will be the opposite we will never grow,no matter what is happening he we have to grow.

At the end of all of this we will have something do where we can be support our live, always come something better, you have to be organize with your things. The idea is to be your self don't ever let other people to control you just be you, and the decision is on you.

Don't you ever be an a position to where you have to decide between to options? That's when you to believe in yourself, to thing want your want to be grow or stay in the floor. If you grow will be more opportunities for you and maybe don't just for you can be for the others who are around of you.

There are benefits to grow like you can be a person who can do almost all the things ,you can be accept or be sociable.

60CCF0F2DF38,"Dear Winston Churchill,

I strongly believe that, failure plays a huge role in pursuing success, and I have a personal story and also information to back up my statement ""that failing is the key to success"".

The news article of daily life, had a section dedicated to failing is a key to success, in that portion it talks about how the most successful people in the world had to fail so many times and hardship in that portion of the article it interviews Bill Gates and he quote on quote said that ""failing thought me that you have to try harder and harder every time you fail in order to successed"", and without failing he would not be the CEO of Google.

I personally have experienced how failing is the key to success. I started playing football in my freshman year in high school. I was trying so hard to get a starting position on the football team. I was doing really bad during team practice, and one day my coach came up to me and told me that I should quit football, and how it was not the right sport for me. So I got cut from the team but I did not listen to what my coach said to me. I kept practicing over the off season working harder then ever. When sophomore season came up and we had to go through tryouts in order to make the team. I was doing really good in the first two days of the tryouts but then I started doing really bad on the third day, and then the coach came up to me on the last day of the tryouts, and told me that I did not make the team. I started feeling really hopeless but I still did not gave up and kept working harder and harder. On my junior season it was time for the football tryouts once again. I started doing really good, and the coaches were really impressed of what I was capable of doing. Last day of the tryouts the coach came up to me, and told me that he was really proud of me. He was really surprised that I didnt gave up, and after that he told me I made the team as a starting defensive tackle.

In conclusion this is why I strongly agree that failing is a key to success, without failure we as human beings would not be able to improve in our day to day life. It is because of failing which keeps us successful, and makes us humans work harder for what we want in life.

623B7BD7613C,"If you have heard of the author Ralph Waldo Emerson, then maybe you would have remembered that he once wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" and if you don't agree with his statement on individuality; here is why you should. You should have the freedom to make choices for yourself and have independence of action and thought.

Although pleasing loved ones and being like everyone else in a collective identity can set a moral behavior or have good personal characteristics by which an individual is recognizable as a member of a group; like a sense of belonging. It also feels good when collective aspects of the communities's characteristics; like values or common interests by which something is distinctly recognizable or known and is indivisible to the individual and so you start to feel proud of your community, much like patriotism or nationalism.

But you should have the freedom to instinctively or consistently question your community if it contains fundamental errors in reasoning. For example a principle, belief, idea, or opinion of a collective or person's authority that is considered to be absolute truth is dogma. You should also be sometimes skeptical of the advice of you're friends and family members as well because they could mistakenly give you the wrong opinion about a course of action but you should still listen and have trust in them on everything else.

Inclusion you should be yourself and think for yourself and aggregate the qualities and characteristics that distinguish one from others and have the assertion of one's own will and personality.",4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0
64AE19BBA321,"A problem is a chance for you to do your best. I agree with this statement because of many reasons, first reason why I agree is it never will solve the problem if you don't try to at least do it, second reason is that you feel more competitive to face the problem, the last reason is that your friends and family can help you a lot with the problem.

If there is a problem going on with your life you should always try to solve that, and do your best to solve it. If you don't do anything about the problem it is going to effect your life even more. So you might as will do all you can to do something good that can solve the problem. For example someone comes and bullies you everyday, and if you dont do anything about that then its gonna get worse and worse everyday.

When you see a problem getting in your way of accomplishing your goals, you should always stand up for your self and face the problem, and beat the problem so it can never bother you again. Their are many you have to face during your life for example, if there is a someone that always bothers you or bullies you, you should do something about it.

If you had a problem face you there probably someone that helped you a little to solve it. Its always really important to tell a friend or a family whats going on in your life because it always makes you feel better. The reason why it makes you feel better is because when your saying all the problems to your family or friend they kinda have ideas how you can solve it. For example if a bully starts to beat you up then the only people that can help you is family and friends.

A problem is a chance for you to do your best. This statement is a really good statement because it really motivates people to face there problems, and get them out of there way.

64EB91C84A32,"Being able to attend classes online is a dream come true. Many students miss a huge amount of school days because of personal reasons, health, or sports. However, taking a online class would resolve those issues. Students would benefit from online education because there's no reason to miss school and to work in a better environment

Whenever a student misses a day or days of school they fall behind. They then have to do extra work to get all caught up. It causes lots of students stress and sometimes failure. Weather can also cause school to cancel. For instance, snow storms, or floods but working at home doesnt cause you to miss out on school. Students can never be absent in online school because everything is on a laptop. They will always be up to date with there assignments or exams. Students don't have to worry about being late to class anymore either. Instead, students will be stress free sitting on there bed learning.

Every student would rather be at home working then to be working in a classroom. Our own homes make us feel relaxed and clam so therefore, its a safe environment to work in. We don't need to do fire drills or lock down drills in our homes because we know our homes are secure. Also, when students are focus and working on assignments, the time goes by to quick. Next thing you know the bell rings and the students havent finished the assignment yet. Working at home won't make students feel rushed at all. Instead they'll have all the time they need. Adding on to classes going by to quick, classrooms can get very loud. Unlike a classroom filled with students, your home is peaceful with no distractions.

To conclude, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. On the other hand, some students think online school isnt for visual learners but online class has many ways to educate visual learners.

Online class has video conferencing to help better understand. Online school is for every student.                         ",3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5

I am agree with Emerson's statement about individuality because i can demostrate that they said is wrong, to show them what is defference between to make and to talk, and to be concetrate. Those thing i can show the people that i can doing with myself and that make me a greatest accomplishment.

I feel to be myself, it is not depend what people said about me. If i want to change or to be something else in a world, i have to do what my mind say to me, for example if i wanna be a teacher. And they tell me to be a teacher is not important because their payment is trash, they just can earn $1000 each months. But if i like to be teacher do not matter what i earn. They will trying to make me confuse. Maybe they already tried it, but they could not do it , that is why they believe that i could not do it either but not all time is the same, the world change every day so i need to try to show them that what they said it, it was wrong. So it is important do not pay attention people who try to make me confuse.

Also there are two defference between to make and to talk because i can believe in myself but if i just talk and to say i will do this, i will do that and i will not doing nothing. That way i can help the world even i lie myself. But if i did not said none and to show people that i change my life with my attitude. they will come at me and ask me what happend with me? because i am changing. I will tell them that i want to be something else in a world. That will be my greatest accomplishment.

Even if i believe in myself i need to be concentrate because i am human and i am not perfect, i can fail with my decision if i am not concetrate. Because bad people will like to see me on ground they will tell something fun that i missing. For example to study, many people do not like to study because they say that school is boring so that i am doing they believe that is boring. They will try to convence me doing wrong things so i have to demostrate them that i wanna be something else in a world not just have fun.

In conclusion, work individuality is not easy i have

To showto the people that sometime we do not need help from somebody else. Just believe in myself, do not heard what they said about me, to show them what is the defference between to make then to talk and all time to be concentration in what i am doing.

I think that school should be only 3 years. beacause some student don't really want to be in school for too long. this can give student's a goal so that they don't have to stay for 4 years. it would give the students a higher chance to focus in school and then head out to college for those who are interested.

I belive that if student's can find a goal of having to be going for 3 years in school instead of 4 year's. it would take them hard work and confident in order to earn it but other's might say that they perfer to be in school longer. because of friend's or liking to learn alot and it no rush toward them for they are interted in learning.

Being successful in school well help us in our daily life. We will go from failure to failure without the loss of enthusiasim. We know that by being successful in school we are going to have many opportunities in life. Being a failure is not bad, it makes us strong to keep trying more and more. To graduate from high school we all need to pass a certain amount of SOL. Sometimes we pass the SOL some times we dont,Thats what leads us to success because we are going from failure to failure but with enthuisasim ,since we keep trying and trying till we pass the SOL. Because we know that passing the SOL is leading us to success and that we have to work hard and go to success because its not going to come to us if we loss our enthusiasim to keep trying.

Work can make us go from failure to failure ,but enthusiasim well take us to success. Being successful in work may be hard that it might make us feel down or even make us feel like giving up. But always working hard and with alot of enthusiasim will help us succeed and acomplish many things such as getting a higher payment and getting a better employment can be possible if we always work hard towards success and with enthusiasim. Keeping enthusiasim is good because it doesnt only helps you to be motivated to keep working hard towards your goal / Success, but it helps your peers as well since your transmitting them the good vibe and enthusiasim. Others well succed too since your transmitting the good vibe/ enthusiasim to them they will be inspired by you.

Playing a sport is not easy. Alot of practice and dedication is required to because successful in a sport. Becoming successful in a sport will take you from being a failure and to a failure once again . But if you really want to succed in that specific sport that you like ,you will have to try and keep trying with enthusiasim. Trying with enthusiasim willl help you become successful in that sport that you like and that you have been practicing with your dedication and enthusiasim.

Others may say that "" Success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasim"". People say this because they dont try as hard, if they get things wrong at first they give up. People wotn try to work hard and go to success they just give and wait for success to come to them (THATS NEVER HAPPENNING!!!). People also say this ("" success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasim"") because they find it impossible that enthusiasim gives you the strength to keep trying.

Since they are the ones who are the failure that wont work with the enthusiasimto succeed.

Being a failure is not bad. Working to success with the loss of enthusiasim just because we fell a couple of times is bad. Because if we dont work to success and lose our enthusiasim we will never succed in anything we will just live our daily life as a failure. We are all failures but if we work hard we will become a better failure, A failure that succeed in life not a failure who just gives up and loses its enthusiasim. Working to go to success with enthusiasim will help you accomplish your goals and also it will inspire others. Others will also get the same energy as you and will work towards success with enthusiasim. A failure is what makes us strong and successful we just have to give that failure enthusiasim to keep trying and to succeed.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.0
66241AEC8351,"Changing our school meun to much healthier choice's is a good idea because its good for the students to eat much healthier food in school. Eating more fresh fruits and water can help students focus and not fall asleep in class. Eating junk food could make you tired and you won't have theenergy to do anything. Its better to take away the opition of getting junk food that the cafeteria puts out for students. Students wont be so tempted to eat it, and could chose a better and healthier choice.

Most students want to stay in shape, so they try to eat healthier. adding more healthier choices in th school caferteria meun could help them stay in shape. most students don't workout so they depend on the food they eat. Some students tend to buy food and then throw it out becuase of how the food is made. The school could make a slald bar for those who chose to eat it and they could add there own toppings so they could eat somthing they like instead of throwing it out.

I think having fruits smoothies, organic bake goods, and a salad bar could be very good for every school to have because the school could make a lot of money selling this at school and its healthy for students to eat and enjoy. most students wont have to get uber eats to get food that they like if the school sold smoothies or bake goods. And staff members that get lunch from the cafeteria could enjoy having a healthier lunch.

in conclusion changing the schools cafeterias meun to much healthier choice would be good for students and staff members so they could stay healthy and focus.",3.0,3.5,2.5,3.5,4.0,3.0

When you tell more people you get more advice and thats good. Let's say that you have some things going on in your life and you want some advice to try to make it a bit better so you ask a couple of your friends to help you and give you some advice. They give you advice and you take it and try it and it works so it made you feel it better but thats only one advice they gave from all your friends so there is still a bit more. So you day got better. An yes i understand sometimes you don't want to share your stuff with people so you just have one friend you tell everything to and they help with everything they listen,give back what they think. An yea you might have a different thought of if this like you might think just telling one perosn is better because you don't feel like sharing your stuff with people and i get that but when you need advice do you just want that person or alot of people giving you advice. It's your choice on what pick.

But i still asking people for some advice is better because like i said earlier they give more advice, They will give there option and tell if if your in the right or wrong. An they will always be there for you no matter what, thats why i say yes. because you never know what they will tell you or do about the things you tell them but if there real friends they'll stick by yotu side no matter what.",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0
66C2FA45A48B,"Energy and many different resources are a big patrimony that nature gave us,every single person need to take care of every single resource that we have like energy,water,etc. All of those resources complement each other to do their functions for example: without water we would not have energy,water helps to make energy when it is coming down like a waterfall,so there is when water produce energy. We also know the sun is an energy reproducer and we can get a natural energy,the type of machine that is used for that kind of energy is a little expensive,but is better than a normal energy that we use every single day, it is less dangerous for our enviroment. An example of sunlight energy can be the calculators that need to be charged with light,so they do not need batteries which is a good one.

The government and obviously every single person need take care of this amazing resource to conserve it for a long time. Conserve and earn energy is a big challenge for all,we thought that little things like leave the lights turn on for along time and do not use them is a loose of energy and money,those little things affect us believe it or not and of course affects our aconomy. Energy is one of the most expensive resources,we pay for electricity,because to reproduce energy it goes through an expensive process.

The prompt says that adopt a four days of work with each day consisting of ten hours it is going to conserve more energy. I thing that can help us to reduce the lost of energy,but at the end we make the change. I think ten hours of school is not going to make a big difference,first of all that change will create many conflicts with students who practice a sport,have things to do after school,or need to work after school the time is not going to adjust.

Parents will get in troubles to pick their children or to leave them in an extracurricular activities,even if the school adopt that proposal that does not mean that all of the jobs and schools are also going to adopt it,so that is going to affect families who have children in that school. I believe the change is going to be stressful for many parents who both of them need to work. One example can be when people who need a babysitter to take care of their children,we know that person also have a family or have things to do after job and if her job take more time that she usually do is going to affect her. Not all of the people are able or agree to work till late,and if they accept they want to be paid more.

Having a long days of school,I mean more hours that we used to do can be stressful for students that are very mischievous or rude,they just want to go home early as they can and if the school add more hours they are going to be more rude than they are. We are teens,we just want to have a good adolescense. The good thing is that we are going to have one more day off out of school. We used to have two days out of school,but now we are going to have three,so if we add the days like early dismissal,vacations,or because of the weather those are going to be lost days,in fact we are going to lost more days,so I think that is going to affect our academic life. The period of time that we used to have to finish the unity for each class sometimes does not adjust and we get busy,imagine if we just have four days of school plus the teens that like to be absent. In fact,all in the world has advantages and disadvantages as I mentioned.

One of the advantages that I can see is that teenagers are going to be more hours doing good things being in the school,and not waisting their time doing things that are disturbing for them. We usually go to school an average of seven hours,if the businessses want to add two or three more hours to be in total ten hours taking out one day,and becoming just four days of school each day ten hours of work,In my opinion is going to be the same,because the two or three extra hours that they would add is the same that one more day of school;however,what is going to happen with the students that are in sports,have other activities or students that are in clubs,they will going home till night,I believe that is not good for anybody,they are not going to have time to do their homework for the next day,or an extra activity if they want during the rest of the day.

In conclusion let the things stay same till this day,we can conserve energy doing other type of proposal that not affect too much the people and their activities. We can start doing little things like turning off the lights of our house when we do not stay there,or when we do not use them. Those are my thoughts,so we can help our world being more educated with our enviroment and the resources that they provide for us. Energy is something indispensable in our life,so if we do not take care of that resource we are going to have a lot of problems in the future,as energy become more expensive or something like that. We can provide huge things to our country and the world if we want.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5

Other people believe that they should make their own decisions.

It is good for people who make their own decision, so that way they learn from their own mistakes, they need to learn how to get up whenever they feel in trouble. People who make their own decisions they know the consequences, but they know how to grow up as a person, and beat up any problem that they have. Sometimes, it is good to ask someone for advices because older people seems to have more experience in some topics.

First, people who made mistakes in life, they need to learn how to not made that mistake again.

If someone is there just telling people what to do and what not to do, people will never learn how to not made that mistake again.

Sometimes, it is good to ask someone for some help, but they do not have to tell them exactly what do.

If someone need help in something, they need to paid close attention, and see how is that person doing something.

Due to the fact that many people made mistakes, they have to learn how to do decisions by themselves.

Second, people who has been guided by their parents, but their parents are not with for them. Since their parents are not with them, and there is difficult time where some people will need the help of their parent, but because they was use to it, that their parents do everything for them, they will never know what to do.

Because of that, people will never know how to get up and do everything by themselves.

Sometimes, it is easier just to ask someone how to do something, but sadly one day they will be in the same situation, and they will never know how solve it.

Third, people who make their own decisions in life they already know the consequences, but they know how to beat them and grow up as a person.

Sometimes, people do no like to make their own decisions because they are scare to the consequences, but that is a way to grow up as a person. Also, that is how people are a better someone in the future by making their own decisions.

If people are afraid to the consequences of their own decision so that mean that they are not grow up.

In conclusion, people who made mistakes in life, they will learn from those mistakes.

People learn how to not make mistakes by making mistakes, but if people had never made a mistake in their life so that mean that their is someone who guide them through everything in life.

People are not perfect, they learn from their own decisions.

Also, people who is use to be guide by a parent, they do not know how get up whenever they are in a difficult time.

Parents will never be beside people to hold their hands all the time, and that is why people have to learn how to get up.

People who make their own decisions they already know that there are consequences, but they know how beat them, and grow up as a person, and be a better someone.

6907AC535720,"""Stop doing that, your cousin cut his hand because he was doing the same thing"". A lot of times people say an example to make you know what would happen if you continue doing it. But, is the example the best way to influence people? Yes, an example will make you know that you are doing something bad, it will let you know what are the consequences of it, and you know that the example influence others, because you can see that your parents are the most important example in your life; they are going to make you as a person.

When you are doing something bad and the people see it, they will probably tell you an example of something that you are doing something bad or innapropiate; for example, when you are climbing a tree, your mom would tell you stop doing that, your sister broke her arm because she was climbing that tree, that is going to make you think if you are doing something good or bad. It is going to make you know that people are telling this to you, because they don't want you to have bad consequences. Another example would be that when you are drinking, somebody would tell you don't think to drive, because my uncle died because he was drunk and he had a car accident,so you will know that people are advising you, because they know that you are doing something bad. When people tell you a good example to stop doing something, it will make you know that you are doing something bad.

A lot of times you are doing something, and you don't know the consequences of your action, maybe, it can break your arm, or it can send you to the hospital; but when people tell you an example it will let you know the actions; for example, if you are listening to music very loud, you couldn't know that it can make your ears very bad, but when people tell you turn the music down, my sister's ears are very bad because she was listening to music very loud; after that you know that you better stop doing that, because it will bring you very bad consequences, and you do not want that, so you would stop. Another thing, is that knowing the consequences of your actions, could help another people; for example, if you are drinking you should know that you can not drive, if you do not drive another person will not die, because you know that you can have a car accident, and that is because people told you an example of what is going to happen if you drive while you are drunk. An example can help you to know the consequences of your actions.

A lot of people say that you are who you are because of your parents, and that is right, your parents are the most important example for you. They are going to tell you what is good and what is wrong; your parents influence you because they are your most important example, and that is what an example does, influence you, tells you what is good and what is wrong; for example, if your parents are good people, you should be a good person, but if your parents do not care about you, they do not listen to you or they treat people bad, you are going to be somebody who doesn;t listen to people, you will not care about anyone, so your parents are your most important example, because they have taught you what is good and what is wrong; and you can see again that the example influences you. The parents are your most important example and influence.

We saw that an example can make us think what is good and what is wrong, it is going to tell us the consequences of our actions, it will make you think that you are doing something bad, and we can see that the example influences you because we have our parents, we are going to be the same as them, because they are the people that is going to teach us how to act.

First failure gives us the corrage to try something over and over until you gat it because, I have fail before when I was trying out for the school soccer team, I work so hard for it I go to training everytime, and be there on time but i did not made the team I was so sad that i did not made the team but it give me the corrage to try more and more.

Second failure makes us humans learn from our mistakes. we humans are not parfect we all make mistake and learn for it. it like me I am a teenager who cant speak english everwell, whenever I spoke to someone my age thay kept on making fun of me, but I never give up on myseif I know that if I learn from my mistakes I will be better at speaking english.

Finally failure make us stronger. in life in other to get what we want we have to go throught failure it teach us to be strong and to nevergive up on yourseif. everyone go through failure for example president Donold Trump in other to be a president he has to go through som failure.

In conclusion failure is the best thing that can happend to us humans. it teach us to be strong in anything that we want and to learn from our mistakes. failure play a enthusiasm in our lives that makes the world a better place.         ",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0

She was talking with an old man; the man was looking everyday, and she do not figure out because the man told her that he was in another country. Next, she did not talk with the families and she was one more of many young victim of kindnap. Another example, peoples in families use technology inapropiately causing get all on troubles and having less communication between them as human.

Secondly, some people prefer to talk in text message while they are driving. This is cause of many accidents peoples use devices in their car. Sometimes person does not even look who is begin stting next to them. The are some problems as someone told me. Generic_Name was driving with his mother who was in another country: She came to see him, but he did not left the phone alone and look at his back the computer after a two miles, they crash crossing a railroad. Also, we knows the risk of doing it. People think tha using technoly and have less communication with their family anywhere is safe, but they are wrong because one distraction for our limitation with others human can be deadly.

Thirdly, energy is anothers problem because people spend more money. Even know, this increase a lo of accidents because custome's companies just buy lof of thing as computer, cellphone, and toys. The problem is many peoples spend more time plugin in setting beside its divice charger to get some energy in their computer or cellphone. One more example in about this problems Generic_Name was addicted to the computer in his room. He was charging it. He was friendless because of this reason, and Generic_Name did not talk with his family as normally; however, he just say good bye everyday.

In conclusion, Everyone has to stop using technology for unimportant reaso or things. This will be more safe for you and your family. In ddition, limitation of human contact have more consecuences while you are with your family, driving, and spend more enery. It's your time to chane this word.

6AB2B78CE0AF,"One topic that is frequently debated is technology is a positive or negative effects on people's lives. Technology is a positive effect because mostly everything is online. I believe that technology is good because books are online, get talk to other people through a laptop or a smart phone, and can write it on a notepad or word document. Everyone thinks technology is bad cause of the things they see on the news.

Not everyone has time to go to the bookstore and find the book there trying to look for. All books are online now and makes it an easier and faster. When you go on a road trip and nothing to do, you can read on your smart phone or any devices. Parents don't get a lot of time to relax and read a book, but on road trip they can while their children are sleeping in the back. Online books are easy to carry because it's on their smart phones. No more looking for your book when you lost it. Plus online books doesn't loose your spot, gives you an option to put a bookmark on the page you want to save, and if you don't know a word it will give you the definition and translate in another language.

Some people lives in another country or states and it's hard to communicate over a letter or phone call. Using a tablet, laptop, or anything devices that has a camera can do video chat. You can't write a letter and wait for 5-7 days or probably more for a responds. Email is one of the way to send a rough draft or a final draft. Other people can also edit or help you on it. Also on video chat you can call up to how many people and all the time you want. People complain how they can't meet up because they already have plans for other things, but they can just set up a time and day and they can do from everywhere they are at.

Technology is going to upgrade is the near future. Right now everything is at a start point, everyone thinks it's fun to have a tablet, laptop, smart phone, or headphones. Some people like to show when they get something new, but they have to take care of when they get it because technology are expensive. Just think about it in the future more technology will come and no more paper and pencil because everything will be on technology.

Most people like that technology is growing because it's better. Even kids have tablets for learning their ABC's and 123's. In schools, they sometimes provide tablets and laptop for students because they want them to learn better and makes sure they have something to do their work on. Sttudents likes technology because they can research what they need for their project or homework. Also they can watch videos how to do something or explain it better.

Technology is a good way to communicate with or without speaking. . There's many ways to get to everything with no issues or problems. I think technology will be a big part of people's live soon. People should get used to all the technology right now because sooner or later it will become bigger. Everyone will miss paper and pencil, but its a safe and better way to get through everyone. Also it's a good way to communicate with other people faster.  ",3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5
6B20E9C115AF,"I believe that a possitive actitude has a good impression in othre persons. But there around you are person who can influence you to be a bad attitude peson with others. The decison you make to be who you are is to realize that other person will act the same way to you as you just did to them.

Everyone need to be respected don't matter the age, country or religion becuase we all are humans. Been in a poaitive attitude will appeal the attraction of other persons to you by that will hepl you to success. Because if someone is being rude to them and you act different and start helping them they will notice that you have a good attitude to others that you dont even know. By the way you cannot judge someone just for their apparience is like judging a book with out reading it, it can be someone who will look with an angry face, a sad face even it can look weird but if you dont start sharing time, knowing each other, know what they like and what they do or how they are you cannot put your bad attitude just for how they look, they can also treat you as the same you did to them

However, people cannot recieve a bad attitude from you as if they were different to you. I think that we all are same with some differences than others as religion, country, color, etc... . I feel that recieving a bad attitude from a person that you even know is the badest thing that someone can do to you becuase you don't know that person and if you show that reaction from you that means that you're like that with everyone and show that you dont have respect to others. Even in your job is when you need to be the more kind as possible to keep those person that you don't know with you becuase as they need you, you also need them at the same time becuase they will help you to keep that job that you need, also your impression to them has to be best, as you show them at work you also need to show the best of you out of work that will show that you're successeful person in life and that you dont act good just when you need it and that is how you are and they can also trust in you because you are being honest to them.

Considerating that don't matter what you cannot give a bad treat to other person just because you woke up in a bad mood. I believe that if you are in bad mood and think that everthing is going to bother you is better for you to figured it out as soon as posible on you own, because people can not be involved with your own personal problem and i think even if you are not felling well you also need to be in a good attitude to the people because if you let you bad attitude to ruin the days of other they will think that you're always like that and will be enough to them to think the worse of you. However knowing that you don feel well and you gave the best of you to others before, that will be a great acomplishment for you and from now on you will be and example and will help othres that feel the same as you to continue and leave that bad mood behing and show the best of them.

In conclusion a good attitude is one of the important things to success in life. I think that every person have the right to be respected not for what they have is just we all need respect. People cannot be treat it bad because of you mood or just because you didn't like how that person is. Doesn't matter what you can't act bad with other persons, even if you don't know them and think that you will not see them again but the reality is that in other day you can really need from that person but that person will not be there for you because of how you acted before.

6BFDA0FE1CB2,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""to be yourself in a wold that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" I strongly agree. Have you ever felt like you have to be someone else you are not? This is something that most people who living in this world are dealing with. Us human being live in a world nowadays that is actually don't want us to be ourselves, no matter how hard we try, we most likely end up not being confident, and having low self esteem. we think that we have to be someone else to please our society, which is not very true. Therefore fighting with this world to be ourselves is one the greatest accomplishment because, people become more confident, they get the chance to be their real selves, and they don't try to please others.

Firstly, people become more confident. No matter how good a person can look, having no confidence fade the beauty away. No confidence make people look weak and they don't believe much in themselves. As an example, some people may have terrible stuttering problems, and sometimes it may make them feel like not wanting communicate with others, or some people would love to have a conversation, but they might think that they are going to get laughed at because it's hard to get their words out. However fighting this obstacle can improve their lives and build them up to have more confident. This is one reason why I agree being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

Secondly, people get a chance to be their real selves. Some people get lost trying to be someone else that they are not because the society want to change them.

For example, in some countries, especially my country, Haiti, people get bullied for being in the LGBT community. Some parent, family members, or friends might not accept them for who they really are, so they have to hide it and try to be normal like every body else. Sometimes some of them feel like they are getting rejected by the community and they just to want to be alone crying or even want to commit suicide. This is a major reason why I agree being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

Lastly, people don't try to please others. Some people would do absolutely anything to please their significant others or their friends. As they pleasing them, they end up making that person happy and automatically forget about their own happiness, which is not right. For example, some people might have abusive boyfriends/girlfriends who want them to do everything their way. Deep down inside they don't really want to, but they probably love that person and they have to do it if they want to please them. They end up falling in an awful situation that may even risk their lives. This is a last reason why I agree being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

As a summary, be yourself in a wold that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. you become more confident. you get the chance to be the real you. You do not try to please others. If people keeps being themselves in this world that just want them to be someone else, then they would find themselves where they've lost it and they would also find happiness.

6C6B01577E01,"Yes i agree with Churchill's statement about the importance role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because we need to learn to not lose hope in what we want for success and our future. Imagine you keep on failing and failing but knowing your going to be successful in life? Imagine not losing fate or enthusiam to pursuit for success? That is what the Former British Prime Minster once said that ""Success consits of going from failure to failure without the loss of enthusiam."" How would you know your going to fail to pursuit for success?

What is success? Success is to achieve goals you been wanting to accomplished. Everyone wants to accomplished something or anything. It feels extraordinary to be successful in life but to fail is something that no one likes including to success. It's understandable to make mistakes because you can learn from them and try again until you get it right. No one is perfect,it's understanding to make a couple of mistakes here and there knowing you can learn from it.

Everyone wants to be successful in life or in anything. For an example when you apply for a job you to apply first, then wait for a response for the interview,After when the interview is done you have to wait a couple days or two until they call you to notify you if you have gotten the position or not. Well thats how we feel when were trying pursuit for success hoping that we can do this and having fate to not give up.

When you know your failing to pursuit for success is when you keep making mistakes but you keep going until you get it right. No matter how many times you keep making mistakes it won't stop you from what you are doing or trying to get. You can be still successful no matter how much you fail because it will make you smater for success.

Success is something that many have achieved or have not but at the end of the day were resposiable for any mistakes,actions and verbal language that we have used,It could affected anyone or anywhere. As we as people must continue on to be motavated for success if not someone else will speak up and take charge.         ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5
6C86103B510D,"Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" Influencing others with your own behavior is the best example you can give. The example of showing someone your actions than your words is the best way to be an influence. The actions as words are powerful over another's person life but I think that the actions are the best way to show someone who you really are.

I agree with Albert Schweitzer because it is the best way to influence others by showing and doing your own behavior. People follow others because they like the other person's personality does not matter is it good or bad. We always have been influenced in our lives by our family,society, school, and now more than anything the social media.

Some people might no agree with Albert Schweitzer because they might say people are what they want to be not necessary being influence for someone. Also other people might say that people act and react to situations depending on how they feel at the moment and how the situation was based on. However I believe that people are always being influence for someone else without maybe they noticing, that is why I think there is always someone looking at us and maybe we are not paying attention, but our actions and reactions is the only example we can give to others to follow.

I also believe that actions speaks louder than words, that is why for us to be the influence over someone else's life there is nothing better than our own behavior. We all have our own personality,likes and dislikes and sometimes those ""likes and dislikes"" can be an influence for someone else. In my opinion people's actions are really important and have a powerful influence over others.

Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" I believe this is true because at some point of our life we have been influence for someone else looking at how they are and what they do.

Did you know that if you pick up trash out of your way or someone else way you can actually help them think about why did they not pick up trash. Act of kindness are everywhere from picking up trash to doing your brother or your sisters chores one day they will realize something about why you wash their dishes everyday. I think kindness is the most important personality of a human being why i think kindness is a important personality?

You can change peoples mind or the way how they think about some stuff, for example if you can help someone to get across street when their is too much traffic you are doing a act of kindness, and you can help change other kids minds by making them think about their parents who is trying to cross the street trust me they will jump right in. One important thing about kindness is that you always need to have a positive set of mind that means that if someone is asking you for help jump right in and help him don't just answer ""I don't know"" if you actually don't know where the place is try asking someone else if they know about the place the other person is talking about.

Some people take kindness in a negative way only some people and at a certain time some people like to do stuff on their own and sometimes they like their own time and own place and own work they don't any help from others like me sometimes I like to do stuff on my own, but sometimes I need someone to help me. I would like to help people in need for example; taking out someone else trash, helping my new neighbors settle in the community, and mow my new neighbors lawn.

kindness can open many opportunities some people even think that kindness is a part of their religion and I really think it should be a part of every religion because it can really help you and people around you and you can change each others mind or opinion on one thing by kindness,all these thing just does not sound it is possible but it could be. To be honest I think that kindness is one of my superpowers if you ask me but sometimes its not but those times without kindness goes by quickly with kindness on your side you can become anyone you want and be a bigger person that everyone.

In these days people who understand kindness they are actually showing kindness and they are also telling us to be kind to each other. I feel like kindness has become a big part of peoples life in 2019-2020 and i expect the same or more amount of kindness over generations and I also feel like that the person who really teaches us kindness in childhood is our parents.",3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0

People wished that they could of done something to change what they do for a living and do something they will be truly happy with. There are people who are sad and deperessed on the job they have now. It takes time,focus, and motivation for a student to find the career they truly would want to take in the future.

Not everyone is the same there are people who need a long period of time to find out what they would want there career to be. Students might love to do multiple things but cant find out which one to do as there career. Sometimes the students needs to have the experiance and see how it is with there own experiance. Students should not be pushed and forced to pick a career so quickly. Not everyone is able to be like that.

Not most students can afford the right education for the carrer they are being forced to take; therefore the whole time the high schools have been forcing them and guiding them towards a specific career it would all have been a wast of time because they could of not afford the right education for that career. If student are being forced in studying a career they dont want to do and then cant afford the right education to do that they are going to be unhappy and they will b forced to go downhill to a job they would never imagine them doing. And in doing so when they are doing something that they never imagined themselves doing then depression and regret will start happening.

With the job they are being forced into doing they might not be able in doing it. For example if a student is being forced in a scientific field of learning but they know that science isnt there strong suit they will have a hard time and start having a hard time in that field. Students know what is best for them and know what will benifit them and find a path that would be best for there needs.

Some people might say that having students pick a career at a young age will help them in the future because it will give them more time so strengthen that career and become very good at it. What people dont understand is that some students might not be intersted in that and would want something they would b happy with so they can improve on the stuff they know they are good at and have alot of skill in. Students have the right and the liberty in choosing a carrer they would want to do for the rest of there lives they dont need to be pushed into doing it they should take as much time as they need to find what is it that would make them happy.",3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

Some students think that they are waste time in four years in high school. In my opinion is a good idea to finish high school in three years, because the students can take class before school or after school, then, they can graduate in three years instead four years, instead elective courses, the students can take class, they need for graduate, and the students will have more time to go to college.

The students can take class before school or after school, and they can graduate in three years instead four years. The students can come one hour early, before school start, and they can take class every day of school, or they can stay one hour after school to take the class. However, some students think that is tired to come early to the school, or stay after school.

Instead elective courses, the students can take classes, that they need for graduate. The students can use the time, that they uses for the elective courses, they can use it for the classes they need for graduate. The elective courses it does not prepare to the students for college, and the regular classes prepare them for college. If the students finish high school in three years, they will go early to the college.

The students will have more time to study in college. The students will have time to think, what they want to study in college. Also, the students can finish very early their career. However, some students think, they need four years in high school for to be very prepare for college. The students will have time to think, which college they want to go.

I believe that is better finish college in three yeras, because the students get more time to go to college, so, when they finish their career. Then, they can study another career, because they will still young. If, the students stay four years in high school, they will not have enough time to study two careers.

When it comes to choosing, it might be as hard as a stone at the begining because, we are not sure if it is going to work or not. But nothing comes in an easy way if you want the reall succesful ,we need to follow our character.

Whenever we choose our own character, we have the confidence to do on what we are planing to do. And when we have the confidence, it is way easier to manage any case that comes to our life. We do not choose our charater whitout knowing ourself, and that is why it is better to choose our character by knowing what is best for ourself. For exampe: Sometimes in life we get so many bad things on our way, but if we choose to take it easy on them by choosing our best character, that helps a lot because it is making our life easier in an easy way without much stressing.

As long as we know our charachter, we will always have the right chocie to make, because we know what is going to match with our character or with our wantings. Sometimes when we are planing to get married, we do not just guess to match with our parteners ,but we choose our character to match with our partner's character, that is because we know that we can choose our character in any how that makes us feel the best way to our living. Or sometimes you can fall in love but you partener might have a better character then you, so you decide to change your character by choosing your partener's character, and that is why we should choose our own character.

A lot of people choose thier character when they start school, because they see a lot of diffrent characters in school and they start noticing which character belongs to them. Or they can learn from what thier teacher teaches them, and we all know that our teachers are always willing to teach us the best behaviour and that is why the most students start to choose thiere character at school.

When we choose the character that we want, it helps us to find the right people in our life, because we are more happy when we find people that are the same as our character without changing our character.

Although, others may think it is more beneficial working with a group. Working with a group can bring a lot of distractions. Research determined that when it comes to group projects people complain and prefer to work independently. Also, why would you want to work with others if you do not know if they are in the same level as you. When working with a group you have to check up on your group members to see if they finished there part of the project, if they are not responsible enough to finish it themselves you have to fill in for them because it is a group project and project grade.

Does it not feel much better working alone? You can work at your own pace and we all do not have the same mentality, so we do not have to argue with anyone about putting your own ideas and what you think is correct. Let me tell you a little secret, working with a group can be pretty complicated. Always working alone, it is more beneficial.        ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0
7101C080C12C,"What if your school wanted to add one hours and a half would you agree or disagree? I presently think that no one would like that like dont like that idea at all and let me tell you why I would int like that. First if you dont like school that much like me you would do what ever you can to stop that. Most likely be that people will get tired really fast. Finally not that much people would come to school they would not like it even more.

Some ways you might like this is that. They might add a day to the week end which would be more days per week end that sounds good to me. Another thing that they can do is add lease day to the school year I think that people would really like that and other ways are. You learn a lot more thing for next year which is really help full for the next year of classes you have. Finally you simply like school you like seeing friends in school and you like learning more things.

How you may be able to stop it? will first you have to go to your principle and him/her how you can you stop this form going on well they might say get a exact amount of people to sign a paper. Well then if they ask you to do that then you know that you have to ask every one in the school to sign the paper if you really don't want this to happen. First you know you got to go to you best friends and people that dont really like to stay in school that long. However if it's not that much people yet you know you have to go to every one in the school asking them if they dont want a hours and a half to be added and at the end of that i might have the number you need of people.

Do you want this to happen at your school but your school isnt do it? Well like the other one go to your principle and ask them if they can add another hour and a half but and another day to your week end or less day of the school year. See if other student want to join you if they want less day of the school year or a another day addend to the week end like a Monday because every hates Mondays right. If a lot of people agrees you might get this to happen in you school. However there is going to be some one to not like you idea and they might go wrong for you but I think you can get this.

So now that you know how to do this it say do it. If you want this to happen then ask your principal if this can happen in any way. If you want it to happen in your school then do it. If it's happening but you dont want it to happen then stop it. However think what is going to happen if i do it so think what your going to do before you do it.    ",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
71A9098715EB,"Self-reliance is better then hoping someone makes the best decisions for you. This is because people need to follow there own instincts in life no one knows them like they do and what is best for them. Why would anyone want someone to make decisions for them, People will always want what is best for them so if people trust someone to pick a important life decision what if they pick something that will help them in there long run and not you.

My older brother 5 years ago was done with school and was planning his career he wanted to be a engineer but my mom and dad wanted him to be doctor; He made his own decision at the end and now lives his best life with a kid and wife. If he had chose to be a doctor he would be in school still and never meet his wife. This shows how important it is to trust your self even if no one agrees with you.

People will say that someone with more life experious will help others more then they can help them-self but they can make it so much further then others. Im not saying people should't have rolemodle just don't do something because someone else did it do it better then they ever could. My friend Generic_Name wanted to be a football player his whole life he was the best in our middle school team, but his mom and dad hated the idea they thought all football players end up hurt so he did't play in high school he did't like any other sports so he just went to school and went home. this left Generic_Name with not that many friends and he is sad and deperested today.

Making your own decisions all the time can be hard and at some point you may fail but if you keep trying you can make it big one day. There are many reasons to have someone make decisions for you it would be much less stressful and you would have less chance of failing, but everyone need to grow up at some point and do what is best for them, You can't live under someone your whole life at some point you will be on your own.

Those are the reasons I believe everyone should make there own decisions in the long run you will be 10 times the person if you trust your-self and do it your way. A person should never put there life in the hand of anyone but them-self. If someone stops talking to you because they dont like a decision you make and did't do what they said to do then they don't deserve to be in your life.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0
71B72E8890F1,"Summer is a hot and nice season and most students need time to enjoy the break and here is why, so first off most students go on vacation out of state or country to visit family members and they stay longer than three to four weeks. When visitng family you need time to be with them and enjoy time with them, because you wont get to see them often when you leave. Even if the student stays for two weeks and the student returns they will not have enough time to do their summer assignments or to gather materials for school. One month is not enough time and not fair when us students go 10 months straight to school, two months and couple days is a good amount of time to relax.

Also when it is summer there are plenty of activities to do like go to national parks, amusement parks, water parks, play outdoor sports, have gatherings with family members, and relax at home. I mention these type of activities because they are not available in other seasons like fall, winter, and spring. There should not be a week break in fall, because first there are no special holidays or reason why we should have week off, also if no school for a whole week and Columbus Day people will start to get the habit not to come to school. Although a longer break would be nice for the winter, all we need to have is two weeks for Christmas and New Years.

We need to have more time to learn and be prepared for future exams, especially if some students do not have good grades and are falling behind on their work. Some may argue that two months and a couple days is too much, but parents would not like it if their child was starting to stay home and not go to school. We need to have all the time in the world to be educated and be caught up on all missing assignments. Finally it might seem that most students will forget information during the summer, it will not matter because the student will not be learning the same information as last year.",4.0,4.5,4.0,5.0,4.5,4.5

73234AB62383,"Would you wanna be extending 2 more hour to your school schedule because you work for four days for 10 hours? In my opinion I feel like no because sometimes some students decide they want to spend some time with their family . Also some students have to go home early and do something else instead of doing their school work and some students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day.

Some students decide they want to spend sometime with their family. Some students decide that because sometimes they might not have enough time with some one that lives far from them so they decide they want to go where they live and they want to be with them before they leave. Also some students might want to spend more time with there grandparents because they might not be able to see them or they either want to spend more time with there grandparents because they want to help them out side there in the stages of being old so they might need help with something. Also some students might want to hang out with their cousins since they might not have seen them for awhile. Student usually like to spend a lot of time with there family since they might not have seen them for years so they decide they want to spend more time with them .

Some students have to go home early and they have to go do something else instead of doing their work from school. Instead of doing their school work some students have to go after school to go sports so they might not have time to stay in school for 10 hours because they might have to be going to their practice whens school finishes. Some students might have to go straight home because they might have to go babysit their little siblings since there parents are working. Some student might have to go home early because they might have to go straight to work or they might get in trouble if they don't go at the time they tell them they could get into trouble. Students usually have to go do something else instead of having to go do their school work all day.

Some students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day. Instead of staying at school all day or at work all day students decide to go out and hang out with their friends. Some students might want to go out and go shopping .Some student decide to go out and spend some time with their parents since they don't have that much time .Also some student just want to enjoy the only time they are free to do something instead of being stuck at school all day or being stuck at work all day.

In my opinion I feel like we shouldn't add more hours to out school schedule because at this time we are still young and we want to enjoy the free time that we have before we get older because then we won't be having that much time left since we will mostly be in school still or might just be working all day. Also I feel like some people might just be getting tired of all the work they give us to the point were some students might just give up on there work. For example when I get out of school I usually have to go home and take care of my little sister because my mom can't .

I wouldn't like to be stuck in school for another two more hours because I would have to be leaving school late and if I had a four day work week I would not be able to do my school work at home , When I would get home from work I would be really tired and just decide to fall asleep.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5
73F2515B5BCE,"I disagree with the school board extending the school day by one and a half hours extra.

Because Students will no have enough sleep with one and a half hours extra of school with homework,

also students will have less free time, and also student wouldn't have enough time to go spend with there family.

If the school board extended the school day by one hour and a half then students wouldn't have enough time to sleep because they have to do there homework , and that take probably one to two hours to finish there homework and then they will have to eat and get ready for bed.

I like have my free time to do mostly what I want to do but if the school board extended's the school by an hour and a half then we wouldn't have as much time for free time and we wouldn't be able to go outside and play with are friends or play video games, everything that you like to do will be shorter.

Do you like spending time with your family I like spending time with family but if the school board extends the school day by one hour and a half then you wont have as much time to be and spend with your family like going outside for a walk or playing games or going out places like to eat and those times are going to be making memories not being in school most of the time.

Thats why I think students shouldn't have school extended one hour and a half so they can have more time to do there homework and have more time to sleep, and so that they can have enough time to play video games and play outside with there friends , and finally so they can spend time with there family and do fun activities with them.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5

First reason, why I agree on what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. I think if you don't work hard for what you want,you will never accomplished it. Also believe in yourself and be confident, if you have skills use them. However, someone people have skills, but are not confident with their self. Practice or training will help you be successful.

Second reason, why I agree on what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. In my experienced I wasn't confident I would be shy to present my project. Although, I got my first job and helped me a lot with my fear. Now when my teachers asks who wants to present I will raise my hand first, so I can get over it.

Lastly, why I agree on what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. In my second experienced I was good at algebra and my other subjects, but my junior year I gave up when my grades dropped to a zero. In my second semester i started bringing my grades to at least a C, to make my mom proud. Until this day I feel proud of myself too.

Everyone should know what he/she want to be so they must prepare them selves for what they need to be, like working hard in order to achieve development in there ways. I want to tell about my friend Generic_Name that he is an engineer, he use be one those people that they think they can't do any thing in lives to find the way of success but he went for it to get it, thats way he is an excellent example for me. That makes me feel like it is your life, it is your choices just find it out whatever you want.

I think whoever believed to themselves and to the ability that they have they defiantly feel more strong in there goals. Also every one knows that when you have a problem do not complain just ask for help like me, when I was in Tenth grade I had a lot of issues the most important one is the school that I don't want to be in school because I feel that is just not going to work for me but I was wrong because I did ask for help from my teachers they provide me very helpful in formations. Some people might disagree with with me because they think asking for help can't solve all of the problems, but they are wrong because everyone need help no one is prefect.

As we know to confide in your self you need to toil hard a lot and you must tolerate more trouble that they are coming in your way. Of cores noting is easy but also is not that much hard that you should give up for it, so the more education that you have the more happier you will be in the future like my favorite soccer player Ronaldo he had a very hard live but he did find his goal and now he demonstrated him self to everyone.

In conclusion whoever try to do something in the lives like working hard on there goals, having enough confidence and tried to achieve them they well be successful.

Career experience is important to human society because it is needed in order to earn money. Some school provide programs that have different career. Student can have experience on what is like in the outside world. Without the help of the school program lot of student have difficulty on finding jobs.

Graduating early means that a student have master they're learning. They have the opportunity to start there career that they enjoy and have the requirement. Pre-AP classes, also advance learning can give students scholarship. Pre-AP classes means learning College while in High School.

Recommendation also falls on the same place as graduating early and career experience. When a student have master there learning they get to go to a special school that is more advance than regular school. They have reach the point where they succeed in learning.

To success you have to fail many times as you need to the same thing so you can get it right and success on in. Success is the desire of outcome in many goals in life, is the gaining of wealth and fame,

Success is to attain desire of doing what you like even know you are going to have to fail on it many times doing in it.

Success consists of going from failure to failure because nothing is perfect in life. During life you are always going to have ups and downs everyday, you are going to lose people because you might be doing something that they don't like or maybe You might be facing some obstacles that stops you from success and doing what you like. During success you are going to lose your enthusiasm in what you are trying to success in. You are going to start thinking i can't do this because i have done it many times and i always fail on it or i can't do this because my friend's and family members say i can't do it because when i do it i always comes up wrong.

Failure consists in falling to do something,it consists in the inability to do something or perform To success you are always going to fail and fail and fail till you get it right. you are going to face many difficulties doing what you like or the choices that you make but in the end there is going to be a purpose for what you are doing. You are not going to success on something right away when you know is the first time you are doing it ,

you have to take steps by steps to do it. there are so many things that are going to be wrong, they are going to be times that you are going to fail on what you are doing. there are going to be times where people are going to try to put you down and tell you that you can't do it just because its your first time trying it and you fail it in your first time. And your enthusiasm is going to come down and down each day for everything that people tell you. but you have to always keep your enthusiasm up.

Because enthusiasm consists in strong and a warm feeling that tells you that you re always have to keep strong and keep your head up in what you are doing.

""success consists of going from a failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm""is one of the Quotes you always have to keep on mind when you are doing something the first time. Ia the quote that you have too keep on mind when people tells you that you cant do anything because you fail it your first time. is the quote you have to keep on mind when you fail the first time and the the second time you got it right. thats where you are going to known the meaning of the quote. and you are going to see that all hard work you have done it was for a purpose to success more in life. maybe you might lost people during that battle but when you know the meaning of the quote and you understand it you are going to know that everything was for a purpose in life and after all you when through you success a lot in your life.

The first step of a person toward sucsses is school, and it is the golden part of our life, and to make it more enjoyable and comfortable for a student, school and teachers let us do some educational and exciting drama role plays, do a funny science experiment, and let them play their favorite instrument.

Today, we got some talented actors,comedians, actresses and etc, but they were also students in a time and were sitting on the chairs that we are sitting now. They did their best, try hard, participate in role plays in school, and now we can see were are they now. We can also reach there, and a best way to reach there is to participate in role plays in school, and improve our self from now. However, participating in role play is really fun and enjoyable. Role playing make us improve our daring to stand on podium and represent our self, and improve our emotions. By doing role play we can make people happy, and making someone happy is the biggest joy.

The technology and science has developed a lot and experiments are done day by day, and no one wants to stop these experiments. So for that now we want students to learn how to do experiments, and to make them more attractive toward science, we give them some fun and safe experiments such as:making rainbow in air, mixing colors or maybe disappearing coin, which increases their attention and focus on science, and it is actually fun to do these, and our big reason to do this is they are the future.

Every student has got a hide talent in their self such as; some students can play music, may draw, or maybe athletic, but these talents are not hidden for always these talents will get appeared sometime. The most popular talent among students is music. Because music directly touch your heart, and make you focus on it. Music have a lots of types it could be happy, sad, angry and etc, and it make you feel like that. We hear music everywhere on TV, in music class,and etc. When we hear music we get our emotions out and make our mind light, and we enjoy that.

At last, I think school is a place of learning, if someone want to learn something he always enjoy everyclass and get something learn from it. We should always enjoy at school and learn something.

Schools that allow students make more short their school years, if better for most of students who want get their diplomas, enter college, and start a career. Students who have a lot responsibilities and their want a diploma. These program is good to make steps in life. I think college do not have a specific age, just with your goals to make everything without leave school is strong enough to make a year early.

Those plans do not make problem, if just a way to finish what you want many people admire those people and see their potential. when a student have a early year because want a start to make a goals. If you see, passed, and remember high school lesson you will be fine, if you study and make your task these option will be good. Many reasons that take people to get these program, if because they usually do not have enough money, have to work, and need to study at the same time, everyone do not have the same opportunity opt for study during summer or online classes.

If you analyze students work after school, they want to get a diploma and make a force one year, when they make get one year less that say you are study and passed your classes different can be when teachers give you a year when you don't know nothing and teachers approve your year that's different go college when you have no idea how react to many classes than you never see or never show during the period of high school, the students that study during summers or in the evenings are focus in their classes that's because they finish fast and go college to involve in a new goal.

Example if you go school and need to work you'll to opt for study in summer or in the evenings that's your best option, students follow to take courses because it's a better idea maybe do not be the same learning, but with effort you can advance. Is not important how many years do you spend in high school, the think is what is your percent of each class. how you can involve in college: studying, focus, and remember what you see or learn.

In conclusion each student have different way to think how want to study and how many time want to spend in high school. Most students who take this decision if because they have to work and can spend much time, and they sacrifice some summers or evenings to get close their goals and each one do what is more beneficiary for their way.

I think is good because if they have any emergency in home they do not going to dismiss any classes they can take classes from home they have already tools do not needed to go outside they have everything in home, and the teacher they do not need to wake up early everyday, and also some family they are going to agree because now they do not are going to think every time how is my daughter or my son if they are safe or if they are in trouble.

the bad things that if they going to give to all the students to take classes from only or video confederation some students they not going to do their work. in some others parts they do not have any internet or money to buy a computer they do not have opportunity that the others person have, also the teacher do not have any jobs they are going to need they works back, and some family they do not need to send to school to their sons because they do not have many or they want their son to work. Is very different have the people think is hard to take decision.

if they are old they can choose what they want, they have to think very careful if they said yes they want to take class form online , is going to be more easy from them because they do not have a job or they do not have to take care, they can do it they have a lot of time in the world if they do not have any computer thats is going to be a really good problem form them because they do not have school open or they do not have the materials they want for learn,

they have to look for job but sometimes if your looking for a job they need to know how you was in school they need to see you record, you are going to need in the future.

If you are going to say no because we need to learn something, we do not have any money to pay to go to school theirs so many ways to go to school their have school that are free you do not need to pay anything, just you need is go to school everyday, and do not get in trouble. Is good idea if they do this in college for students they work they know, they have more responsibility.

If you put a child with computer is going to be more concentrated in computer and maybe they going to have problems with their eyes or any problem when their grow up.

if is a old is more easy from them because they brain is more they can understand and they do not have any issues to work in the computers.

so is bad idea that they students take class form online they do not have any money or they do not work. ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0
7680EF5AD3CB,"I believe students should not be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class. Therefore, it should be an elective. Not every student is excellent in the same things. However, taking a required class a student may not desire or need in the future can cause a student to fail. I believe students should not be required to take any of those classes because it's pointless, unfair, and not important.

To begin with, it should be an elective because not every student will need any of those classes to become a succesful person. Other students may want something dissimilar for their future that has nothing to do with singing, art or drama. It's also not helping a student to become smarter or to learn more. It's no where near educational related. It wouldn't be entertaining for students who do not want to take the class.

The second reason I certainly believe it is unfair to make it a requirement because it can cause them to fail and hold them back from graduating. It also shouldnt be a class that should hold you back from moving forward on to college. Students would feel as if it were a pathetic reason for them to repeat a grade over a class that is useless.

In conclusion, I believe that it should not be required classes to take. it's not important for students to take any of those classes. It's not a class that will help or provide a student to get a job. Majority jobs don't require for you to have any of those classes.                      ",3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5
76E5D0DEC30A,"People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. There is a quote that says, ""If you want to go fast go by yourself, but if you want to far go with someone else"". As the quote says, I think that it's very important to have someone to guide us throughout the course of our lives. I agree that seeking for guidance from experts to make wise decisions can have a great impact in our lives. Experts and authorities can provide us with advices to make good decisions in life and accomplish our goals more easily.

First of all, having someone to guide you throughout the decisions you make in life could help you accomplish a goal a lot easier. For example, when I was in middle school I used to think that doing individual work was faster and easier. However, I noticed that most of my classmates who worked in groups finished all the assignments in less time than I did. This experience showed me the importance of always having someone to give you their opinion to accomplish a goal quickly and avoid wasting your time. Thus, seeking for guidance from experts can help you achieve any goal you set in life and avoid wastig your time on making wrong decisions.

In addition, you will learn and gain experience if you have someone expert to guide you. For example, having an expert guiding you will allow you to see his different points of view and learned from his teachings. This will allow you to learn from his teachings and experiences and reflect about them. Furthermore, relying on with an expert will give you the chance to learn new lessons and in the future give you the opportunity to make your own decisions. Finally,

you will learn how to make wise choices by learning from the lessons that an expert or authority could offer you.

Some people say that having someone telling you what to do will limit you from choosing what's best for you. For instance, when I was 10 years old I really wanted to make my own decisions that I thought were best for me. In whatever manner, I rarely got to choose my own decisions because my brother was always there telling what decisions to make. As I grew older I understood that my brother was just guiding me through the right path. Because my brother had experienced many of the situations I went through, he was able to help me and in many occasions avoid me from failing. Therefore, experts and authorities will be there to not let you fail and always look for what's best for you.

In conclusion, seeking from guidance from experts may not give you the freedom to make your own decisions, but it will help you accomplish your goals rapidly and efficiently. Since experts have already experienced many rough situations in life, they will know how to make decisions that will benefit us in the best way. Furthermore, in the course of the path with an expert guiding you, you will learn a lot of things that will help you make better choices. Finally, you will avoid wasting a lot of your life's time trying to follow your own instincts and ideas. ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5

77FAA33476CA,"Why does most people want multiple advice when they are seeking for advice? As human beings we all go through hard times in life because that is how life works. When we go through those hard times we want to ask for help from maybe a friend, family, or just anyone that is close to you and you know them very well. Seeking for advice does not only mean you are having trouble with something. Asking for advice can also mean asking someone if you are making the right choice. Something that we have to remember is that not evryone is not ok with asking people for their advice. There are many reasons why most people are afraid of asking their friends or family for advice is because they are scared they might judge them or laugh at them. Something else most people are afraid is their family or friends might think they are crazy or they are just making things up. For my final reason I think this reason is the really importent in my opinion because this is what a lot of time kids, teens, go through is people might think they are doing this for attention. Now by attention I don't mean something as so they could get the parents attention I mean they might be asking for your advice because you are the parent and you know what's right for your own kid and you want to always make sure you support them no matter what.

What I am writing about is something that I have been through in life. There were a lot of times in my life where a lot of my friends were going through really hard times in life and most of the pain they were going through was their families not caring or thinking that their kid is crazy and they just want attention. The truth is if you wanna help your friends or even family members you need to give them the right opinions that you have and help them find other people who can help them and give them their opinions. Something else that is really helpful when seeking multiple opinions is, it helps the person make a better choice. Again this might not be so easy for the person, but it opens more doors for them and it makes them feel like they do have a way out of their problems.

In 6th grade I had a really great friend she came from a different countrie and she was from Generic_City, and had no idea how to speak english. She did knew some words like how to say hi or say her name, but that was all she could speak. After a couple of mounths in school I noticed that she was having a very hard time in school because many people bullied her. Everyday when she came to class she was always sad or she was always in the office. I knew that my friend was going through something so I tried talking to her and helped her by giving my opinions of what she can do and what she should do in order to slove her problems. By giving her many opinions she was able to overcome her problems and she was always happy and she was starting to speak a little more english and it was like as if she was a whole new person.

This might not be easy for many people who has a close friend that is going through something and they don't want to talk about it because most of the time they are shy or they don't want people to know. Always keep in mind that just because that person does not want to tell you anything does not mean they are ok or they don't need help, always try to talk to them and tell them that you care and you want to help them. This can also build up the persons confidence and it helps them to open up more with their feelings and they can try to talk to their family members or their friends more often.

Now why is Seeking Multiple opinions really importent? Well I just told you there are many reasons why it's importent. It helps people to know they matter and there is a sloution to their problems no matter what they are going through. It opens more doors for them, and helps them know that they do matter and they should talk to people they can trust. Something that parents need to keep in mind is that when your kid asks for advice don't think they are crazy or they just want attention because that is not the point, they just want help with what they are going through. Again by attention I don't mean something as so they can get the parents attention I mean they might be asking for your advice because you are the parent and you know what's right for your own kids and you want to always make sure you support them no matter what.

Because helps me get better at things ,it teaches me new things that I didn't even know about, and also helps me grow smarter and as a better person. Learning from someone like my Dad.

Hearing wisdom from my Dad will definitely make me a better and smarter person. Because it will make me motivated to think like him and be like him . It will also make me work and study harder so I can get to where his telling me to. And not only I could be like my Dad one day I could probably be a better person and smarter person than him.

Learning new things from someone that has an experience like my Dad can help me have more better ideas about what I'm doing . And it gives me an open mind about new ideas that I didn't even know about. It also helps me create new ways how to do stuff. And will also gives me better techniques and more ideas. So in the future I can try to change and try different things from what I have learned from my Dad.

It's also really important for my Dad to give me his wisdom, Because I can't imagine doing stuff without someone helping me on things that I don't even know about. It just helps me to stay more focus in my work by just hearing from someone Like my Dad. It makes me want to try harder than other people and be better than them.

Everyone is not perfect in this world and everyone definitely needs helps on something it doesn't have to a big thing it can be a very small things.

One day my coche tells me that there is a professional soccer try out next week and he want me to get ready. So he gives me a schedual on what i should be doing to get fit. Everyday i have to eat right and train hard. I did all of those things somedays i did not want to train and just start eating unhealthy but i fought through it. Try out day comes and i was ready as i will ever be. we started out with warm ups and went to drills. I was amazing. i was like the best player at the fiald. at the end of the day they gathered every body up and called all the people that made it. I was not one of them. I have failed to become a pro soccer player. Now this is the part where enthisiasm playes a role. I can eather stop playing soccer and choes a diffrent routh or i can pick my head im and try again.

78B89BF70AE8,"I am agree with Emerson's statement about individuality because in this world you have to be yourself and if doesn't mater how you are, you have to be yourself even if the world is against, because the world doesn't change you. You change the world, and you have to be sure what you want and what you do not want, you have to be yourself, you can be different, the different it is not bad, because sometimes ""Be like others is do not be no one"".

For those reasons is why you have to be yourself, you have to follow your dreams and you have to fight for them, don't let the people throw you, and if you felt, you have to get up and keep fighting for your dreams. Remenber if you felt 99 times, you have to get up 100 times, and never let that people and the world convert you in something that you don't want it, in something that you don't love it, in something that you don't wish or something that you don't enjoy.

Also in my life some people tried to change myself, but I always try the way to carry on and keep fighting for my drams, and one of my dreams was traveled to this country, and some people told me that I can not do it, even some people told me that I will die on the long way from El Salvador to United States.

That was a long and a hard way, a diifficult trajectory, but I did my objective. It was not easy, because sometimes I had to sleep in the desert or in some mountains, so the polices can not found me.

Also sometimes I had to move the one place to another placer and some pelaple and me did it acrros the cars, but we had to hide on the trunk of the cars, and I remenber we was like 12 persons on a trunk car. It was not easy but I did it.

I remenber some days that I had to walk for hours to be in some place close the border, and also some days that i didn't eat nothing because I didn't have food, and in some ocassions I feel that I can't no more, but on my mind I had a objective and a dream. My objective and my dream were stay in this country and to provide help to my family.

But in my mind I am keeping have some objectives and dreams, and one of my objectives is makes to my parents proud of me and one of another objective for me is be a example to my brothers, I wanna give it to them the best of the world.

My brothers and my parents are the reason why I work hard everyday, and I try to do the best on school, I try to be a really good students but sometimes it is hard for me, because the languages are different, so I try everyday to learn English, so everything can be easier and that can help me a lot.

You always have to be yourself because a more than a person goes to like you, so just be you and don't let the world change you. Keep dreaming and get foccus on your objectives.

Don't be afraid in a world that is constantly trying to ,ake you something else, just be you and don't worry be happy, enjoy the little big things that the world give it to you like friends and family, enjoy with people that you love, and always be thankful with everyhing, if doesn't matter if it is good or bad, everything happen for a reason.",3.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5
78DD2317E359,"What Minister Churchill is trying to say is that going from failure to success is not gonna be easy in life. What could they do to reach their career and have success? People will agree with this statement. Not everyone is gonna succeed in life, we all make mistakes. People just got to try harder even if it takes years to achieve. Failure is not the end of the world, people just got to find what is best for them. Going from failure to success in life is not easy, but they just got to have the potential to reach that goal.

First, some people may tell others that going from failure to success is a good thing. For example, my friends told someone that playing basketball is not a good sport for him, but overtime he has gotten better at basketball. Most people in the world are gonna say ""practice makes perfect."" Another example is that my sister wanted to go to UVA, and she studied hard to get into that college, my family thought they wouldn't accept it, but a few weeks later, they accepted her in UVA. Things aren't gonna be easy, people just got to understand that it is life, we just got to work harder.

On the other hand, most people in the world experience this. There is not one person in the world that didn't have any issues throughout their whole life. Even in school, it is very unlikely to find someone that is not having a hard time with there classes. Everyone was not smart when they were born, people got to work for it to get smarter. Here is another example, my Math and History have good grades, but my English and Science don't have good grades, so not everyone is gonna have good grades, people have strengths and weaknesses, they just got to study and work because not everyone is perfect.

In addition, some others may say that going from failure to success is a waste of time. Others say that it won't help their career in the future. People think that there is a lot of information in school, college, and even a job that they have to go through just to have success in life. They also say that they have to work hard to pay for their house, their bills, health insurance, car insurance, and even for their family. The people in the world that say that it is a waste of time are the people that can be homeless or the people that just have no life at all.

Lastly, the reason why that everyone should always go from failure to success is because it's gonna make people feel good about there selves. Another reason why you should be successful is if people finish everything they need for their career, then they don't have to deal with it in the future than having to deal with it later. Also, it is a good idea if they study and learn the materials they could accomplish. Even if people don't succeed in life it is fine because they still have a chance, all they got to do is to study hard and work hard for it because in the future they will not regret it.

78EA0C3715FE,"In most cases student are committed to a career at a young age by school or their parents to guide them early. This could be a benefit for them, since they are young and have the capacity to learn faster, also if they are in high school it would be good for them to be guided at a young age to help them on a career they would like to take, and when they go to college,they don't find the stuff they are going to see complicated, and they are somewhat prepare and have an idea of what they are going to learn if they choose to go to college.

I think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because it helps students prepare their mentality, knowledge, and give them an idea of what they are going to see, and focus on the career they want to choose. Most of the time students do not want to commit to a career at a young age because they are either so stressed out from school and they feel like they cannot decide what career they want to take or because they feel like it is not really going to help them much on what they choose. Some students don't know or can't decide what career they want to take, and that is not okay because they most know by the time they are at least in 11th grade, so school can give them the appropriate classes to prepare them for that career, and those classes to help them when they go to college. In fact, not going prepare to college it can be complicated to students and probably stressful since they have no idea what so ever of what they are going to see or learn. For example, when you know what career you want to take since the beginning of high school and you are focus on that career, and you take the classes that will help you be prepare for that career, when you go to college you have an idea, and you are not going to be as stress as other students who didn't want to take advantage of that.

I would personally take the chance so I can be prepared for college, I think if I take classes that will help me be prepared it would obviously be good for me. I already know what career I want to take and the classes that are recommended for that specific career, and it is actually good because I can learn more about that career, I know that I am capable for the career I want and that it will not be hard for me since I always liked what I want to do which is about computers, and technology related. My parents also recommend me to commit to my career at young age so I can learn and practice my skills. Some students don't have the support of their parents like I do and they just decide to finish high school and be done which is not really good if they want to get a job that will give them a lot of money, and most of the jobs requires you to have a degree of some sort or specific for that job.

There are jobs that don't ask for anything just the high school diploma, but those jobs don't really pay that much, and they are kind of heavy, not all of them but most of them. Some jobs like construction, and plumber don't require that you need to have a college degree just the high school diploma, and this jobs also pay really good, but they are really tiring and heavy, mostly construction that you have to be outside in that hot temperature or cold. If you compare this jobs with like a being a doctor, dentists, or technician; this jobs requires you to have a college degree, and you have to go to college for either 2,3,4 or 5 years so you can get the degree of any of this careers, and they pay you a lot and it is not heavy and you don't expose yourself to hot or cold temperatures, and that is a benefit for you if you want to have a really sotf or calm job.

Basically if you know what career you want to take, and you prepare yourself like taking all your classes, and what you need, you should be good for the most part. Not all the time going to college to get a degree so you can get a job is the only way to get money or make a living out of it. For example, you can be a singer, and if your music is loved by most of the people you can success and make money out of it by selling albums or promoting your songs to different platform in internet. Playing sports like soccer, basketball, tennis, or baseball can give you a chance to make money, for example, you can have a career out of that, but you most good for big teams to pick you up and pay you which payment is a lot if you make it to the big teams.

This doesn't always work for everyone only for the talented ones that were meant to be good at each of the careers. For example, I like to play soccer, but I am not good enough to make a career out of it, so I decided to finish my studies, follow my career, and get the job that I would like. Some students finish high school and then they decide to do this type of careers which sometimes work for few of them, they reached their goals and sometimes they don't even finish high school, but if they can't accomplish this, then they have all they need which is their diploma or they can continue with their studies to get the job they would like to have.

In conclusion, is a good thing that students commit to a career early so they can be prepared for the future this will also help them develop their capacity when they go to college where things will get a little bit hard for them. Most of the students do this and they success in their careers, I would to the same because I know high school will help me get prepare for college, and I don't have to feel the pressure of not knowing anything all, I already have a little bit of understanding and knowledge.",4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0
79D634E4575F,"Some schools of the United States are looking forward to the day that students will attend classes from home by way of online. Dispite this exciment it can be not beneficial for some students in the way of learning. Making students to attend classes online happens will change many students lives. Although some say that offering online classes by the school would be more beneficial, actually it won't be beneficial for students who wants to attend online classes offered by the school because it will require more work for students and students will have less interaction with people face to face.

Those who believe schools should offer online classes have reasons. They believe that students will have flexible schudeles during the day. It will help students to relieve strees and to work if they have a part-time job. They also think that students will become more responsable attending classes from home. Doing their work in their own will develop a self- decipline.

One of the main reasons why schools of the United States shouldn't offered students to attend classes online from their is because it requires more work from the students. For example, my friend Generic_Name. He is attending one class online from his home. He says that he doesn't have too much time to practice a hobby or do something else because he needs to do a lot of assignments for his online class. Sometimes he has to do two homeworks each day just for one class. Also his class online requires to write a lot, such as essays or read books. Essays and reading books counts as a big percent of his grade. And it doesn't include the warm-ups and classworks during the class. Requiring this ammount of work schools shouln't offered these classes online because too much work is assigned just for one class. If students want to take other classes they won't have time to do it. Like my friend Generic_Name his life has become very busy since he stated taking this online class offered by his school.

In fact, students become very wird because they have less interaction with people face to face. For instance, my counsin Generic_Name she used to be a girl that really liked to interact with people. One day her school offered her some online classes to take. She said yes. Well in a short period of time her parents starting to notice that she was becoming a very shy and wird person when time was passing and continuing taking clases online. Later, her parents found out that her online clases made her become a wird child because of the less interaction she had with people. Schools should privide students a diferent method to help students to attend their classes becuase online classes keep students from the real world and their interaction with people. Avoiding classes online will reduce the percent of students to become wird and shy and to have a better relationship with people.

In conclusion, many schools of the United States should stop offering students online classes becuase it requires a lot of work for the students. These classes just make students's life busier than what they expected. Also, students are afraid to interact with other people face to face because they spend most of time in their computers. The real world need students who like to interact with people not shy students. Students don't see benefits of attending online classes, instead it just make their life difficult in many ways.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5

In my opinion i would say success isn't as better as failure. They are both a team. While i agree this is why i pick Ralph statement is cause the un expected always comes in lfe.  ",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,2.5
7A552DBA7D71,"The effects of allowing students to have and use cellphones in the classroom is not listening to what the teacher has to say, not using it property for your educational purposes, and disturbing the class from learning. The students with not pay attention to what the teacher, because they are so busy in their cellphones. Some students decide not to use it for educational purposes and uses it for other purposes.

If you do not use your cellphone for educational purposes you would not know noting from school to know about. You can get in some problem for not using it for education. They should not have it out unless the teacher say you can for your assignment. This is why people should not use cellphones in school for these purposes.

Thirdly, people will disturb other people from trying to learn with there devices that can cause a disruption. The cellphones will ring and stop everyone from learning, because they will pay attention on whose phone is ringing. You will not be able to know how to do the work if do not know what to do. you are disturbing your classmates that are trying to learn the material they need so they can do something with there lives.

7C2650EEA2B6,"Do you think a three month break is too long ? Some professors feel that summer break is too long and students are most likely to forget everything they have learned when they return to school. However, both professors and students deserve a nice, long break because ten months of high school can cause tons of stress, people get to spend more time with their families, and last but not least, students can take classes during the summer if they want to graduate early.

First, most students want to attend to good colleges, therefore, they take advanced classes in high school in order to receive more credits. Teachers give more assignments in advanced classes and the work is much harder than course classes. Students often have to stay up late to finish school work. In addition, with little amount of sleep can cause students serious stress. For instance, my cousin once took six college classes in her junior year of high school. She never had much time to eat nor sleep, to the point where she passed out. My family had to take her to the doctors for a checkup. They said that she had stress issue and it may take a long time for her to recover. Luckily, with three months of summer break, she became better.

Second, some students don't want to spend four years in high school when they have an opportunity to graduate early. In order to do so, they must take all of the requirement courses. Though, not all courses are available during the school year, however, students can take it in the summer. For example, my best friend, Generic_Name, took English 11 over the last summer, so she could graduate early from high school and soon become a nurse. She learned everything she needed for the tests within two months of summer school,

Third, many people love to spend time with their families. Summer break would be an awesome opportunity for both teachers and students to go on vacations with their loved ones. They can travel to different states or even countries if they like. In the summer of 2015, my family and I had a great time in Generic_City. I got to experience many amazing things, it was the best summer I have ever had. Though, the most wonderful time of the year is summer, however, some argue that there should be year round schools and only three to four weeks of break in the summer.

In conclusion, all students and teachers, including staff members deserve a nice, long summer break. Most people agree that school is very stressful, therefore, a three month break is not too long. Some says that when one is stress out, they can't think nor do things well. On the other hand, when their mind is relax they will achieve successful things in life. ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5
7C6ED140EF65,"There are many that have responsibility in the world that we have to do and with those responsibility there will be many challenges that we as humans have to overcome to theses things in one way or another. A city council is debating adoption of a 10P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers. Dear city council I find it amazing that you are doing this but I also do disagree mainly because. For example, we teenagers have to some activities after school or we have jobs and if its not because of those things its because were stuck in traffic. I do understand the reasoning of why we shouldnt be driving at these hours of the night It's mainly because we're exhausted at that point we can't focus that much. To say something we teenagers we can stay awake much more longer than you adults why do you think we stay up for so long its not because we're bored no its because we want you to see that we can hold our own wait and we stay up for our jobs and dont sleep until we go home when we get home because in truth we can hold ourselves now.

Dear to the city council I actually do think we should have teenagers off the road before 12AM. For example, thats when people that are under the influence are mainly on the road and depending on where you are there could be deer. There are lots of dangerous things in the night that no one can see or even some dangerous people that might harm us in the night. There are a lot of bad things on the road at night and you as the driver could of course from your long drive an turn tired and maybe crash. In conclusion I see why you dont want us to go driving at 10PM or even past midnight because of there being dangerous things in the night but I do also hope that you know that we dont stay up because of random things but we're actually staying up important things like our jobs or after school activities and that we will be very careful in the night because we know of the dangers of the night.",3.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,2.5
7CAFF57E1775,"Dear principal,

I have heard of the school cafeteria's plan to change to a new healthier school lunch. And as a junior in this school,I take the position that this new dynamic idea to change the school's lunch menu is a bad idea. So I have decided to share my thoughts for the development of this school and with our health. I believe that keeping our school's lunch menu is a good idea. I know that my opponents would argue with me regardlessly,because they would probably assume that our students have been eating the same food for too long and would definetely want to have a different versions of food,and get to explore their school lunch like other schools usually do. But when they detect my reasons,they would know for sure that the school's lunch is way better than they think it is.

My initial reason for not agreeing to this change is that it would eradicate some student's favorite cafeteria foods, especially me,There are a lots of food currently in the cafeteria that are so good, clean and healthy.

they are also enough food for everyone to eat, so changing the menu wouldn't be necessary, it would be a waste of time and money. the school has got a bunch of stuff to focuse on. American's have this quote that "" if you have lemons make lemonades"" meaning we should make the best out of what we have by embracing it not changing it.

In additon, the current school's lunch menu is technically healthy, I have this extraordinary thoughts in my mind because I haven't seen any student that has protested against the school's lunch, this means that the current school lunch is unique on it's own way. Also the school lunch is potentially some of the amazing healthy American foods.

Again,Most American foods are junky and cause students to gain weight chronically and gradually. But our current food consists of fruits,vegetables and also green salad which prevents the body from gaining too much weight and sustain the normal body weight. I have been eating our school's green salad for a while and l have seen some fantastic changes in my body and it is very impressive. So principal, dont you think that changing our school's cafeteria's lunch menu is a bad idea?

For instance, our school cafeteria's lunch has got protein,Vitamin D and my weight is intact, as far as our health is concerned, so take all of these reasons into consideration and figure out your final answer,I hope that you make the right choice for the school and l know that the school's improvement is your priority.

Thank you respectively,

7D98C85F9223,"Has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people's lives? Yes, people using technology on everyday bases can have negative effects on thier lives. For example, looking into your screen for long period of time can have negative effects on your eyes. Being on your phone everyday limits your time of socialing and having regular converstion with other people. technology can make you develop an ediction with your phone, video game, and computer making you unawere with what's happeing around the world. eventhoght technology has negative effects on you, sometimes technology can have positive effects on you and your everyday life.

For example, technology can help you keep and complite taskes in your everyday life. using your phone can alow you to do things like: order clothes, buy eddibles, talk with family and friends all over the world, watch movies, listin to music, playing games, remembering birhdays, and things you have to do in your long term plan. Getting things done just by your phone can make your life easier and stress free. In some cases technology is used more then to just watch movies and remebering birthdays, its used to save lifes and make new inventions.

For instance, older people with health problems use technology everyday, they depend on technology to safe thier lives. The technology that they have can alert and get the help the person needs without the person having to call or touch anything. people around the worls are using technology to help and make cure for people with health issues. some are using technology to make new inventions such as, self driving cars to make the world a better and safe place.

For students technology is very helpful they can use it in school to take tests, quizes, and classwork. They can use it at home to do homework and study. use it to reserch and watch visualy watch videos to help them understand things they don't know. help them communicate with teachers and other helpful resorces online. For home schooled students technology is very helpful, beacuse some student are able to learn and understand better if they got lessons online than in a classroom.

Moreover, technology is a very helpful thing it might have negative effects on you and your life if you use it in the wrong way but its very helpful in some cases, and people actually need technology to learn and live. Therefore, technology can benifit people in thier everyday life. technology isnt bad or have negative effects on you its the way you use technology.",3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
7E48A7A7B400,"When I was in elementary school, I've always wanted to have art lessons. Art is the lesson that I would like to share with elementary school students because it could help them in several different ways.

The first way art would help the students is by making them more patient. When you are doing art and using paints, sometimes you have to wait until it dries so you can add more details and etc, that is one way that art can help them be more patient. You have to be patient when you are making realistic drawings, because if you draw fast you might forget to add important details and the drawing may not come out as good as it would if you had drawn it with patience. Another way that it helps the students being patient is that they also sometimes might have to redraw it if the drawing does not come out as good as they thought it would, and that requires patience, especially if make a mistake when you are about to finish it. And also, when they are working in groups they might have to explain for the rest of the group what are their ideas and how they want to do the project, which also requires patience.

The second way art would be important to students is by making them more creative. When you are making art you have to be creative and think a lot. Being creative wouldn't only help them at school, it would also help their future. For example, if the student dream about their future, then it would help them to think more and be creative about what they want to do. Being creative would help them in several ways.

And lastly, art would help them be focused. When you are drawing you have to focus on what you are doing. If you lose the smallest bit of focus, you can make a mistake and might have to do everything again. Being a more focused person would also help them in life. And also, they woul need to focus in the directions when doing their work.

In conclusion, art would be helpful in several ways, It would help them to be a patient, creative, and focused person. Art would help them in life and school. It would help their future. This is why I would like to share this lesson with them.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0

I think students can be benefit because they can have more time, if they have job or they need an extra class but, they could not be or stay after school or they just cannot come to school for personals reasons I think those students can be benefit.

First,student from high school much of them have a job and they need take class at home just for three hours and then rest to get ready to their job. They also can have time to do homework it's how it can be easy for them to study more and have a grade and graduate.

Second, if they are almost to finish high school, but they just need a credit and they don't want to be in school just for one class they should take that class online and have more time;

it can be for homework or they go to visit another place but they cannot missing that class because they need that credit and grade for graduation. What about they can not stay after school but they need that grade they can take that online while they're at home.

Another reason why Robotics is a job for me to pursue, because it's all about coding. Furthermore, coding is basically you have to type in the words specifically. For example, Forward = (1). That means it tells the robot to move forward only one time. Also, coding is like math, you have to calculate what distance is the Robot is going to do and where it want to stop.

Another reason why Robotics is the one thing that I'd like to pursue is Building. Building the Robot is where you have to work with a team to make it happen, if you were to build it by yourself, it would take a long time to make, since it's only you and not 3 or 4 people helping you.

80EF60E3EA04,"One school activity that kids enjoy are field trips because it provides them a brake from school work and it gives them a opportunity to explore their surroundings. Teachers and students often get tired of being at one place everyday. Students are also constantly working and the only break they have is lunch and electives. The teachers also get brakes but they have their phones on them all day. Teachers and staff may feel stressed planing the trips but in the end i think they enjoy it just as much as the students.

Middle school is a stressful time. Students have to complete lots of work that isnt needed. They also have packets of homework to complete and the packets are usually due the next day. Teachers just hand out papers and papers of homework without thinking about it. meanwhile, students are trying to study for important stuff like tests,sols or exams. I try to complete all the work i have but it is hard when all the teachers are saying,'my work is more important.' We are constantly reviewing, working or studying and sometimes it's just too much. This is why we want to go on field trips or go outside more often.

Schools are not the most funnest place to be. Many schools, like Generic_School, are extremely stuffy and dirty. Being in a building that's stuffy all day makes many people annoyed. Everyday students asks to go outside. However, the teachers and staff always say no because the administrators wont allow it. My school has a outside siting area in the middle of the school but nobody gets to sit outside. Students often look forward to the end of the day or field trips because it gives them air and a chance to breath. Being outside or in a new location gives students the chance to get to know their surroundings. however, being controlled and forced to stay in one place makes them feel like prisoners. This is why students love field trips and new outdoor places.

In conclusion, the most enjoyed activity in schools are field trips because it gives them a breather and it gives them the opportunity to explore. Students and teachers should not have to be in a place like prison. I think there should be more field trips not just two a year.          ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0
81218F777A2F,"Energy should be conserve more because alot of people do not use alot of these particular items half of the time. It is better to save energy rather than waste. Like for eample, we use light everyday to see things around us so that we do not trip or bump into things. If not we wouldnt be able to see things near us. At times we take advantage way too much. Were wasting alot of light source that we hardly ever use at times. Therefor, were wasting alot of energy that we should not be wasting. Alot of people tend to go out to places to run some errands and leave there lights on for no reason or just keep the light on for no particular reason. The best way to save energy would be to turn off the light before you go out and not just leave it on because your just making your bills go up. When you do not even use it half of the time. It would help alot and keep you from wasting alot of money.

Second reason, would be us not recyling things that we drink or eat. We tend to just throw it in the trash instead of the recyling bin. Even in schools they have recyling bins but us people do not pay attention to it because it is nowhere to be seen. It would be better if the recycling bin was to be seen. I feel like people would use it and recycle more. Also will save resources that can be cleaned and used again. Rather than just using more products to make the particular object. Schools and other places should make an improvement and stop using alotof energy and resources and make it easier for the resources that are being used. Us people should recycle more and save light source and actually help the world be a better place and keep it clean and simple. If we were able to do that it would make everything else easier.

Overall, schools should not be extending it for two more hours. Reasons why is because teachers tend to use alot of paper to give students to work on. Most of the times teachers would not use front and back of the paper. They would always do work on seprate pices of papers and give them to the students. To make things easier for them would be to use front and back because there not using alot of paper. So that it can be graded on and be thrown out by the students. Students never like to keep paper with them when teachers grade them after. So alot of paper is going to waste for no reason. Teachers should consider of teaching students with technology and doing work on there rather then using alot of paper. Technology would help because trees would not be going to waste and harm the things around there surrounding just to make paper out of it. Alot of trees would be save and have alot of resources still. People should just think about the goods thing and the bad things about it. Like is it worth wasting all these resources rather than using technology.

There is advantages and disadvantages of extending school for two hours. The advantage would be students being able to learn more and have more time spent with their peers and teachers. Students would have more time to do work rather than doing it at home and struggling. It is better for them not to waste time and get the help they need. But, at the same time the teacher is giving them work which is bad in the way but good also . The work that is being given to them is not bad but the resources that makes is because of how it is made. Eventually, schools should just use technology and do all the work there. Students would be able to access it easier and teachers would not have to worry about the students losing work or having problems. Students would also be more entertain because all they like to do or be on is technology and it would help the teachers alot.

Overall this point, teachers or not just them should consider of managing the time they use on things that use alot of energy. It would make the world a better place and more healthier. Trees would not have to be cut down alot and affecting their surroundings. Basically would not cause pollution in the air and hurt things around it like for example animals .

In my point of view I have to agree on what Thomas Jefferson has stated. You can't accomplish something without working for it and I will be listing examples on why I believe in a strong way that if you keep doing something you'll be able to accomplish what you want.

My number one example is my parents, Of course its unthinkable that your parents want you to have the best future that you can get but have you ever asked on how they got to this point in life. My parents are heroes for me in a lot of ways but the most important one is how they never stay idle. they work nonstop to make sure my future is bright. They even left their home country so I can have a better life here, They never stayed idle even until this point and they've gotten pretty far.

Second example would be singers, In this day in age believe it or not singers have great influence in this world. That's because a lot of singers known to man never stopped singing or dancing. They always worked hard to become the number one or wanting to be someone in general that people would look up to. Like Micheal Jackson, Even when he sadly died to this day people still praise him for what he made in the pop music world. Or Snoop Dog and his ability to rap really fast which people gave him the title of rap god. There's a lot more people that have changed the world because of music but I think they had the highest impact.

Now the last example is company's and their founders per say. Car company's, or company's in general had or have someone who started it all, One big example would be Ellon Musk and his Tesla car company. After he made Tesla the best electronic car company to date he decided to keep moving forward with his plan to go all green. His made commuter vehicle and now his focusing on diesel trucks so there can be less pollution in the air and more safety for the drives. His making a lot of impacts in the world because his not just standing around waiting for someone else do it for him. I think I've said enough and stand by my opinion that if you are doing something you will accomplish what your wanting in the future like how this other people have just like Thomas Jefferson wrote.

827D807512AB,"churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? Success consists of going from failure without loss in enthusiasm. I think that churchill's is wrong about that failure of the plays in the pursuit of success because not many people are failure of there success and many people are in inspired from what they are going and so many people are pursing a failure.

Firstly, not many people are failure of there success. For example people that are failure is not succeeding in doing something else. Lets say that student that goes to school that they don't want to succeeded in there education. That they don't want there education for college or a university if they don't succeeded . Another example is if you are not succeeding then you can't do something just as outcome.

Secondly, many people are inspired from what they are going to succeeding. For instance people are are working or getting a job they have to be inspired of there job they have to succeeded in what they are going. They have to love they job or do a better to succeeded in there job. If you succeeded in your job you might get a raise.

Thirdly, so many people are pursing to failure. They don't want to pursuit anything because if they do then they are not succeeding in doing something else. for example if a students want to graduate on time with there class mates they he has to get good grade pass the sol then he has to succeeded in school. They have to be enthusiasm meaning they have to be inspired.

Iin conclusion Winston churchhill's is a failure of the plays in the pursuit because not many people are failure that who want to success and many people are inspired from want there are going and finally so many people are pursing to failure.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0

They wan't everyone to be kind and no wasting act of kindness. My oppinoion I wold at least do one to five act of kind ness a day to make someone happy. If you do a act of kind ness you might get some to say something good about to make you feel good. It is nice to do in genral. You can feel good if you gave some a complement of there self and make them feel good. You can make someone day because they might have had A bad day and you gave them a complment and that make them feel good. I think the auther made this becuase they can make people feel good. The ancinent greek is relly old and they were doing alot of act of kind ness. The ancient greek story teller said no act of kindness no act of kind nees shoud never be wasted no matter how small. I think Aesop is a ancient greek king That can tell people to do act of kind ness. He said in his words NO! act of kind ness should never be wasted for no small reason I think that means that evreyone should do a serten amont of acts of kind ness a day like I said that I woud do do like one to five act of kind ness a day to make someone happy.

82BA3E4396CC,"Imagine you are going to a diffferent country, and you do not know anything about that country or how it works and you have only heard people talk about it or may have seen it in movies. But you know you have to go there because the education is not well supported by the government, and the president is corrupt and does not care about its people in your country so that is your option to be something in life. It is good to hear what other people have to say even their personal opinions because you may never realize that you may be in their position in the future struggling.

Knowing as a kid that you have to listen to adults, but you may think it is not neccessary, I have thought the same thing before I was a teenager and before coming to the USA from Generic_City only knowing 1 word in the new language that you are going to be using the rest of your life everyday. I was born in Generic_City 2006 and moved to Generic_City I grew in a town where snitching and getting into peoples life is a daily routine because people don't finish school bacause they are lazy and others who work to feed their family and never get an education and if you get to finish everything there arent many job options to enforce your career or to make money for yourself so you have to travel to the larger cities for work and you only get paid for day not by hours unlike the US.Everybody tells you to go to the US but everyone gives up because getting paper is super hard and stressful, the chance for you to get accepted are low so people just stay and get a job at a small store until they die and it is sad because they can't reach all the goals they wish they could achieve in such a developing country.

Since I was 4 years old I wished to always go to the US because at that age I already knew I had no future back there and I used to watch tv a lot and the US looked like a promising place to live at and there we're more job opportunities and I could be what I wanted thats what everybody told you back in Generic_City, and some of it was true you get more chances to be what you want and not end up as a ""vago"" and not be a blockhead. People used to say the language was their biggest obstacle even my mom said the same thing well I never thought I would come to the US of A I guess until my mom met my stepdad who brang us here but before comeing we spent a whole month and more on papers before coming to the US.It took a lot of money, work, and time which was the reason I did not want to come to the US because it frustrated me seeing my mom stressed out about some papers that we needed to come here where I now stand.

Once I came to Virginia my mom, and stepdad told me to work hard because the language would be my struggle as well as his when he came to the US around 20 years ago. My first day of school I got in trouble in less that 1 hour and 27 minutes into the day, because some kids decided to bully me and thought I wouldn't say a word because I didn't know how to even say good morning in english well this all happened inside the hallway bathroom I beat them up because I totally forgot fighting was not allowed in the schools and they said ""He started it he was trying to hurt us we we're just trying to use the bathroom and he came out of nowhere"" and I got in trouble I wanted to say something but I only knew one word in english which was ""hi"". My school was Generic_School which I used to get taken out of my class for a teacher to teach me english she told me I was the fastest english learning student she had in her entire career as a teacher which I was already starting to speak the language 6 months into the year with no background of me speaking the language in Generic_City. I was in fourth grade by the time I could comprehend almost what everyone was telling me and all the kids became my friends even the ones who had bullied me a year ago. I had struggles with my homework a big struggle my stepdad would come from work late and stressed out and he would not have much patience while helping me with my work and I would say I learned the language because I needed to become independent as soon as possible because it was too much stress on my back not being able to do anything on my own. I came to a whole different world where the school system was different even a math problem was different than what I used to learn back there I was 8 when I came.

Something I really like i the fact that there is snow here in the US because there was no snow where I used to live, as well as water I noticed that there was water everyday and all night here in the United States. Water is something that lots of developing countries may not have while others have it for their wet weather and jungle like land where it always rains. In the town I lived you only used to get water for 2 hours of the day and not every day.      ",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5

First, People like to be idle with other people like in some works when they do not want to employed in his works just because they have a inability personal but if people want to accomplish. They can doing something like in his home or a thing easy that they can make, for follow living but some people something just think about what they want to make his purpose but they never do something.

Second, People can follow his purpose and doing something wonderful, but if they do not are idle for example in some works like that people who work. in some place the boss are idle and that do that people leave that job for his idle personality it is wonderful if people do something good for his life because, some people do things bad and that happen that in some place never proposed something.

Third, In some place or country are bad, because people do not accomplish to have a good country because they do not do something good, for example something steal person, and happen that country accomplish a purpose we need to accomplish what we can or what we what for ours life, and do not be idle because are idle do not help for make something better for ours life, so we need to have patience with want we accomplish.

I believe that classes like arts, music and drama should be elective to the studnets. It is not required for every students to take every classe. Students should have their own rights to choose what classes they want and what they don't want. I believe that it is a waste of time to force those students to take classes they are not interested in. Instead of forcing students to take every classes, it is better to give importance to that one particular class that the student is interested in.

Students should have their own rights to choose what classes they want and what they don't want. Schools where they allow students to choose classes they want are likable. Students prefer to go to that school where they can choose classes as they want. They don't prefer to go to those schools where the students are forced to take every classes. If students are to take every classes, it might be too much for them to handle.

I believe that it is a waste of time to force those students to take classes they are not interested in. It is not only a waste of time for students, but it is a waste of time for teachers who works so hard. If a person is not interested in something, you should not force them to like it. Classes like music, art and musics are extra activites. They are important for us but not that important where studnets have to be forced to take every classes. If students are to take every classes, they might loose interest in that particular class they were interested in.

Instead of forcing students to take every class, it is better to give importance to that one particular class that the studnet is interested in. Studnets might like only one class and has a talent on that particular class, they should be allowed to take that particular class and does not have to take other classes. If a student does not want to participate in any particular class because of their personal reasons, schools should not force them to take those classes.

It is not that classes like arts, music and drama are not important to students. They are important and we should not neglect thoses classes. But the studnets should also not be forced to take every classes. Students should have their own rights to choose what classes they want and what they don't want. If they have to take every classes, it might be too much for them to handle.

830E5FA9FC72,"The Negative Effects Of The Technology On People's Lives.

Technology helps people to preform many things hence, classes online, shop and communicate with others. I believed that technology has negative effects on people's lives because people have a limitation of a human contact due to the use of technology. Also technology had changed our style of lives; People used to visit parks to talk with other. Families do not spend time together. Students are distracted with their cell phone at schools. Children do not read books or have fun like in the past. Now everything had changed due to this issue.

One reason that technology has negative effects on people's lives is that now some stores closed because people do not shop in this stores anymore. Some people prefer to buy their materials or clothes online stores as Amazon. Amazon has a strong impact of sales in the world, Their sales are more high than any other stores. For example I recently heard about two store named STORE_NAME and STORE_NAME. They have this issue due to the use of technology. STORE_NAME is about to close because people prefer to stay at home and buy online. This stores are on sale of everything to close right away because

Fewer people visit this stores. Their sales had exceed on online store than in the located stores. Additionally people who work in this stores are going to have a layoff due to this matter.

Another reason that technology has negative effects on people's lives is that some places are empty namely: Parks, lakes, and malls. People decide to stay at home playing video games, and buying online.

Some people think that technology is a better way to express themselves. However, there are to many ways such as painting, drawing, playing even dancing.

Example I am a member of a dance class, my teacher was talking about this problem with technology. She was saying that sometimes our lives depend on a cell device, but not all the time. My point of view is that what she told me was true because I came to United Stated of America since 2016; I was not be able to understand or speak to others. When I did not understand some difficult words I used Google translated, so technology helped us sometime. However, I had seen some students who used their cellphone during classes. When the teacher ask them questions related to the topic, they do not know what to answer due to the technology.

In the other hand Some people will argue about technology has positive effects on our style of lives. Technology helps us to communicate with our families and friends. However technology limited us to express our ideas with no need of a cell phone device . Also it had destroyed our culture. It limited the growth of children because, they do not want to go outside to play with their friends. Children want to stay at home playing with their laptops. In fact this generation do not read books or magazine because of the technology. Example, My cousin is in the middle school he played Fourtnite everyday. He goes to sleep late, had bad grades and he wake up late for school. He does not read any book and neither go outside to play. He always is with his cell phone playing. I believe that the life is so short to waste.

In the final analyses technology will keep going to destroy our cultures. People will not go outside at all, to buy, to have fun, or to spend time with their families. My point of view is technology have a really negative effect on us because it had changed us, our world. everything in this world is going to be different. Technology limited the develop of ideas.Technology limited our communication, our knowledge, our curiosity, and our happiness.        ",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5

You can use your imagination to solve math problems. When you don't know or don't understand something, sometimes you can use your imagination. You don't actually have to know anything to solve the math problem, but sometimes is best to use your imagination because you don't know what the problem is going to be about. For example, if you don't know how to do math or you never got to go to school, you can use your imagination to solve the math problem.

You can use your imagination to build stuff. If you like to build or to make stuff, you can always use your imagination. It's best to use your imagination when your building things because if you use your imagination, you can create things that nobody did before. Some of the useful things that you're building can help a lot of people. For example, you can build toys, make video games, or do anything you want to build with your imagination.

To the manager of

School is the place where we get opportunity to learn different things. Schools makes you capable to choose your own way. The main reason to go school is to make our career. Career is directly related to the employment. Everyone wants to do the best in their life. Employment is the thing that helps you to do best in your life and also helps us to understand who we are and how important we are. Now a days, school have partnerships with companies to help students to choose their interests employment. So, if you select me to visit and learn about the works, it will helps me to understand about the interest that I have for my future.

The most important things in students life is to choose their own interest, to make their future happy and peaceful ,but they really don't understand where will they go because of the pressure in their mind. So, I want to be selected to visit and learn about the work. It helps me to understand about the characteristic of the different works, and also helps me to recognize my interest for my career. Employment is not the biggest thing,but the interest is the biggest things. If we have interest in something, we defiantly work hard to get that goal. For example: I had a one friend whose name is Generic_Name, she choose to be a doctor in first, but then she realize that she never had any interest in doctor. After that, she left her job and become a photographer because photographic is her real interest not to be a doctor. That's why, I don't want to be confuse in my life. I want to be clear about my future.

All the people in this world are different, they have different aim in their life. Some wants to be doctor,some wants to be an engineer,pilot,photographer,dancer,etc. In this 21st century,all the parents wants their children to be a doctor or an engineer or in the other biggest post but not all the children have same interest as their parents have. Although they have different aim or interest, they join in the work that their parents wants because they don't understand the value of their interest. So, if the school or any companies allow students to explore or visit about the works, they better understand the value of their interests and never join in any other works that they don't want to be. I have an example of my own sister: In first, she joined in the medical line because my parents wants her to be a doctor and after she read some of the courses of the medicine,she realize that her interest is not to become a doctor and then she left her courses and start another courses. So, I really don't want that same things happened to me.

Time is very important for everyone. Nobody wants to waste their time because they believe that time is money. So,why students waste their time to choose the way that they don't want to go. Everyone has rights to select their own jobs. The problem is not that they don't get opportunity to choose their jobs,the problem is that they don't understand where is their destination. For example: If you left your dog in a street that he never walked,

then how can you expect that he accomplished his destination? Same happened to the students life, if someone who is well-experienced didn't tell them about the journey of life or how to choose their interest,how can we except that they will become a successful person.

Lastly, I want to say that if you select me to visit and learn about the work ,then I get opportunity to learn about my interest which helps me to get a better future. And also, if you select me I will aware other people about the interest or works and also help them to choose their interest. If I understand my journey, then I expect that I will success to get my destination. So, I humbly request you that please select me to visit and learn about the work that I have interest to do.

I will give you, and tell you what a pass through like a example. When I came to the United States; It was a may 21, 2014 (I thinks that's the correct day, I'm not sure). I was 13 years old, almost 5 years ago. I didn't know any English, but I said to myself, ""I'm never giving up, until i get it"". That was my goal. I learned some English, how to write it, and how to speak it, although I'm still learning it, but I keep going trying it without giving up, and the most important think is without losing the enthusiasm because if we want something, we need to keep going, and trying until we get it.

Some people think they can do it, and those people prefer to gave up, and NO! That's wrong. YOU NEED TO KEEP GOING UNTIL YOU GET IT, and NEVER GIVE UP! That's it. :)",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5

My position on this issue, I think students would not benifits from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because schools programmes its helping you to get more informations, learning more things to get high level.

For example when you attend classes in the schools it will be conversations between the teachers and students about the term than you will benifits more informations and working between students like a groups its reason to get more knowledge.

attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing you will not have attention like in schools classrooms because the teachers they helping you to understand and explaine more.

When you have a research at schools attend classrooms you can use technology and books and you can work like groups it will be more easy to do your research. But when you have attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing you will not have a conversation between others students to get more knowledge.

In my opinion, I prefer schools attend classes because when you focus with the teacher you will understand more about the term. For expample in my english class i pay attention at the class i can understand, and when i have a questions i ask my teacher to explaine for me.

I desagree with students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some courses you can't take it at home because you you need to worked like a groups. For example when i have work to do at schoul classroom's we work together to make the exrcises or a topic easy, and when you get absent and you left some works the teachers helping you to do it.

The schools classrooms programmes will help you about the time and they have specific time to work confortable and to know what have to do, some students they need support from they teachers and counselors to make sure they do alright. For example when i need support my teachers they support and they give me enough time to make i understand everythings.

Students who choice to learn at home by way of online or video conferencing they will not get conversation with speaking with others and with teachers. For examlpe when you have to work on topic it will be hard for some students to understand more.

In my opinion for the students who prefer to attend school classroom's it's good decision, because they will have more infermations and more experience about the way to make a plan and more knowledge about the courses you taking at school.

I think students would not benifit from being able to attend classes from home.                                             ",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.0

I believe that each person has 2 face`s 1 is used in the work or in the school,and the other face is showing on specific moments in your life as stress or your soccer team is losing 5-2.

one example of that is: when you are so angry an involuntary you use bad word, and after that you feel very well with yourself. Although what you make,but some part of you is broken for what you did;That simple think make you more human as anyone in this world, because is innecesary try to be perfect when you are not ready to be perfect in this accomplishment and wonderfull world.

85E3C840FCBF,"I agree with the idea of a year-round school because It sounds great to me. This idea has a lot of benefits towards the students and also the educators too. This idea provides a beneficial environment for both the students and the educators.

One of the reasons that this is a great idea is that,It makes the students to retain information easily when they get back from their break. They would retain information easily because the break they were given wasn't a long break and that will help them remember the materials that they were taught before the break. The other reason is that,the students will gain more knowledge by learning more materials. They will learn a lot of which will be beneficial to them,not only inside the school but also outside the school. They will also stay on task and be more focused on their studies.

Another reason is that,this idea of a year-round school will make work easy for the educators. It will make their work easy by not making them repeat the materials that the previously have taught because the students are able to remember the materials easily. They won't be forced to create retake tests and assignments and that would allow them to have an easy job. An example of why a year-round school is beneficial is that,It creates an environment where the students enjoy learning and the educators enjoy teaching.

Lastly,I would say that a year-round school is a great idea because It creates an environment where both the students and the educators can benefit from. It Impacts both the students and the educators in a productive way. The students would have more passion and love towards learning while the educators would also gain more passion towards their profession and remarkably enjoy teaching.",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.0
85F4C57672EA,"""Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home""? I do not believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. I believe the students can get distracted so easily at home. For example, you start watching a movie; when you were supposed to your homework. That would affect your grade because you didn't do it on time. Another, example is when your mom tell you to buy something and then you forgot what were you doing. In addition, time is another reason why is not beneficial taking classes from home.

Time is one of the consequences attend to classes online is not beneficial because unexpected things can happen. You can't control time. For example, someone in your family die or they have a car crash or even work schedule. Those examples can affect you by reducing the time and material you were to work on. That's why you can't predict what is unexpected. Unexpected times take away your energy, concentration and comprehension on what your studying. Another, reason why classes from home isn't good.

Energy keep you awake. Being concentrate shows interest on what you doing and comprehension is how much you understand. If you're sleepy you cannot do any of that. However, I want to focus more in the comprehension part. Never ever compare a teacher vs a computer. For example, you didn't understand the new unit because is confusing, you can always put your hand up and ask the teacher. The teacher will explain at their best for you to comprehend. On the contrary, you can't do it because you're at home and nobody can explain the material you don't understand.

Some students agree they can benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they can do it later, if they miss something on class. Also, they can study anywhere they can have access to it. That reject to be in certain place. You're free to study and work without any restrain. All you need is to manage your time.

You be able to kill two birds on the same shot.

To conclude, students will realize that a teacher is way better than a computer. The teachers study the materials on what they gonna teach and they graduate from college, gain a diploma of what they teaching you. They have the proof and I believe they are doing the right choices about giving you materials for you on the future. That's why i would never change them for one computer at home.

I Understand that you are concidering the idea to work in group. I appreciate what are you trying to do and I agree with, for two reasons I think working in group can give you a lot of benefits because you can help each other, so you can do a better job and, also you can share differents ideas with your parners.

The first reason is that you can do a better job working in group. For example when I am working in group in my job I ask my parners to check my work to make sure I am doing a good job.

additianally, you can share different ideas with your parners or also, you can share your toys that you usually use for work. For example when I am working in group with my class I always ask my friends if I can use their stuf.

Therefore I strongly believe that working in group give you a lot of benefits. which I allow with positive for two reasons. you can do a better job helping each other and, also you can share your ideas with your parners. thank for your time.

869CC4EDD3B5,"It working in a group more better or we get beneficial them working alone?

working in group have many beneficial them working alone. In my opinion working in group is better them working alone. Because friends or partners can help us to do the work better and more simple. Also we all can do the work more faster than doing the work alone. And we don't feel the job or work hard as we usually felt doing alone.

Friends or partners can help us to do the work better and more simple. And we all put our interest to do the best as we can with the work. And we try that the work look good and nice. Also we put our effort to do the work and that the teacher see that we all work together. And we try our best to do the work the way that she or he wanted to be. And friends or partners can be good if we need to do a drawing or with the hand writing. Also if you're partners help you with the work the teacher is going to sacrifice with the work that all of you are doing.

We all do the work more faster than doing the work alone. Because we try that everyone have one part of the work. And that way we can finish the work fast. Also everyone participate in the work. And we all have some part of the credit. Also we try to do the work fast but also we try that the work look good. And we no just do the work fast because we want to finish quick and them do nothing. Sometime it because the teacher a specific time to finish and with a group we can finish on time and also the work can look good too.

We don't feel the job or work hard as we usually felt doing the work alone. We don't feel the work hard because we separate the work in parts. And if there is 4 in a group we all 4 do a list one part of the work. Also in a group there is always one or two person that know how to draw, have a good hand writing, or know how to decorate, and one that is looking the thing we need in internet for the work. Also we divide the part to every person and we all are attendant that the work do okay. The job is more easy to do if there if more than one doing the same work.

In my final opinion I think that work in group it better them working alone . Because working in groups have many beneficial that we can use wisely. But if you are working in ground and the group is doing nothing if better for you working alone in that situation. Because you have to intelligent and organize first and everyone know what they have to do we all can get a good grade in the work. Some of the benefits that we can get working in groups are. Work with friends or partners can help us to do the work better and more simple. Also we can do the work more faster than doing the work alone. And final we don't feel the job or work hard s we usually felt doing alone. Also working in groups it help to the development. For me it better working in a group have many beneficial and is very helpful to do the work good and nice foe the teacher can be proud of the group work.

86ECF13FEDEF,"Why I disagree that first impression are almost likely to never change overtime? Well,In this world many people have experience bad,nice,and fake first impressions. Why because people have a bad feeling about you, you are not aware of what is happening in their heads, and maybe they just wanna take advantages of your personality or who you are.

One, First Impressions that I deal with everyday is give nice impressions with my friends. However, the person need to be interest on the topic you're talking about or just be goofy. People sometimes come up to you and smile and said hi or was sup because they know you're alone. If you wanna make new friends or have the respect that you want you only got to show them your nice impression. For Example: In the movie Everything,Everything the girl couldn't go outside because she could get sick,but the new neighbor his name is Generic_Name and he decided to smile and said hi through the window. She smile back to him and then she went to bed.

Two, I have experience bad impressions about people being rude for no reason. They bring a side of me that when they said bad stuff they think that I am going to stay quiet. I just give them the same energy back because nobody deserved to be treated on a bad way when you're trying to just said Hi or want a new friends. If your in pain or suffering don't take out your anger on others cause for a first impression you going to be looking like a bad guy. For Example: If a Hispanic kid decide to ask a person for the class room number and that person start to laugh in his face the Hispanic kid gonna feel oppress and feel bad. People don't realize that by first impressions you could win the whole world, but no people like to be hard and act childish.

Three,Fake Impressions make the person to take advantage of your opportunities and your personality. The person wants attention all the time but then start talking mess up things about you. I have experience people making fake impressions when they said Hi they look at you a certain way that you know is wrong. Fake Impression led you to think that the other person is talking behind your back. The person pretends to like you, but in particular the person don't care about your feelings or the friendship. For Example: My Ex BFF a year before we stop talking we meet and is was fun, but until I left to VA she decide to not care for me,text me, or call me. That hurt me so much that months past by an you even feel better without that friend because since the begging she was giving me fake impressions and I didnt catch on.

In conclusion, Sometimes you need to calm down before to start speaking to a person. Be nice and never let negative thoughts on your mind that are going to make you look bad. Let people talk to you first and then think about their first impression. I been nice, but sometimes I gotta get mad with people cause they don't even know you and start calling you names but is not worth it to think about that cause that said a lot about their first impressions. First Impressions will never change cause once you speak whatever come out your mouth is gonna stick to that person forever. You know that you when accomplish somebody smile or laugh that's everything to them is important that is their first reaction and by First Impression you can win the world by been nice all the time and make new friends or win the respect that you deserve or them.",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5

Students may have or need a job for many such ass, being able to sport there family so they are not always going to be available after school to attend those classes required to graduate in 3 years. Students my also need to save up for a higher education if they plane on attending a 4 year university or even attending a community college. students also need some time of work expires so they need that job so they are able to put on there resume that they have some form of work expires so if they decide that right after high school they want to just jump in into the work force they have some type of work expires. Another reason why students should not be allowed to do the 3 year program is because its going to be stressful trying to put a 4 year education in 3 years. Some students take advance courses that are more chalaging, and give out more homework then regular classes. some students are not going to be available after school because they may have to stay after school to retake important quizzes or test that are going to affect a big part of there grade. A student may have to go home and work on big projects or homework so there ability to stay after school is going to be limited due to the fact that they have homework to do and other assignment. One other major reason is that the student with be involved in extra curricular activity such ass sports some sports can be year around sports so even is not there season they still have to condition and train for the upcoming season so they are most likely going to have to stay after school hours to do those things. another reason is that they might be involved in clubs so they also have to stay after school and also have to do some type of volunteering in the community so thats going to take away time so they may not be away available to attend to all the required classes to be able to graduate using the 3 year program. another reason is that they might have tutoring either at home or in school so they are able to get help on homework and other material that they need help with projects and stuff like that.

My conclusion is that no students should not be alowd to graduate early using the 3 year program, became is going to add on to things that the students already have going on in there lives so i believe student should just graduate with there class and take there time and graduate high school in 4 years.

876CDA4D152D,"Do you think that all students have the capacity to commit to a career at a young age? In this paper I will argue about how students do not have the ability to commit to a career at a young age. Students shouldn't commit to a career, because they can change their mind, they are not good at only one thing or they don't want to do anything.

A lot of people I know keep changing their mind, they are not ready to keep doing only one thing for the rest of their lives. My sister is an example: She is now almost about to finish her career but she wants to leave it because now she is interested in another thing. When she was in high school the career that she is in right now wasn't something that she wanted because she didn't like it, she does now, but she wants to do other things. For some people is not easy to stick with something, because they will keep changing their mind.

Since I was young I wanted to do a lot of things in life. I can't commit to only one career because there is so many things that I want to do and like to do, for example: When I was 6 years old I liked playing the guitar, I still like to play the guitar but it is no something I want to to as a career. At 3 years old I loved to dance, it is something that I will always like to do but that is not something that I see myself doing for the rest of my life. And when I was 10 years old I started to draw, I started by drawing animals or any cartoon character, but now I draw whatever comes to my mind, however, it is not something I want to keep doing. Since there is not only one thing I like to do I can't commit to only one thing in life and If i do commit, later in life I will probably regret doing it.

There are many students at my age that really don't want to do anything with their life or they don't have the ability do it. Some drop out of school because it is no something they are interested and probably it's something they are not good at and give up. Most of them just want to stay home and do nothing. They stay at their parents house, which is not bad, but they stay there and do not look for any job. Some look for jobs but it is not something they like, it is something that is easy and can get them money to survive.

Some say that all students can commit to a career, but they are wrong because not all students have the same mind sets as other students. At a young age not all students can do a career. In the future most of the students wont want to stick to only one career because they wouldn't only like one thing, so they should decide when they are ready and really know that the career that they are choosing will be the one that wont get tired of doing it.

8773AAFA4355,"Have you ever wondered what it would feel like to be in a school play? I have, one enjoyable activity I would want to be is a school play. I think this will be an enjoyable activity for school because you can meet new people, work with a team, and most of all have a great time.

During the play the cast members can make new friends and meet new people. It's important that the cast gets to know each other and become friends. Also they can rehears lines together. It's also helpful to make new friends especially if you shy. It's important not to be shy on the night of the actually play. You have to be brave and have confidence in yourself for the night of the play.

Another example why this this would be an enjoyable activity for school is working together as a team. Working together as a team can be enjoyable and important. For example the cast can help build sets, make costumes, rehears lines, and so much more. Sometimes after rehearsals the cast can go out to eat or have fun. also working together as a team is easier so you can get more work done.

The last reason why having a play is enjoyable because after all the hard work with the team everyone can watch the play. You will be able to perform the play in front of students,teachers,friends,and families. The most important thing is that you had a fun time making, being in the play, and working with other students.

They can be difficult to change, but they aren't almost impossible to change because there are ways that can help you change your first impression. A thing about first impression is to question yourself on is ""how can I change my own first impression?""

A lot of people say it's almost impossible to change your own first impression, but what they don't realize is that they aren't thinking hard enough to comprehend to understand why they aren't almost impossible to change, so they instead just don't even try and use more of their cognitive ability. What's important about first impressions is having to say something that will impress others.

When you use more of your cognitive ability, then you'll be able to come up with better first impressions. Once you're able to come up with a better first impression; you'll find it easier easier than what other people said based on their opinion. In conclusion, first impressions are a lot easier to change when you think about how you'll change your first impression and when you come up with a better one, but it takes time to develop

In my opinion, prompt is a something positive attitude in our life, and I agree with that because we have to learn how to be prompt. Next, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because we can go far with that, for example: In my future I can get my goals and get everything in my life, that is, a car, a big house, and things like that. Then, I agree with the positive attitude, that is something important to do and to have a better life. Also, my idea is, if we are positive in our life, we can get a lot of success with our goals.

I can follow these list to see what I can do to a positive attitude.

Do something interesting

Search something new

Talk with a trust friend

After that, some people disagree to a positive life because I think they don't have something in their life, like a good future. Something interesting,

a prompt help us to do everything fast but is not good,

because can happened something bad.

A positive attitude is the key to success in life because that's something important we have to do, if don't do something good we don't have a better life, we stay in the same way, for instance, each day we have to know new things, for this reason a agree whit that. I believe to success in life because I can get a lot opportunities. In my opinion to have a positive life, we can relax, read books, listen to music, go out to walk or talk with some good person, these can help us to forget the problems or something bad in our life. Be positive is something can help you to do what you want in your life, and other people to be positive.

Later on, my mom said, I have to be always positive and try any thing new, I think that is true because some times when I can't do something, I try do it like 3 times, after three times I can to everything to myself, so that's a good idea to try every thing what we can't do.

A prompt is something what can we do fast and done quickly. Prompt can help us to get everything done early but sometimes can happen something bad, so have to always care and think what we going to do first.

Lot of students can't stay without cellphones; however, they should know the without phones in classroom they will learn more.

First, Students will get distracted if they have their phones in classroom.

They will be texting in class, and they will be on social media while the teacher is explaining. Furthermore, some students spend their class time, playing video games, watching movies, or videos on YouTube. It also distract other students that really wants to learn. Sometimes, the teacher allows students to use their phones in classes for educational purpose; however, the students take advantage because they use that time for playing some music on YouTube or taking pictures around the class, so I would not recommend teachers to let them use their phones in classes. I remember the time when I was in 9 grade, I often used my phone in classroom. I thought it would not affect my grades; however, at the end of the semester I saw only D in all of my classes. I stopped using my phone in class, and my grades were getting better.

Second, students should keep away their phones in classes for safety. I believe that no one is perfect and there are some students who doesn't have a good behavior in school, so they use their phone for taking inappropriate pictures. In addition, we have seem some examples in other schools about terrorism, and we don't know what students do outside or what kind of friends they have out of school, so the student inside of school may be stay in contact with terrorist outside of the school in case of any terrorist attack. The teacher will be thinking that his or her students are reading about the topic in the class, but the true would be that students are using their phone in a different purpose.

The Department of Education should establish a law about not allow students to use their phones in classroom or not use it at all in schools because they won't be able to pay attention, and because is a good way to keep safety in the school. Some may say, students need their phones in class for search information or call for any emergency; however, students don't need their phone when the school provides computers for searching any information, and they don't need their phone for emergency because the school provides police officers and good strategies to protect them in case of any emergency.

Do we choose our character traits, or our character forms by influences beyond our control? I think we can control our character traits because we can choose our character traits like being quiet, being social, and being over yourself. This is why I think we choose our character traits.

For example, I think we choose our character traits like being quiet. Being quiet isnt a good or bad thing like you can be quiet sometimes not all the time because you got to talk once in a while. You have to balance it all out. I remember back when i was i middle school 6th to 7th grade I was a quiet kid with little friends like I would not talk to no one. I felt so alone because of that, then I started talking to people and got lots of friends. So, I think we can control our character traits. Thats why I think we choose our character traits like being quiet.

Also, another example is being social. Being social is a great thing to have because talking to people is good like you can make friends, learn new things. and even discover new things. I was a very talkative kid in 7th to 8th grade I remember that I felt like I was annoying to some people because i talked a lot. I also learned new things like how to approach and talk to people. I discover new things to like I discover that people can change over time. Some are nice then they turn moody or mean, and others were mean then nice. Some people dont change and that happens to thats how the world works. Thats why I think we can control and choose our character traits like being social.

Therefore, my next example is being a over yourself. like being confident or keeping yourself in check thats a good trait to have. It can be also a bad trait because you can be over confident and cocky. Some people dont like those kind of people because they say ""there no fun"" or they are ""party poopers."" I'll confess that I was a little cocky and over confident when it came to sports because i was a very competitive kid. Sometimes I even screamed and yelled of happiness because I scored or won a game. Some people also think thats our character traits are influence beyond our control, and yes I can see there point of view because, when I screamed and yelled when I scored or won I game i didnt control it i just yelled. I could've not yelled I could've just celebrated with my hands and look up in the sky but I didnt do that. This is why I think we can choose our character traits like being over yourself.

Finally, I think when the British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" He though one of two things he thought we choose our character traits, or our character forms by influences beyond our control. I think he thought we choose our character traits like being quiet, being social, and being over yourself. This is why I think he thought about we choose our character traits.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0
8AB55CB5992E,"There was a guy who decided to eat a ghost pepper because of a dare and next thing you know it they are in the hospital, not so good isnt it. One day one of my friends Generic_Name from a while back lets say elementary school, Generic_Name was eating lunch and some kid came by and swiped his tray off the table, he wanted to beat they other person up and I said no I suggest you go talk to a teacher about it. Although some might believe, asking for help (guidance), talking to your priors or family members, having confidence in yourself proves seeking for guidance from experts and authorities about life important matters is a good idea.

Asking for help and guidance. My friend Generic_Name was having a tough time choosing which college he wants to go to. I told him to go talk to your counselor and now he's now in Generic_school because he asked about what colleges seem good and are better for Generic_Name. This relates to asking for help because he had no idea where he wanted to go if he made the decision to go some college, having no background knowledge of the school and he got there noticed its not for me, he is screwed. That means it is a good idea to ask experts at finding the right college for you.

Talking to your priors, family members and communicating. I always ask my friends and family what to do for certain things such as what classes do you think seem good that I also like or what sport should I join and try out. I think communicating is great because it sets a good outlook on your personality. That's how you make more friends like you want to know what good advice they can give you and you can give them. People who don't communicate will always have a tough time talking to people, they will be really quiet and lonely at times. This relates to talking to priors and family members and communicating because they are here to help you out no matter what.

Having confidence in yourself. If you start communicating and talking a lot more, it will build up confidence to the point where you won't be nervous to talk in front of a class. One of my good friends named Generic_Name came to Generic_school awhile back all quiet and had a soft voice until he started talking to people like his friends and family everyday, now it sounds like he is a whole different person and he is way more confident in public speaking. this relates to the having confidence because he was scared of talking to people until he starting talking to everybody he saw in the hallways and built his confidence to a new level. Anybody can overcome the fear of speaking just by talking with your family first then friends and people you don't know.

Whats important is that you learn to talk to people like your family, friends, and your school administrators. Some people have a bad past in speaking to one another but it all comes down to are you going to make a change because that person who has difficulties in speaking, doesn't like it either. I want people to overcome their fear of communicating in the future because that's a big deal if you don't, many jobs out they need people to speak well with other folks. This relates to stuff in a political aspect basically media because people on there need to speak to one hundred million of people out in the world on TV.    ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5
8AF043C98622,"During years had been existed a question among be yourself and be like the people wants you to be; in this time I'm agree with the author when he say,"" to be yourself is the greatest accomplishment in this world that is trying constantly to make you someone else,"" because there is a lot of people that shows indifference with you, only because of the way you think , or for simples things like how you wear, the music you like, or how you like to live.

Be yourself is one of the best things that exists in this world, because you don't have to act different in front of the other people just to be accepted, one of the advantages to be yourself is, if you are loved by someone for how you are, you don't be afraid to hurt that person because of your bad actions.

Otherwise, we also can get benefits for being how the world wants you to be, for example in your job, you are getting pay for all your effort working hard although you want to do it or not.

Nevertheless, in this world we alway are controlled by someone no matter what. Beliefs, the law, or parents; and it's necessary to be controlled because they are teaching us how we have to be in a good way.

Although there are obstacles that are trying to not let you to be yourself, always is better no matter what is in front of you, it feels confortable without conceal of nobody, that's why I think to be yourself is the greatest accomplishment.

8B155840CA6D,"Summer is the time for students to take a break from school, but some educators feel that summer break is too long and it needs to be shorten. As for me, I am strongly disagree with this idea because summer is the time for student to visit their famiy, their relatives, to do whatever they like, to enjoy whatever they love and sometimes learning too much might be somthing that some students could not handle.

First of all, summer is the time for students to come back to their hometown to visit their family. Some students, like me, came from another country so a lot of times we do miss our hometown. That is why having a three month summer break is truly a huge chance for us because that is pretty much the only reunion we have in a year. I will take mine as an example. To be able to come back to Generic_City it is not just about time, sometimes it could involve money. The ticket is just too expensive, not to mention that it is in summer. So if I can visit my family this year, I might have to wait a few years later to be able to visit them again.

Secondly, this is a period of time where students can do whatever thay want to do like doing some volunteering or club activities or playing sports or just simply doing their favorite hobbies. If we shorten the summer break, students will easily get bored when they come back to school because they do not have enough time to do what they like in summer. Nobody wants to study when they are bored. So if we want a student to return to school with lots of energy, we need to let them have a break. And that give me an example. One of my Vietnamese friend told me that even in summer he still have to take a lot of tutor classes. That is why if we shorten the summer break then lots and lots of Asian students will not even have time to do what they love!

Last but not least, learning too much might be something that some students could not handle. A short summer break meaning we have to go to school more than we need. I know that if we shorten the summer break we will have a longer winter break, but that is not the case for the country that does not have a winter break or a week off in fall and spring. A student could get stress if they do not have a proper break. Just check some examples on the news or internet, especially in South Korea or Japan. A lot of students suicide just because of learning too much. Too many homeworks and tests, pressures from parents and teacher,.... Very stressful! Not to mention that Asian students usually have a shorter summer break and winter break.

On the whole, I am not agree with this idea and along with fact that I am an Asian and I used to go through a very strict and tough education in Asia, I can never accept this. Students need to have some times to release their stress after a long year at school by visiting their family or doing whatever they like.",4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,3.0,3.5

-

Generic_Name

Education can be considered to have an immense and influential extent over the preparation of individuals within the constantly expanding world. It can determine how a future employee may react to a circumstance or perhaps how they may solve it. Entire generations have been based upon education. Fundamentals such as algebra and language skills learned by these individuals have sculpted the process for man to touch the Moon and to cease global crises. All of this has possibly resulted in the world we exist in today. My perspective on the circumstance is that the school board should not increase the school's schedule due to the following: the current schedule already establishes 7 hours of probable physical and intellectual progression, students can experience more unproductive and negative entities, and that the addition of one and a half hours may produce incompatibilities towards both student and related individual schedules.

Beginning with the 7-hour process, students enter the building and perhaps have already encountered a dilemma. Certain peers may have caught the bus late or arrived earlier than allowed to. Afterwards, they could be in their classes trying to understand how a certain concept functions with another and may simultaneously be attempting to concluded a page of homework. Moving from class periods to lunch, they may find themselves perplexed at what they are going to do with their locker's present condition. Even at the end of the day they may be questioning what to do with their best friend while they both have separate projects due tomorrow. In essence, a student's day can be of highly troubling challenges as well as instances that an be excessively stressful in relation to the students alone.

With the prolonging of the day present, multiple casual difficulties may be amplified whilst new forms of faults can be felt by many students. A select few could include having to finish more assignments, receiving an increase of homework, and quite more. Certain subject periods may become uninteresting after critically focusing time upon them, and other periods may become shorter in order to cope the extension of time. Events that have a possibility of occurring throughout the day can be unintentionally imposing and certain situations may very well be perceived by an array of people as impossible to conclude with the aforementioned extension.

A final note pertaining to the topic is that a longer daily routine may lead to extensive conflict with faculty, student, guardian time frames. Students can have extracurricular activities that can require adequate time to function properly such as baseball and/or team swimming. The parents and guardians of the students may now not have time to fulfill their career schedules in order to react with their children and could result in negative consequences.

Faculty members may have to stay a longer duration to cleanse or conclude their occupational duties because of the excess of materials and activities. The people apparent within the school and to some degree outside of it could be left with the severe imbalance of two correlating but differed schedules they must interact with.

Though a multitude of negative concepts and events may be associated with the topic of extending the day, there are quite in fact a variety of benefits to such a transformation. A prolonged schedule can be excellent for the further study of a subject as well as direct application. Homework can have a higher chance of being finished within school hours. Socialization in lunch and gym sessions could be extended. However, negative concepts can still be present with the solutions, which may indicate that no matter what may be of the scenario, unproductive elements can still remain.

As previously mentioned, I take a view that is against the prolongment of the academic schedule as it relates to incompatibilities for multiple individuals, an increase in negativity, and the current time frame and activities of school.

Once again, parents and guardians may have to reduce time at their positions in order to cope with shift of schedule. Homework and subject directives may become more significant in amount and requirement, perhaps stressing the students and teachers to quite the degree. The current schedule alone has multitudes of events, activities, and concepts that are brimming in attentiveness and consumption. Benefits and negatives of the school lengthening its duration are and can be present, but truly take into consideration what a change in a time frame could result in; its impacts can be irreversibly.

8C01B86DE888,"Homework Clubs

Imagine getting all of your work completed easily and correct! A homework club are for students that is having a difficult time of getting their work done, they can also do their work together as a class. Homework clubs are good for students because they can finish it early, they can help each other, and it improves their learning skills.

First, students finish early. Students can do something else later instead of homework, and it helps them avoid of getting a late work. For example, back in 7th grade, I didn't really do my homework and I knew that I didn't make the right choice so the consequences were having a bad grade, and being grounded for a long amount of time. I really didn't like doing homework but I learned something from it so I started doing my work since I was grounded.

Second, students can help each other. Students can help the ones that are having a difficult time of doing their homework, they can also finish their work easily. For example, when I stayed after school for my English teacher to do work, I realized that I finished most of my work because I was focused and I asked the teacher multiple times to help me with some of the work. It helped me bring my grades up from a failing to a passing. So I suggest that students should do homework clubs to get their work done.

Third, It improves their learning skills. It improves their collaboration, and it improves their communication skills, and it can improve their skills on every subject. For example, when I was in 4th grade, I didn't know a single word in English so I was in this program called, English and Second Language, where they taught me new words everyday until I started talking English in class and to other students. It helped me came along this far where I didn't need it anymore. I was scared to talk to people because I thought that they would make fun of me because I didn't know how to talk, but I was wrong. I made my first friend in 5th grade and his name was Etka, we were both at the program but he knew a lot more English than me so he also helped me improve my communication skills along the way.

I think that after school homework clubs are good for students because students can finish it early with the help of one another and the teacher. The most important thing about this club is that it improves your learning skills and your communication skills.",4.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.5

When you done something in your life you will be successful, not boring, and proud of yourself. I agree with Thomas Jefferson that, we have to accomplish in our life because when we will accomplish in our life we will get our goal, however, people might disagree with me, and they think that inactivity serve a purpose and that's not true.

It's a great thing to be successful in your live. "" Don't work hard but work smart"". In another words, you have to keep yourself working all the time. When you success in anything you feel comfortable. For example, In our school you have to do your work so you can success. when you let yourself finish the work you will be successful. Let yourself to be accomplishment in anything and you will be successful for ever.

When you keep yourself busy, you will never get board in your life. Being active all the time is healthy. Keep yourself working out, study, driving, eating, so you don't get board of your life. Always do anything to until you accomplished and do not leave it until you finished. For example, I go play soccer so I wouldn't get board in my life. If you don't want to get board, make your self create anything, keep your brain thinking in everything, play sports, believe in your self that you can accomplish anything in the world. Do not get lazy anytime because if you got idle you will not be an accomplish person in live.

Everyone will be proud of you when you accomplish something. You will be proud of yourself too that you accomplished something in your life. Always work hard so you can get a good grade and you will be proud of yourself. For example, I worked hard last year in World history and Geography and I passed the SOL, my dad and my mom both of them were proud of me and the whole family were proud of me, so you have to being working all the time.

8D02AC12DD48,"As I know the Music,Drama, and Art classes are not mandatory to take. the leaners at education area can take these classes for their choices. infact it is a elective not mandatory. so the leaners can take these subject as a elective. for example: if a student take an art class infact he/she is not take it as a required class he/she take it for their choice and wants to get extra credit. or if a person has 4 required classes and and he/she take a art class instead one of the 4 classes and he/she thaught this is the 4 classes that i need for graduation indeed they are going to take a wrong class because as we know the art classes is not needed for graduation. so we have to take a class that we needed for graduation.

Although some educator take the art or music classes off course seniors because they might be have less classes. in this case they choose these classes as choice and the junior can take these as well to get extra credit.

lets talk about the required classes:

require classes are: English11,geometery,math,CIS,world history,and etc...

these classes that students need to take it and complete the school credit and recived a better score for graduation.

each subject has different SOL test.

when the students reach to those classes they need to pass the SOL test as well as SOL is one of the important part of required classess that leaners need to pass it during a year. the SOL test comes twice for students off course!

they have to recived over 300 score which can allowed to take it again. so that is the required classes which is a student learn in a year.

although we have a electives classes such is Art,Drama Music and etc but we can not counted on required classes. So Art,Drama, and Music are not necessary to take it as required classes those should be electives that leaners can choose as favorate subject for their future.",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5

The first reason that inactivity should serve as a purpose is because people that aren't doing anything should be able to accomplish their work and other work so that they did not finish and they dont have an excuse to not do work. On the other hand people doing work have an excuse because if they are given a lot for work they might not have time to finish the other work but the people that finish working and have some time left should be given more work in till they done have anymore time at school or at work.

The disadvantages of doing such a thing to school are, Schools are reducing school hours, teachers won't be getting a salary instead they will get pay hourly, and the economic is going to be low.

I believe that, school days shouldn't be reduce ,just because they want to save energy. Students must be at school for eight hours. Otherwise the teachers won't have the time to give the given material. Students studies will get interrupted if they get two hours of school weekly.

Second reason, is that teachers won't be getting a salary for two hours of work. The pay checks will be reduce to hours worked during the week just like any other job that pays by hour. That means that those people need a secondary job so they can support themselves

Finally, the economic will increase because businesses are reducing peoples hours just because they want to save up energy. People have debts to pay like credit cards, health/car insurance etc. Food cost will highly increase its price.

8EF3D97E2310,"The term success has a different meaning for everyone, but still it is what everyone wants. No matter what the goal is, in order to approach that goal, and to be successful you need hard work. I believe the majority will agree with this statement, but everyone does not agree, and talk about positive attitude. People miss the importance of positive attitude which is the key for success.

Chances in life comes and goes that some might not even see. All of the hard work has no meaning if there is no pay back for this hard work. Loosing the sight while working hard causes to miss the train, but having positive attitude makes individuals seek for opportunities. If the goal is success, then missing the chance to making it come true must be avoided. When individuals miss the first chance they think there is no more chance and they loose the rest of there positivity. Even in our daily life, when we start of our they in a negative way; the rest of the day follows that bad influence, and makes us miss the good parts of the day.

Having a negative environment affects the individuals the worst way possible, especially if the individual does not have a positive attitude to fight back. Fighting back with a positive attitude is also going to influence others to have a better view, so it does not just affect the individuals success, but others too. When we take a look at the most famous entrepreneurs we see how a great environment they have, and how successful the people around them is, like they are. It is the positive attitude that spreads the influence and makes a better habitat. The positive influence follows it self and creates a better habitat, and a better habitat will cause success.

Reaching to the best of the goal is impossible with out hard work. There has to be a effort to find the right way, but having the negativity is going to close the door for opportunities. However, setting up a positive mind set is the part what individuals misses. Positive attitude is what is going to bring the opportunities, and make the individuals create their own chances. Famous entrepreneurs like Elon Musk would not be the Elon Musk that we know today if he did not had the positive attitude. Elon Musk created a company named ""SpaceX"" for Space craft, and if he gave up on the first failure, and did not had the positive attitude, he would have never reached to his goal, and be successful. He created his own chance to success with positive attitude.

In conclusion, positive attitude has a big influence on success. Every individual can have a different explanation for their goal, and the goal is the positive influence in their life.

Influencing others.

Argument:

Influence is a big word. It has a lot of meanings. It has a lot of ways to describe.

Position:

Mi position is negative for the word influence. It gets othes in wrong ways. It is the word that convince othes to do somthing.

For example:

Somebody offer you some beer, wine, or drugs that are bad influence. If a friend say to you, hey come on lets stole that bicicle it's a bad influence. I now some people that they copy the stile life from others that is not right, so that is the bad influence. Infuence is when somebody buys things that are not health, like Mc donal's, red bulls or chips those are bad influence for you.

Conclusion:

In my conclusion I think that influencing others is not good because it to force many people to do several things wrong. It convince many children to go throught bad ways. However, the word influence can be exellent too. It can describes many things that can be good in your work or in your life.

8FFDA5B9D359,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I agree with this statement i have three reasons why I think students should be able to attend classes from home. One reason is some students have a alot of responsibilities at home and sometimes students arent able to go to school. Some might have kids and they need to stay home to take care of there kid because nobody can babysit. That's really hard for a student to do. Trying to go to school and have a kid can be very stressful to the student.

My second reason I have for this statement is some students feel comfortable having class in there own safe environment where they feel comfortable and not anxious. There are some students that have anxiety and are not able to function in a classroom full of students that can be really hard for a person because its not easy trying to get your work done in a classroom full of students and dealing with anxiety. That can be very stressfull I feel like a student should comfortable in there learning environment because when they are comfortable they achieve better in there work. They can focus better and get work done and won't be distracted by anyone there's a lot of benefits with that. Parents would also agree that having ther child in a environment that they are comfortable in is the best way to keep there child focused and willing to pass there classes without any distractions that the child doesn't need.

My third reason i agree with this statement is students can feel more determined to do there work at home in a quiet place its very helpfull to the students needs to be sucssesful. Some students get distracted easily and can't in a classroom so attending class at home helps the student concetrate and perform better with there work.

Another reason is parents would feel comfortable with there child being at home doing school work where they are safe and focused on the right things which is school work. Some students find it easier to do things online than in a classroom so its all about personal prefrence and i agree with this because it could be hard trying to understand what the teacher is saying or talking about. It's good to have a sense of understanding when it comes to learning something that's very important for students.

My conclusion to this statement is that i agree and I think it is a great idea for schools to offer this to students because it gives students a chance to be at home and pass there classes with no distractions. It also gives them an oppotunity to sucsseed and graduate. I also agree about doing school online because some students find it easier and better than being in a classroom all day and not being able to understand the teacher. I also like this because you can do your class work where ever you are you dont have to be at home if you have somewhere to be you can take a laptop and do work. I think doing online class works for a busy students schedule its all around is a good idea and I am happy that schools are letting students do online classes its a big benefit for them that's why I agree with this statement.

915D8BF74963,"Is it good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? For example, I got a academics scholarship into George Mason. With that scholarship I earned and worked so hard I could have a high chance of becoming a banker or someone who runs money and I been committing to this career from 8th grade. Knowing and committing to a career puts you on a very a head spot in life and also on what you want to become.

First off, having a head start of knowing what career you want in High School puts you on a spot that you're a head. People who don't know what careers they want, gives them a struggle because when you get to College or finish High School they would be in a position of not knowing what to do after. The stress will build up, over thinking, anxiety, give up, depression, and lastly the most important going to the wrong path. But people who know what career they want in High School will be ready for what college they should go to, what classes to take, after college they'll be applying to jobs, and lastly, doing something they always wanted to become or do since High School. For example, I have a friend who just turned 20, He always told me about what career he wanted to do and his plan after High School. A year ago, I asked him about his career and plan. He already has a job of what he wanted since High School but at the age of 19 and also told me he was thankful for staying with the career he always wanted and never gave up. He also told me, It wasn't easy to become what he wanted and no matter what if you want something, keep pushing and never give up because soon you'll be proud or yourself.

Secondly, The stress of committing a career from High School is less than not having one. People who already know what they want to become or do will have their challenges because it wont be easy to getting up there. For example, people who already know what they want will face tests, projects, public projects, quizzes, finals, and etc. But that's only what they have to face. For the people who don't know what they want to do, will start worrying about what they want to do, stressing over why they didn't think of a career in High School, over thinking, and etc. It's better if know what you want to become early than late because it could waste your time if you start late instead of starting early or on time.

Lastly, having to learn different careers is good, but it'll some times be confusing, over whelming, stress, anxiety, and etc. But just knowing one career you'll be able to focus on that specific career. Trying to push yourself passing those limits, making yourself you can do it, never giving up, and reaching your goal. Having to learn many careers is very good, because you know a lot and a high chance of getting many jobs. But learning and staying one career is better because you will know what to do in a mil of a second. People would want to hire you because how fast and hard worker you are. It's better to have a head start from everyone than being last.

Therefore, knowing and commting to one career puts you on a very good spot. For example having a head start, less stress involved, and lastly choosing you love since High School. Finally, these are the reasons why it is a good idea for students in High School to commit to a career at a young age. So what, are you going to commit to a career at a young age because time is clicking and soon it'll be too late. ",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5
918C1880FCD8,"When did you decide to research your future job?

Students should start thinking of a certain career they would want to encounter by the time they reach high school. by the time students reach high school they must have a job they're interested in. If students start viewing the concepts they need, they can become what they want to be. Also by starting early with a goal, researching, and acknowledging goals they can find a job that they would like. Also will have a distinct idea on how to succeed.

First step, In most societies students start researching different jobs at a young age, so they know what they want to become in the future. Research helps students find what they need as a teenager, for example: getting a Standard or Advanced diploma, going to College, and getting a degree. when students start encountering what they need to accomplish they will tend to work hard and start receiving the information they desire. Also research gives a better understanding for the student to know what to find. Although some may say ""Information online may be false"" but there are multiple sites you can examine to observe the true facts.

Second reason, Goals help students with finding a career to start. Goals help by giving an idea to a student of what the second step is, to find the best career for them. Goals can be both limited and unlimited. Although some may say ""Students should start thinking after they graduate high school because there's many jobs in life students might pick the wrong job"", but starting young helps the teens mind to find different careers. Also students can decide what they would want to commit to.

Third reason, Acknowledging your goal will take a very important role of students life's. If students complete their goals, and research they can acknowledge their goal. Examine the work they have finished and look through to check if they are missing anything. After students have finished their steps students may continue on finding a job that they want from the data they collected. Finally acknowledging goals will help in examining job duties.

In conclusion students should start finding a job early. Starting young will help each individual student with, finding a job, how to determine if the job is right for you, and following along with accomplishing every goal. Students will have a less stressful time finding the right job. These 3 steps will help students find the right job: Goal, Researching, and Acknowledging their goals. Also it's a good idea for young students to have at least a couple ideas of what they want to do as a career after high school. ",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0

Why should we wait to finish something we can finish the same day, we never know what can happen. I also believe the inactivity is good not only does it give a chance to rest but we also can think through our ideas. We can perfect things we didnt think we could. It can give a chance to see different views of are own ideas. Maybe taking a break can refresh are memories and remind us how important things are to us. Woring all the time can exshuased ours bodys and make us think a little less. With a fresh mind set it can make things easier than we thought. Sometimes we over thinks that aren't that big of a deal and a big part of it comes from not taking the time to rest and refresh our memories.

92B8F2F85C44,"Although some say ""Unless you have try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Based on my experiences I do agree to Emerson's statement because life isn't easy you have to try new things in life, you have to risk yourself to walk through that bigger path and try not to look back to something you couldn't accomplish back than, instead look up, stand striaght and tell yourself ""I know I can master new/harder things that are to come my way.""

Some say if ""You don't try to do something beyond what you have already mastered you will never grow."" How are you suppose to grow if you haven't master something you can't accomplish? Life puts us in a sitution where not everything is going to be perfect, not everything is going to be rainbows and butterflies you have to challange youself, you have to show everyone that just cause you messed up once doesn't mean your going to make the same mistake again. You have to go through the rain to get to the rainbow, you have to be prepared for the big situtions that are coming your way. You have to learn how to handle the bigger situiton to know how to handle the smaller sitution when it comes to you. Don't let smaller things effect you at the end of the day the sun is still shinny brighter than ever, challange yourself so you can master and accomplish the situtions.

Therefore if you can't accomplish something you've tried so much you shouldn't give up but also don't stress about it too much either. If you think what your doing is the best than don't look back and keep doing what you've already started, life will be harder sometimes but it's up to you to show that you can master things you haven't been through. People might think you can't handle what your going through, people will laugh at you for not being able to master something that is easy for them but harder for you, you can't just stop trying just because you feel like you can't no more. Take a deep breath and I promise that at the end of the day you'll be happy because you master something you thoght you couldn't handle, but not only that you'll be happy because you didn't give up and you showed all these people that didn't beileve in you that you did it!

Others say that ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" I agree with this side of the argument because it's honestly the truth you have to master new things or you'll never see yourself growing, for an example if you just had an argument with your sigificate other and you break up with him/her your really just throwing things down the drain instead of sitting down to talk to that person to try to solve what went wrong. Try to master things so you grow not just kick things down the road and think that their going to come back to you. Maybe that was the first break up and he/she actually wants to break up, are you going to let her/him to let you go just like that or are you going to ask him/her for a reason? Get on their shoes, sometimes things happen for a reason and if what ever your going through hits you in the back of the head is for a reaon, don't confuse yourself on accomplishing something and showing off.

In conclusion some things might be harder for you than others but you shouldn't end up backing up and telling yourself you can't do it, that it's too hard. Instead you should do the opposite and tell yourself that you are better than what you think you is and that your going to master lots of things with or without someone by your side telling you ""You can do it."" This is my side of the statement I agree with and the way I look at things when I feel like I can't master big/small situtions.                         ",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,3.0
92CD1BD0C18F,"A good attitude is one of the most important things in life, because when you talking or do something with the best attitude you can see how everything is going great, and people feels good and comfortable with you. In the same time, it can open a lot of doors for you, and it can be a good opportunity for be a successful.

On the other hand, people believe that have a good attitude all the time is not a good idea, because some people will make use you, but most of the people who think like that don't have a success life; most of that people in the future feel depressing, feels like they don't do nothing with you life, they are not sucessful, and is something that every person needs thing about, you need prove that you can do it, that you can be a professional, and that you are more than people thing of you, because you need show people that is nothing imposible in life, that all your goals and dreams can makes real.

For example, a person work in a restaurant and you have a good attitude with the customers, you make them feel like in home, not waiting too long for their drinks and food, you will show them that you really happy for have them in there; in the other side, a person who works in the restaurant, don't smile to the customer, make they feel uncomfortable, and don't care about their drinks and food they don't going back to the restaurant or don't choice you for be their waitress, because you don't have a good attitude with your customers.

Also, make yourself a successful person, a person who the people want to talk, a person who a company want to you for work there, a person who do all ther goals and dreams, and a person who love himself, because you got love yourself, respect yourself, and try your best every single day, that is really impotant in your life. The attitude make you go for the best or wrong way, the best give you the best opportunity for a successful person; however, the bad give you the the work in where you do feel good, and where the best part of your day is when you go to the bathroom and use you phone for a couple minutes, when you got to life for check to check, that is the life of people who think the attitude is no the key of success, everyone don't reserve that, they reserve be happy, and have a good life with the people they love.

Is the same way in shool, talking about teacher and students, ""respect if you want respect back"", most of the students always have attitute with their teacher, they never respect them, but they want respect, a good attitude in school is the best thing we can do, because the teacher will help you more if they see you respect and really want to work, you are the person who need good grades, if you have a good attitude you will se the process in your life, in your classes, and your home. Also, in home, their parents need show and teach their kids that the attitude is the key of life, that they need have a good attitude if they want to be a good person in the future, that they want to be a professional, and be better person everyday, they will think on that, they will ask themselves why their parents try teach them that the attitude is important, and they will tray to have a good attitude for be a successul person.

In conclusion, the attitude is the key that will open all the doors you want, thats no matter what problems you have, when you do something you need doing with the best of you attitude, all is going to be perfect when you got a good attitute with people and with yourself. Try and see how your life is going for a straight way. They will enjoy their life, be happy with themselves and with the people around them, is all about how you acting, how you express yourself, and the way you talking with people, every person need make a different and show to everyone that the attitude is important to life, they will learn if the see that most of the people is doing it, try to make a different and see how everythinh is change for you.

I think that if you talk to more than one person for advice it will hep you more .One time i saw this quot by Lebron James that said if you need advice always ask more than one because one person could be right and the other could be not be right so dont be scared to ask more than one person there is noting wrong about asking the person you look up to. it will most likely be better if you ask multiple people for good advice.

If you are a person that does not like taking to other people you can just go to one person or you can try something different and ask someone else but if you just want to ask one person you have to go to someone you trust so they can give you some good feed back and good information. If i was to ask someone for advice i would go to a person that is very wise and makes smart choices so they can help me make a smart choice so i dont make the bad choices. If you need good advice make sure your going to the right person because you do not to be getting bad information if you have bad information you can make some bad choices.

Getting advice from one person can also be good because what if your telling them personal thing they can keep it a secret but if you tell multiple people your personal information can get out there and can start getting bulled and you would not be able to trust anyone again so that is why sometimes you just have to tell one person if it is important information. And if you just dont trust anyone you can just go to your consular because your consular will never share your information with anyone and she will under stand you more because it could of happen to her as a child so one person can also be helpful.

Dont forget asking for advice can always be useful if its one person or it multiple people it can still help you but if it is a person that does bad things and you ask him for advice he can tell you to do the things he does and you will turn out just like him so do not do to someone for advice if they dont make good choice. advice can change pepole live if it is good.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5

The Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", is well know that some people believe in this statement and some other don't. There are some reasons to believe this is true: one, failure gives experience to do it better next time, two, failure makes one think about different possibilities to be prepare to control the situation, three, failure gives the option to try again.

First, failure gives experience; this helps to learn how to dont make the same mistake. For example, to learn how to cook is a ""try and fail"" because one needs to put a specific amount of spices and vegetables is a long process to give the food a good flavor; failure said what are the mistakes one needs to correct like to dont put much sugar in the cake or dont put much salt in the salad. Another example, learn a new language is difficult in various forms like the pronunciation or the form to make a sentence; failure give experience to improve abilities like these too.

Second, failure makes one think about different possibilities. For example, if one try to built a ship inside a bottle and fail because the little pieces of the ship broke inside for dont be careful, that persons if going to think about what can make the pieces break next time to avoid the same situation. Another example, if one flew a kite and a bird or the wind make the kite crash, the next occasion ""what can make the kite crash?"" is going to be a possibility to think.

Third, failure gives the option to try again. For example, take a test driver and fail but still studying to take it again; to get the necessary score to pass, this show that person decide to try again. Another example, when one try to learn how to do a magic trick, the first times fail is guarantee, but with perseverance one can be the best magician, this can be only reached if one decide to try again after fail.

Although, one can learn from the failures, is not necessary fail to success, but sometimes one can't decide to don't fail; fail is a form to learn something from the mistakes, for example, fail to do something can make one know what is wrong and what is necessary to do to correct and prevent a future failure.

In conclusion, one dont need to fail to learn, but ""perseverance is the key for success"" and when one go from failure to failure without giving up; the action to dont give up show how capable is that person to success.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5

I say both because sometimes we choose to be who we are without nobody telling us what to do, what to say and not forcing us to do something we don't want to do. Choosing our character traits can be something hard for some people, because some of us think that we are going to be judged by other people and some of us think that we are not going to get accepted for who we are. Me I do both sometimes I choose my character traits and sometimes i'm influenced by other people, I don't think its good to be influenced by other people because I think we should be the one's controlling our character traits at all times. But sometimes we feel forced to do something we don't wanna do or say and it's not part of our character, But we feel we have to because there maybe someone watching or it could just be pure pressure, Doing stuff we don't always do that is basically getting influenced by other people because we are doing something that we don't really want to do. This is why I say it's both we choose and we are influence.

That's why Winston Churchill once said ""success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Some people say you could use your failures as your motivation and encouragement. In life, you will fail a lot of time but it's important that you keep fighting and learn from your mistakes.

To begin with, a lot of people thinks failure will only make you look bad and some thinks its the end of the world for them but that's not the case. Every each person make mistakes and having a motivation in your self will get your somewhere: however, when a person is lack of motivation in their life, they won't be as much successful and failure will take over.

Every each person in this world know that they're capable of, and every each person know what their weakness are.

Its is important because if student's know what they want to do in future, they can take classes in high school to help them do that career.

Knowing what you want to be in the future can help you out a lot, and you do what you like to do, and on my opinion knowing what you want your career to be gives you a advantage in the future.

For some people it isn't a problem to go to high school without know what there going to do in the future. They try to find out what what they like, and what they dont like as a career for the future. Some people go to college not knowing what they want to do and find out till there in college. My sister is one of them because she went into college not knowing what she wanted to do or be, but once she started going to college she found out what she wanted to do which was a ultra sound doctor. Now that she knows what she wants to do she studying and trying to reach her goal as being a ultra sound doctor.

If you already have a mindset on what you want to do you can set goal's for yourself, and once you reach those goal's set harder ones to reach. You can set many type's of goal's like one day owning a 5 bedroom house or owning your dream car. You can set goal's with what ever you want like in the future, present, at school , anywhere.

If your still in school a goal you can set is getting a and b honor roll or turning in all your work or even showing up to class everyday. One of my goal's is to own my first car before I graduate which is a Lexus Is300 2001. Setting goal's is important in life, and Ithink everyone should set some goal's for themselve's.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5
99961D273689,"Do you think you give off right by having a negative attitude? Imagine being at the DMV everyone given you stares, and your family telling you ''you're not gonna pass"". As you sit taking the test ,all those comments replaying in your head. Can you see the difference? as if i was to be possitive, my attitude reflects off of what i give, and that is the key of success in life.

A positive vibe can make your days go faster. Everyone in this world has challeges, but i mean who doesn't? so with that being said we can overcome with putting effort and what you do or believe. The ability to have a positive attitude creates a mind set of trying new things, like driving, traveling, last but not least, education. Adjusting to a new enviroment helps alot with mental health.

My story starts with me going to the DMV. something i notice was, i was hearing negative comments about me not passing my test. My friends kept telling me that is was difficult and hard. Meanwhile at the time, it kept replaying in my head, and i reacted in a negative way.

One way we can avoid being gloomy is to stop hanging out with people who are bad influence, because if we do we give off the same energy. However if you will have potential on succeeding,and you well feel much better of your self.

Some people say that being negative is normal, but they are wrong because if you are always negative everyday that will not take you enywhere. It is always good to be positive, and if you are positive all things go well. In conclusion, is how we the people should change the way we see things, and move foward for better result. I hope that we can be more considerate on how we take things in life.                                  ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5

I do agree on what Ralph Waldo statement said,""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" You should always push yourself to the max on everything you do. Try finding a better and faster way to solve what you already mastered. Work even harder then you worked before. Also try something more harder than the previous thing you did. For example Lebron James, he wasn't rich or wealth when he was little, he had to work hard to get where he is now. Lebron trained everyday to get better, stronger, and put his best on the basketball court so he can stand out from the rest. Even today Lebron James is training to be come the best NBA player ever and works really hard to beat/break other famous NBA players records. Each NBA superstars have different stories to tell on how they got there. Not only just NBA players work hard, other people around the world has stories to tell on how they never stopped working harder than before to grow. .These are the reasons and examples on why I do agree with Raplh Waldo statement.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
9ADC4A3BFDD0,"Taking classes online or video conferencing is one of the best way to help students,who can not afford to go to college and for older people that couldn't get the chance to further their education because of their financial state. Financial issues has become one of the problem in this generation of mankind, whereby students either have to pay to live on campus or out of campus to further their education,which has caused a lot of students out of school dorms because, they struggle to pay for them. Most students have daily jobs to help them afford to pay the bills, based on their level of education. Working and schooling is a difficult task on students because, one have to make time for school and work to be able to make everything easier and stress free.

Transportation and parking space has also been an issue for some reason, why some students prefer to take online classes from home to prevent them from being late to class. Colleges with large mass of land may not have enough parking space for students and we also believe that, not every student own a car or any type of moving vehicle where by one needs to park. when one is being able to attend classes from home, they get the chance to begin their lesson anytime during day after a long stressful day.

Students benefit from being able to attend classes online from home because, they accomplish more and get worked done faster in due time. With less distractions, they understand and enjoy the lesson, it helps them concentrate and more focus on what is being taught to them. They get to ask questions online, they also get more time to go over the lesson again to the right state of understanding the lesson. Lecturers reduce a lot on online students with less work and projects for them to have be ready for other assignments being given to them.

Taking classes online or video conferencing gives one enough to take care of other things, to be on time for lectures, help other students that couldnt go to college to feel they also have the right to achieve their goal once in a life time and to help others without transportion save money and more organised and time managment.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0

Elementary students can probably do it because they might not have anything to do because they still in elementary and they probably have time to pick up litter or maybe jr high students can help too if there not to busy maybe some of the students that don't play any sports can probably help too. In some schools the principals are probably gonna require all the students to do community services because how they probably act or maybe she or he gonna make they bad people do community service. People like me can probably do it on weekends just to help others because im always busy during the week. The principals should make the people who act bad during the week and during the weekend that will probably help them change a lot they gonna get tired of picking up litter and doing community service.,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5

The students we should to consider for what they permit us use our cell phone in the class, and they give us the opportunity and don't spend our time and others things and we should focus in our work.

Many student's when the teacher said you gays can use your phone in the class for search information or some work sometimes that we do is play video games, or see Facebook, Instagram or something else and we don't focus in that the teacher said in the classroom, and spend our time and things that affect us.

For example i know a person when i was in my country when we are in the class the teacher said search information in internet that story of this person or when we was in math class, uses our phone for the calculator but there was one girl that she never do that the teacher say and she start to see Facebook and send messages to his friend that are in the same class and that affect the persons who her is message sometimes there is students that they absolutely do that the teacher say or the school and that case, is really good idea use the cell phone cause help us in the class or to have more information about something that we want to know for example in my case i am a person that don't have too much time in this country, and sometimes when i am reading in my English class and find one word or sentence what i dont know what is that means i need search information about that for understand what am doing, is the same in my math class too much times i dont know how traduce symbols and need use my phone for that i think of that way is very good, school permit us use our cell phone too can be the best way for learn more things and makes our work in the way that the students likes also can be more helpful for the student's and also for the teacher's.

I think all depends of the student, use cell phone in class can affect or also can be good idea for learn in the school the school give us the opportunity, that use our phone we should that feel grateful for the opportunity and uses the phone for the work not for other things what can do that our grades come down.

9BF2607D4878,"The statement is ""the first impression is almost impossible to change"" which is a different feeling for everybody, but for me, I disagree. In fact, the first impression is really important and sometimes true, but I think the first impression does not define a person, an object or a situation. Having a first impression is a human reflex, like having an opinion or a judgment. We are doing it unconsciously.

The first impression is most of the time not real, you need to search deeper to make an opinion and when you really have an opinion, then, the first impression is not important anymore. For example, when you meet someone, your first impression might be that you think she is supercilious and even a little bit mean. Therefore when you really get to know her deeper then you will find that she just had a bad day and that she is nice and sociable. Sometimes it's the contrary, a person seems really nice but in reality she is not, so your first impression was wrong. It is not good to stay on a first impression because most of the time it's wrong.

Moreover, the physic, behaviors or attitude can change an impression. If the person do not smile and seems to be rude but in reality is the nicest person, then it will be awkward for you because you thought she was bad. Sometimes a person can have a bad reputation because of the first impression he shows and it is not his fault, some persons just don't smile every time. Sometimes you can be disappointed because you didn't get to know the person because of your first impression.

The first impressions is not only for people but also for a situation or an object. For example if you are in a library and you want to buy a book, the first thing you are going to do is looking at the cover of the book. If it's pretty you will more easily choose this one instead of a book with a black cover and only the title, because it is your first impression. But your first impression is wrong because you didn't take time to read the resume and you will find soon that the pretty book is actually boring instead of the black book which is really interesting. An object can look nice but have a bad quality. The first impression is the color and the shape of the object, like the physic and the attitude of a person.

In conclusion I would say that the first impression is sometimes right but most of the time it's not. In my opinion, you must not keep in mind your first impression of a person, it's most of the time wrong. You have to get to know the person to build your own opinion. It is normal to have a first impression, like judging, but you must not take the habit to stick with your first impression.      ",4.5,4.5,5.0,4.5,4.5,4.0

To grow more as a person people have to try different things because the most things they do the more experience they get. If a person mastered something already he will feel that he know everything but the true is that he only know whay he mastered, but if a pereson try different thing he would get more experience that can be use in the future.

an example of this is Pique. He is a famous soccer player. he get pay a lot of money, but to grow more as a person. he also become a busines man. Now Pique have a lot of companies that work for him. he also created his own Tennis league in Spainh. Pique also support a fundation that his wife created to help kids in Colombia.

Other example is one of my uncles from Generic_City. his mane is Generic_Name. He study to be a teacher. He was very happy with his work, but to grow more and get more knowledge he go back to college to study to become a doctor. Now he feel like he know more and that he have grow more as a person.

I also like to thing that I'm a example of this. I always try to do my best to leard different sports. I'm a really good soccer player, but I prefere to try others sports. I play a different sport everyday because I feel that this will help me to become a better player and will give me the experience to grow more as a athlete. I also like to to study a lot for the classes that I'm having problems because I get more knowledge about different topics and make me grow more as a student

He grow as a person by doing what he already mastered.

people have to do different things in their life's if they want to grow as a person because if they think they are the best is a lie. They are the best in what they mastered, but they don't have any type of knowledge in other thing. In conclution if someone wants to grow more as a person.

Do we accomplish more if we are doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Keep doing something helps you get a chance to accomplish and also makes the time you spend out is worthwhile.

Determine means you have reached a decision. Firstly, once you have determined yourself, you will know what to do forward. For example, you are having trouble with your weight so you are planning to be fitness. You spend two hours a day going to the gym or go jogging every early morning. As the result, you will lose weight and have a nice body. Secondly, determination can be a supporter for you to reach your goal. For example, you are a senior in high school and you want to graduate this year; however, you are having trouble with your grades. You try to improve it by asking teachers and you friends, or you go studying online and do some practices at home. If you do that everyday, you will get good grades and graduate.

Determine can also make your time more worthwhile. Imagine after all the time you have to spend on doing something are now accomplished, you will feel very pleasant and proud of yourself. The more time you work, the worth time you pay. Otherwise, it can make you have more patience in life. You will not stop chasing on what you want to do although you have to face many problems in life. Therefore, you both get good accomplishment also a better personality.

In the other hand, being idle in determining makes you are a useless person. You will have no job, no money, neither future. For example, you need to buy a house but you have no money. Instead of finding a job, you do nothing, which makes you waste time and get nothing for your benefit. Beside that, idleness will make you have no respect from people. Although people are working and getting success, you just sit there and get failure.

As an example for that could be, that every time people is not using a light at their house they must turn it off. Also when students use their computers at school for a long time just playing games and charging it, it's a waste of energy. Not every body understand how important the energy is. This is why bussinesses and schools should adopt a four-day week, with each day consisting of then hours.

Having a four-day work week has their benefits. Workers would only work four days and have three day weekend, they would have more time to rest, and have a time with their families. On the other hand working requires using energy for any type of power tools as computers, printers, and construction tools. Working four days a week will decrease the use of energy.

Also some people drive to their job, and others ride the bus, using this method of working only four days a week will safe the people more resources, as gasoline, money, and vehicles.

As working four days a week has their benefits, it also has their disadvantages. students would have to go school, and workers would have to go to work only four days a week, of each day consisting of ten hours. Students would have to stay at school two more hours, meaning they would waste more energy as they usually do. Workers would waste a very big amount of enegy due by the power tools they use. Students would only go to school for four days, and wokers to work for only four days as well, but each day constis in ten hours, however they still will work for forty hours, as if they worked five days a week, workers and studets will be wasting the same amount of energy and resources.

Being a student and going to school for only four days a week and having a three day weekend has their benefit. Students would have more time to complete their homework, and study for tests. On the other hand going to school requires to waste some energy, and resources, students uses their computer that they need to charge, and teachers uses paper every day, while using this method students and tacher would safe resources and energy. Some students drive to school, others take the bus, or they also drive to academies, this all relates to the wasting of energy and resoruces as gasoline. Otherwise going to school for only four days a week, will decease all the energy used in computer, and the gasoline the cars need to get students to school.

Students going to school only four days a week has their benefits and disadvantages. Students would waste less energy than they do in five days, they aslo would waste less gasoline and money if they only come four days. Having this method the comminuty would safe a lot of energy and resources that can be need it for the future. Schools should follow this model by extending the school days two hours and waste less energy and resources. ",2.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5

A1BFCDA12FB1,"People should make their own decisions about life's important matters. i agree with this statement because once people get older as a person they know what they are doing and what they want. another reason is high school, people are a teenagers and people are still learning, but sometimes make mistakes. moreover when people are eighteen they start to make important choices and actions about their life.

When a person gets older they learn between right and wrong. for example a person should never spend their money on something they don't need and knowing if they do they'll be broke and have financial problems. people know what are the needs and wants in life, they learn this through out life and the one to make the decisions.

High school is where people start to have an idea or know what you wanna do as a career. In high school you get to meet a lot of people and make new friends, in addition you make a lot of decisions. The decisions people make and ask their self are, should i be friends with this person, should i go to this class, and sometimes people don't wanna continue school. more over people wanna experience a party in high school so they sometimes make the decision to go and drink or do drugs, but end up getting in serious problems. In the end people make the decisions.

When a person turns eighteen they are an adult now and probably out of high school. People are either in collage or working when eighteen. That's a decision people make before graduating and thats a very important life choice. Sometimes people make the decision not to go to collage or sometimes go to collage then drop out and thats a decision a person makes because they think its the best for them.

in conclusion people make decisions and learn from it. People know between right and wrong, need and wants, and what they wanna do in life. You also make mistakes in life and sometimes you need to make that mistake in order for you not to make the same decision again. At the end of the day people know what they want in life and know the decisions they make. Guidance from others is a idea or option, people will still have to make the decisions.

A1DC92E4E3C8,"In the United States, the limitation to human contact due to technology has had a positive effect on people's lives. in mordern times, technology has been very helpul to everyone. Technology performs multi-tasks without physical contacts with others. Due to this, people don't have to go to stores to get groceries and other materials. This is especially convenient for older ones because they are weak and stressing themselves could cause heart diseases and even death. But now they sit home and order anything, saving their health.

Secondly, technology has gone to the highest level. Today one could stay at home and socialize with friends and family without physical contact. Technology has provided social media apps making it easier to communicate without making human contact. Besides communication, people feel safer talking about their rights, the government and politics in general on social media than in public. In cases of emergency, social media has been proved to be the fastest way of saving lifes, accidents, and most importantly many deaths.

Obviously, technology has made it possible for kids who don't like school, and are poor learners at school due to the nature of the environment to learn online at home giving them another opportunity to become something great. Even though they don't make physical contact with friends, they are provided a better learning environment, less stressful activities, and the motivation to learn more and become a contribution to the society's well being which evryone today wants. Again this brings us to the good part about social media, though kids may not have physical contacts with friends, they have the social media.

A2957D006D28,"It has been said that the first impression are almost impossible to change. I disagree because when you look at a person for at three seconds you think you know that individual already, Until you have a conversation with him/her for at least ten seconds your whole impression will change with a ""blink of a eye"". However, I disagree the first impression is almost impossible to change. The reason why is that the way a person looks, personality, and there way communication skills are all ways that can change your whole point of view of a individual. From your first impression when you look at them.

However the way a person looks from your first impression isn't always who they really are. Base on you information on someone aren't ever really true. Meaning looks can be deceiving. Ex. The guy/girl could be the cutest person you ever seen and you really want to meet them. Until they were the worst nightmare and you hate them with a passion. This also works vice verse. Ex. The guy/girl could be the ugliest person of the time, but you never gave them the time of day. Until you met them and started talk to each other. That's when you realize that this person is the one for you. It's like saying don't judge a book at its cover. Until you opened it and read it. That's when you really like this book. Sometimes a personality can be a huge factor on your first impression.

Neverless personality can change your first impression. Personality is mostly made up of whom you are. The basic qualities, and beliefs you have on a individuals. Find out who someone can be a life changing event for yourself not knowing who someone really is can have a big affect on you, because you really don't know who you are dealing with. Personality provides great insight into individuals and their lives. Being honest no matter what with someone can build a strong first impression on yourself and the person right in front of you. Showing the courage to do what's right in those situations, being loyal at your friends and love ones are good ways to boost you relations with another individual. Having the drive to keep going can rise-up your personality and your first impression to a different climax. Communication is key to your first impression.

Furthermore, communication skills consist of verbal and non-verbal by transferring information to another individual. Communication involves displaying confidence, and passion to show that you understand the individual topic by being eye contact and hearing all information that they are telling you. By you giving your honest opinion on a situation can grater your chances being with that individual, when keeping an open mid and resisting to give your quick judgments are clear signs of good communication skills.

Additionally. I disagree that first impression is almost impossible to change. The reason why is that the way a person looks, their personality,

and their communication skills are all ways that can change your whole point of view on a person. In other words, looks can be deceiving personality because being honest no matter what is key, and communication skills are caused by you first impression. Therefore by taking the time, day, hours, and efforts to get to know someone can benefit you from not judging book by its cover.            ",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0
A2EF5BCC488B,"Some people think that when they master at something they've never mastered at, then they will grow up. That is what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson said in his quote. ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.

An example of this statement are babies starting to walk. Then they achieve at it, then they will start talking. From that point on, they will grow into toddlers where they will learn about letters, numbers, how to share with others, and some easy words to pronounce. When they get to kindergarten, they will learn about math, reading, and writing. Upon growing into teenagers, they will learn about harder math skills like harder math, reading, and they will even apply for a job. When they grow into 10th graders, they will learn about business, marketing, and learning to drive. A similar experience I had was when I was starting Automotive Technology was when I learned about how to operate tools like wrenches, ratchets, how to lift up and carry things like tires, how to use safety equipment, and how to operate electric tools like machines, impact guns, and drills. It was scary at first, but overtime, I've been continually practicing using these tools, and now I'm an expert at using these equipments. Another experience I had was when I was doing chores like cleaning, vacuuming, washing the dishes, and taking out the trash. I can do these chores without having a family member like my mom asking me to do it.

Another reason why Emerson's quote is correct is because if you continue practicing at something you've neve excelled at, you excel at it, then you will continue mastering at it. It will make people happy that they achieved at it. A similar experience I had was when I was in my elementary school years when I was eating dinner with my family. Back then, I used to eat a lot, and that is still true today. I would finish almost everything from meat, soup, etc. My family was impressed at how much I've eatan. As a result, I grew so much that I was taller than most of my family members, and it's still true today. I continue to eat a lot and I will eat more in my future. Another experience I had was in elementary school. In elementary school, I learned about mathematics from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Back then, it was a little tough at first, but I kept practicing, and now I can excel at this.

In contrast of Emerson's quote, if people keep practicing, but they don't seem to achieve it, it might make them feel upset and defeated. However, to remedy that, if people continue practicing at something challenging, there is a higher chance that they will achieve at it. It will certainly make people joyful that they achieved it.

As Emerson said in his quote, if you try your best or master at something you've never excelled at, then you will grow up and feel joyful about it. By continually practicing, you will most likely achieve at it.",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5

In this prompt I thinki that Tomas Jefferson was triying to said is that people have to determinate to never be idle to always do something, because after that you will see how much things you may done, and there always 2 types of people . The pople who would be agrere or not agree with this frase. That is why some people may think that is not always necessary to do something or work hard for things that we want, because they think that we can work for our things when is their necessary time . Also some people may think that you need to do something when things are really necessary or when you want something. I hardly believe that the frase that Tomas Jefferson wrote is totally true. We need always been working in our life to get wonderful thing , as he said is wonderful how much we can done whit things if we are always doing something for it. It is also that we that he worote that sentences, because I can totally feel how he specificly said "" Determinate never to be idel "" I take that sentence like never let yourself be that.

In the world are so many people negative that always think that we cannot get that things that we want that is always the reason why people become lazy with their dream , because they always think with negativily.

there are many people outside looking for a excuse to be idle.

In conclusion I hardly believe that I'm totally agree with Tomas Jefferson because we can keep working or doing something because after that, we would see the things that we have done or our resuts that our hard work. Just we need to keep doing something or working for something great in our future as a person succeful that we want to be.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0
A38187259EEE,"For my own opinion , I think most students that have problems at school should take online or video classes at home to make it easier for them to learn and study.

Most students that are special , speaks different language or problems could and should take online classes. Even if you don't have problems you could take online classes if you wanted too. You dont have to go to school and learn , you stay home and learn in the computer. Homeschooling and online classes could be different but the sames at the same time. Learning at home could be better for you. Because at school cause you dont have no one to bother you , or giving you bad ideas , or cause trouble at schools on you learning experiences.

Some students would have benefits from being able attend classes from home? Some benefits could be like. "" What if its a bad idea to do it ? "" , "" What if I don't do good at it ? "" or "" What if I can't do it at home or at school ? "". Some have different ideas that it could be better for them to learn. At school it mighty be different cause there a lot of teacher and students that be different than you. At online school your at home with your parents and siblings? ad have only one teacher that teaches you on the computer. Its your dession to choose school to learn or online whatever that you comfortable for you to learn.

For me if I could choose , I'll choose going to school. Why? because its more better for me to learn from a teacher in person and see what they are do for me to learn. Online its okay , but staying at home make me get lazy and too comfortable by staying home. So for me to learn , is by going to public or private school are better for me to learn , educate , and socialize to others , its better for me.

So online classes are not for everyone. Like me I perfer going to school , not taking classes online. But what I say

"" whatever that make you comfortable for you to learn "". For me is going to school learn amd talk to other students. Wahtever you chosses for you to do then do it. Online classes are greate! but for dome people don't think so, So my option are both some students benifets to do online or some doing it school. ",2.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5
A3A0AB366927,"Working idenpendently is harder than working as a group, but it's also better to learn things. Etheir working as a group or not you are still getting work done, and learning as you go. When I state that you can ""learn"" it means that you can find out things especially as a group where everyone has they're own ideas and facts about topics. Some people just take working as a group as an advantage to just copy and get answers just to get things done. Copying others does not help you learn anything other then getting your work completed.

I think it is better working alone beacuse it would be better for me to learn. Yes, i'd probably take a long time getting it done just because I would be taking my time finding little details. Some people choose not to work independently but I do. One reason why I think it is better to work alone is because of the fact that after your done you'll feel relieved and happy. If you did what you had to do alone without anybodys help besides the person who gave you the assignment, or job whatever than you done a good job just by doing your work independently.

Working as a group isn't bad I just suggest it should be better for students or anyone to work idependently also to learn what their doing instead of just getting it done when you can learn and get it done. Some people end up just copying off someone else to get stuff done. Others they actually do it and share with others who actually also have stuff done to share. Not everyone copies, nor cheats just alot of people such as students take working as a group an advantage to copy. Working together as a group can be much more easier than alone but still working independently is much more helpful for your learning benifits.

Anyone who is not used to doing independent work gets a little kick on working alone because their so used to working as a group. It helps people push them selves on finding more details, facts, and clues for what they need. If you do struggle of course you can obvisouly ask a teacher or anyone for a hand in help because you could be stuck on something. You can focus more on your work while your alone because if your in a group working it gets you distracted. If you hear other students or people talking to you, and the rest of the group giving each other ideas while your focued to find your own ideas gets you to unfocused.

Somebody elses ideas in the group could be wrong, and when you write them and use those ideas you could be wrong as well. People usually rely on others to get answers which is not right. Also it's hard for others to communicate with others as a group which it also makes it better for anyone to work alone. You could do things your own way while working independently. All of the things I wrote about help show that it is better to work independently than with others in a group.                        ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5
A3E6A572C6E5,"Do you remember a time where whether it was your parents, teacher, or someone very close to you excepts you to be something that you are not? According to me, every parents wants their kids to be perfect, wonderful, and hard working. Every parents wants to see them successes in life, and be happy, but what they don't understand is how much pressure and anxiety they put on their child. I remember a time where i was under so much stress and pressure because my parents wanted me to be this perfect, wonderful, and hard working person just so i could be the best torture.

Do you remember a time where you wanted to do something so bad, but everyone else wanted you to do something that you don't even like and want. I remember a very good friend of mine name Generic_Name, wanted to be an artiste, but every one in her family wanted her to be a doctor. We all know that being a doctor is not an easy job. sure you get high salary but being a doctor is not about getting high salary or wearing the white uniform is about carrying for others and enjoying your time with others . But Generic_Name's family didn't understand that all they care about was her getting in medical school and be a doctor. Generic_Name is very smart, carrying, and wonderful person. because of her family pressure her to be a doctor she let her dream go and now is suffering very much, because she doesn't want to be a doctor she wants to be an artiste something that she wanted to do her whole lives. That's why we should never pressure someone to be something that they are not.

dreaming and working hard to be something that you always dreamed of is very hard when you have people, who constantly try to make something out of you that you know that you are not. One example of that is when i was little i always dreamed of becoming the greatest dancer at all time, but everyone was against what i wanted to do. i remember i had to set down and have word with my family i had to explain to them why i want to be what i want to be. I was under so much pressure, stress, and anxiety that i thought i was in a war with my own family. Everything i said or do they use it against me it was very sad, angry, depressed, and unhappy moments, but i get though it i did become a dancer, i did something that i thought i could never do, and i didn't let anyone to shut me down with their words or actions. The lesson that we could learn from my story is not to stand against your family and disrespected, them, but no to allow anyone to take your dream away from you. Always stay strong and never give up.

""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" According to me every person in this world have the right to speak their mind and do whatever they wish or desire. No one should every try to make you something that you are not. In today's world we people try to make changes in others life by trying to make them something that they are not and that's where we lost loves one, friends and family just because we choice to do things we wanted insisted taking their advice and changing our path. We should be doing the thing we love and dreamed of no one has the right to tell you otherwise. You should never change yourself to make others happy or to show them you care about them, because if they really care about you they will accepted you for you.

Changing yourself for other just so could show them your carrying, perfect, and happy is not love. Everyone has the right to be happy in their lives and we should accepted them they way they are. To give you an example of what i am talking about is i had a friend name Generic_Name he was very hard working guy who was loved by everyone in the community. Generic_Name was born in single family he was living with his mom and two younger brother. Generic_Name's mom was a wonderful women who was loves by everyone. Generic_Name was the older child so he had a lot of responabilty he had to work to provide for his family, he had to go to school, and take care of his younger brothers'. when Generic_Name get accepted to college he wanted to study biology but his mom wanted him study music but Generic_Name was never interested in music. he want to learn about living and nonliving things, but Generic_Name's mom never agree with him she told him"" you have to study music and that's that."" Generic_Name was my best so when he told me about his problem i told him"" Listen Generic_Name i know you love your mom so much, but do what you love to do will make you happy and you don't have to be something that you are not interested in because you will suffer in the future"". Generic_Name loved his mom so much he didn't want to make her sad so we he went to college and he study music, but he never like what he was doing because he was born to be a biologist. The lesson to learn in this story is to never give up your dreams for your loved ones because once you started doing something there is no way back.

In the future knowing that you did something for yourself and knowing that no matter what other said you did what you love to do is the greatest accomplishment that you could ever accomplish. Some say to be yourself is not the great accomplish but i disagree with that because being yourself, not losing hope, not giving up, and fighting with others trying not to be something that they are make you to be is the greatest accomplishment.

Students may choose a career, and later on say they dont like the courses they have to take. Some students might even feel way to much pressure having to pick a career at a young age. Others may argue and say that having picked a career at that point, and be sure about it may feel that they are ahead of everyone else and prepared for the future. Others students might have only picked that career, because their friends have chosen the same career. Students may feel overwhelmed, and not like or take serious the career and courses they have.

Students may choose a career and later on say they dont like the courses they have to take. They might feel like that is not the correct path for them. Some change their mind because they may feel like the courses are to hard, or that the amount of work is too much. Others may change because their parents might not agree with that career, because its to complicated. Students may not have fully made up their mind yet if they even want to keep studying anything after high school. In addition, if students change their mind once they might keep changing their mind again and again, because they want to experiment other careers and courses.

Some students may feel way to much pressure having to pick a career at a young age. Kids may get stressed or even overwhelmed with knowing they have to choose something. As well,some students might already have jobs and it could be tiring. Some students could experience great amounts of anxiety, because they may feel forced to take those courses to succeed later in life. Furthermore, students may not like that feeling when they have to pick and rather give up. Some schools could help pick, but students may not like that and feel more pressure. For example, just having to pick regular classes for the year is somethings to really think about, because you wanna take easy classes but yet succeed as well. Adding on, having to pick your career in even harder and super stressful.

Others students might have only picked that career, because their friends have chosen the same career. They might think that its cool and fun, but not realize that it is a bad idea. While they start to spend more time together they could get super annoyed and agitated with one and other. Some of them might have actually like the career they chose and want to do good in the courses they take. In addition, the ones who actually want to take the classes and succeed wont let them if they get annoyed at each other. Teachers and parents may even realize that it wont be a good idea for other peers.

In conclusion, having to pick a career to succeed could be stressful. Students might not be able to enjoy their teen years, because they are focused on other things. Other may also agree that being prepared for the future and having plans is a good thing, and young adults can be prepared for it. Other may disagree and say that kids need some freedom and enjoy life as young adults.

this classes are a good way to teach students different careers that they may like to study in their future for example engineering,plumbing, or any other higher education, another reason why letting students take classes that guide them for a future career is that by the time they reach college they will know a little about the career they choose to study.

some students that had been guided in their high school are in a higher chance to graduate in that career.

For example in hospitals technology evolves every year so that when people come in very sick it helps them by detetecting what they have or whats going on with a accurate solution.

However people may say that technology has negative effects on people because it removes there social skills and the way people interact with each other because in older generations there was a lack of technology and people would communicate with others when they were in need of something. In contrast humans also have a choice to check out books,shop and play games without human contact. Many people still go out and shop in stores many also enjoy going to the libary to check out books even though we can't go to blockbuster and check out movies anymore we can always go watch one in a movie theater. Technology has come a long way from its past and it continues to progress and evolve every year we move up as we continue to progress the future might be filled with just technology.

The way i use technology are in many different ways i put a alarm to wake me up i also use my computer when im doing home work or projects that i need to finish its also useful when im stuck or dont know what something means so i use my phone and search it up online to find the meaning of a word or subject. In my opinion i think its very helpful and positive to my life it has helped me in many ways and it gets me through also in school activities i dont think it has impacted me to a negative side because going to go play soccer or doing something else has not stop me from socializing with others around me. In conclusion technology can be very helpful or in some ways bad for peoples lives i think that technology no matter what will just get better and help many other just like it has helped me.

A88FB1D1C8BD,"According to Ralph Waldo Emerson, so I am here to support the motion which says....''

To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplish''

. Before going to the point,I will like to let you know the meaning of accomplish

.ACCOMPLISH IS WHAT YOU FULFILL,

leaving your real life in this world will surely makes you accomplish or fulfill what you want in this life. For instances; I have seen a girl leaving a fake life to accomplish what see want, but at the end of the day she was caught, their is a company who need someone who is rich and popular to be the director of the company and will be paid thousand of dollars every week. This lady try to live a fake life and decided to go for the post, when she got there every single person believes that she is rich and famous,and she has to compete with other lady who doesn't lives a fake life. she is so poor but have the work experience and was talented,after some days,weeks and month. It now the time to choose the leader,they both seat separately with their heart beating vastly,the lady living a fake life have the 100% assurance that she will wi the contest, here comes the judges to call our the winner,the speaker gives a speech about each of them. The speech goes as; After we have camp both ladies for some month will we sure;y choose the leaders but here with me some evidence about those ladies,their is girl among you two who lives a fake life to get what she want and there is another girl who didnt do that, this position is given to the girl who does not leave the fake live because if this position is given to you who live fake life you will surely ruin this company by embezzled and faking this company,the speaker says she borrowed almost $500,000 from banks,two house and 3 brand new cars to fake her life and at the end she did not accomplish what she want,likewise the other girl who be herself in this world and finally fulfill her dream and have greatest accomplishment.

With this little words of mine i will like to convinced not to confused you that living your real life in this live that is constantly trying to male you something else is the greatest accomplish but if you try and fake your life in this world you will never accomplish anything than public disgrace if you later got caught.",2.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0
A8DFA8766B31,"I think for my opinion students should and shouldn't use their phones at school. because the good thing about it is faster and its easier because students now days use their phones every day. The bad things about students using their phones in class its that it could be a distraction for them doing their work and many more things.

The bad things about students using their phones are that students wouldn't pay attention in class and would be lazy to do their work at school, thats why the schools have computers and a library's so we could look up information for their subjects. Its a distraction and wouldn't let them learn or do their work. cause now in these days all teenagers use their phone for everything. Lets say if the teacher let the students use their phone so they can look up information for their work. Im pretty sure mostly of the students would be doing something is like being on social media or texting their friends. Thats why school is a place to get your education by learning and paying attention.

Even students now this days they get mad if the teacher ask for their phone cause they use it allot in class. Students learn more faster by reading n doing their work and using their head. Cause if they use their phone they going to be looking up the answers. I think what should teachers do is that they should give their phone to the teacher once you get into class and once the class ends he should give it to you back. Another bad things about phones is that they use them on the test to look up the answers n dont try.

The good things about using your phones is that it easier to use then a computer and it so much faster. I think students should be allowed cause you could learn from their n look up information or things that you dont understand in class and you could find another way of learning and different ideas. The other good reason your better on typing on phone then using computer.

I think its a good and a bad idea cause with your phone its quicker to use then a computer but the bad thing about its a distraction to student. Cause they would putting more attention to their instead of the teacher. And student get distract with their phone cause they access to social media at the same time. And student would cheating on test cause they would be looking up the answers. Students now in this days have to use their phones less cause they use them every day n not their and thats the reason they dont learn.",3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5
A9290F062546,"I believe, what Thomas Jefferson wrote about "" determine never to be elder ""

because we would never know how can we impact on someone life or in our life.

never say never , don't stop doing what you love, just because some people won't appreciated your work. Two example why no to stop doing you, you could make people happy, people could also learn how to become better on someone's life, and even you never give up, just do you and you will see the result at the end.

First of all, I'ts amazing how much may be done if you always doing something. Every minute, hours, seconds, and days is important, because we can do a lot in like 10 min. Stop thinking to much don't wasted. I always like to keep my self busy. Specially if is about soccer. Take care of your self, your body needs energy, fun things to do, so that way you and your brain don't feel irritating. Personally, like 10 years ago my cousin die because he's girlfriend didn't want to with him, for the fact that he only thing he could do was using drugs and nothing appropriated., we found him on a tree.

In addition, this is why don't stop doing something. Who knows probably a girl/ guy could fall in love with you, or you could also make people feel strong for whatever situation you could be you will see the result at the end. Keep doing what the people with illness do, never give up, they always have an smile on their face. Even people famous they kill their self because they feel alone, because they don't interact with the community, or with fun people that could make their life happy and easier.

In conclusion, I agree on what Thomas Jefferson wrote. Personally I don't waste time, I keep doing me, I am always doing something for example, school , work and I also play soccer for the Generic_City recreation soccer. My advice for you is that if you don't something similar of what happen with my cousin, take care of your self, keep yourself busy as much as you can.                   ",2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.0,3.0
A9A6B5A288DC,"Should some people believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the student's best effort. They believe that students must be self-confident in order to learn. I agree with students must be self confident because its better to grow in life then stay in the same place over and over again. If a student does not believe in what he or she can do then that student will not be able to compete things in that student's life time. Also a builds a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward. Students should have self-esteem for a successful life.

If a student doesn't believe in what he or she can do then that student will not be able to compete things in that student's life time. Student that doesn't think that their capable of doing more that student will stay the same and would not be able to grow, also that student self-esteem will lower down. Another thing a student should getting moving up and high than he or she can do is there are no limits in what that person can do if the student knows that they would be able to do what they can do they can easily grow by practicing more and believing they can do it. So by not believing in what he or she can do that will affect what will happen later in life, never stop believing in what he or she can do as a student.

Building a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward. To have a good self-esteem the student will have to set up goals to show to their self that that student can do more. Another thing after writing down their goals is which one will they do first or which one is do he or she want to compete first. With all the choices to choose like for example: goals, friends or family that support, or how will is the student want to succeed, because even if they don't try as hard as they know how to it could happen to anyone in life that shouldn't make a student to stop trying it should make them feel like okay it wasn't my best my first time he or she can get the second time because a student should always chase what they are willing to have. Building a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward is good for a student to have a great self-esteem. The reason students should be praising for their self-esteem is, because no students should say no to even if it's not their best work the first time everyone should have a chance to have a great self-esteem and to keep growing in life.",2.5,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5
AA1ED5376761,"Success is said to be hard with a negative attitude, but why should attitude define the destiny of a person? Life is full of surprises but with a good attitude you can overcome just about anything. A great attitude isn't obtained by many but it certainly isn't hard to get. All success in life leads back great attitude and awesome mentality. The Key to success is to have a positive attitude and mind set because the person with a positive attitude will gain a healthier life style, a better career, and money.

Positive attitude comes from a good mentality and when people have that they see life differently. People who have this characteristic usually don't stress as much because they change the negative to positive. They have patience and don't get irritated so easily or in other words they are unbothered by others. Giving up is never an option especially if it deals with something they love or a dream they have. Since they do not stress as much, don't let others get under their skin, and rarely give up they live healthier and happier.

Careers are a perfect example of the power of good attitude; If a doctor goes into work saying ""I'm not smart enough for this job."" Is it possible that his way of thinking limits the way he works? it may, because he will go on with his day giving 50 percent when he needs to give 100 percent. If he would've change the way he thought maybe to ""if i wasn't smart enough for this job i wouldn't have gone this far."" Now he would be giving 100 percent instead of 50 percent. Since he is giving 100 percent all the time it will make him stand out since he is not just another employee. Employers might just move him up to something more important or give him a raise.

Money is something worked and sweated for, and for those who have to work ten times harder than others generally fix their mentality and attitude. If achieving a goal in life is so hard, then why did most High school drop outs become something great? Not all but the ones who did succeed in life they were determined and had a positive attitude about struggles they encountered. Money is all over the place it just takes the right mind set and attitude to get it. Although money doesn't give you eternal happiness a good attitude will.

Attitude may not fix all of your problems but it sure does give your life a different route. Great minds all have something in common their mind set and attitude. Great attitude takes in life and makes them better. There are many keys in life there is one made for success and that's attitude. Three things that are there once you open the door is a better life style, better opportunities, and more money.  ",4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.5,4.0
AA2191D8D24E,"In the United States the use of technolgy had positive affects on people's lives. If people dont use technology it would be hard to do the stuff people usually do. People can get a job by using technology, shop, and talk to each other no matter where they are. Now days people can't live without technology because it had made their life easier and it is hopefull to everyone who works, who goes to high school and, also if you stay at home. Technology allows people to do many tasks without having contact with others.

Now days to find a job, people do not go to the companies and ask for an application. They use technology to make a resume and just wait on what the companie is going to say. It is easy for people who doesn't have transportaion,

they can get a job by staying at home and use technology. People who works far away from their house need transportation if they want to call the boss they need a cellphone or something that has something to do with technology. when technology didin't exits it was hard for people.

Technology helps people to shop by just using the internet, now days we have a lot of stores that people only can buy stuff by using the internet and it is good because if someone want something they just need to use the phone and go to a store application. Over 98% people around the word use technology to shop. If people shop online they're not going to loose a lot of money because the prices that they have are good. this is really hopefull to a lot of people and to people who play games the internet is a good setting to nuy.

technology helps people to talk to each other no matter where they are, it is know that our planet is big and people lives all around the word, some people don't have the opportuntie to travel to see their family, friends and get to know more about our culture, but now that peole has technology it is easier because you can talk to peole that is on the other side of the world, you can get to know more about our culture just by looking at pictures or videos or you can do stuff without speaking to another person.

technology has helped people a lot in everything day do every day, if people stay one day without technology they are going to see the diference of having technology and not having it. becuase if you go to your job you use it, if you go to school you use it, of course people can live without it but is going to be harder to do the stuff we usually do, that is why people continue making more and more technology to make adiference in our planet and to make people's lives easier.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5
AA416CED237D,"I think some people might find visiting a national park enjoyable because it features better activities and it also attracts more people around the World for example the Grand Canyon or hiking mountains attracts lots of older people from all over the world every single year.

But others might like Community parks because there's not that many people like national parks, kids might find community parks more enjoyable because it provides a wide variety of things like Playgrounds, Soccer fields, Basketball courts, etc and its also free unlike national parks were you have to pay in order to get in.

I think an enjoyable way to spend time outdoors is by playing a sport like soccer, basketball etc, in a community park because you can can play there any time with friends and family it's also free, you can also meet new people in a park or you can also join a sports team like a soccer team and play it with your friends which can also lead to scholarships but in order to get that you must train and work hard then you might get in to teams bigger soccer team's and you might become a Professional player and join big teams like Barcelona, Real Madrid, PSG or other soccer teams, that's what I like to do outdoors and I think other people should stop playing video games, social media, etc and try something new outdoors because it can change your future and life for ever and playing a sport can also help you meet new people travel places, meet soccer stars from all around the world like Spain, France, United Kingdom.

Sports are also good for your health running helps your heart, I also like watching soccer games I support Barcelona a team from Spain the reason why I support that team is because they have really good soccer player like Messi, Luis Suarez and Couthino and they also win trophies like the UEFA Champions League were all the European teams play every year to win the Championship.

also every 4 years there's the World Cup were every Nations soccer team plays to win the World cup.

In soccer if you are good at the sport and join a professional soccer team you can get paid up to more then one million! In conclusion who doesn't want to get paid one million dollars for playing an awesome sport and if youre a girl don't worry because there's also soccer teams for girls and they can also join big soccer teams and make money just like boys and it's also proven that people who play sports are healthier and have better muscles they also eat healthy foods and fruits and run train every day to burn out calories so that they be in shape when they play in their soccer team's and they why i think someone might find that enjoyable.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5
AADAFDCD9944,"Disagree about extending the school days two hour long and be a four day school week, the reason I disagree with this event is beacause if the school extend the day 2 hours can mess up the student schedule after school ends. The students may have to reschdule some of the things that may have to do after schools end and some student can't changed there schdule at all also more stress can happen to the students.

Some student have things to do after school like they have a jobs go to after school ends, I have a friend that has a job he go to after school end and to go right away or he will be late for work that can lead to him fired. I have art school after schools ends and I need to be there on time to finish part of my art work that help me get in to college. Some of the student may have go to an importent event that has a time on it like a funeral in a diffrent state and that can lead to get behind in class work.

More work may over stress the student mind and they might fall behind in things that might be inmported, the student may have less time to sleep to get work done on time beacuse there schdule maybe get more cramp with work to do, then they were before the school have added one more hour of school day. And the classes may have more work to do in class that can lead to more stress to the students and more homework to finish off at home.

Sure when students become an college students and adults they have more thing to do in there schudule then a student in high schools.

AB142AA123BC,"As we all know, students love summer break. but what if they were to take that long summer break we once had and make it into a 3-4 week summer break! I would be beyond upset and I bet other students will too! Personally I don't think it's a good idea. But who am I to judge other people's opinion's. So i'm going to just state some reasons why this not a good idea.

First Reason is that many students want a long break from school. And I mean a LONG break from it. The reason to this is because, we get stressed, tired, drowsy, and even suffer from all the studying and work we do year around. And this can cause depression in teens as well, and trust me I know that feeling it sucks. But anyways back on topic. And for the educators that said we should get longer winter breaks and spring breaks it sounds like a good idea but it just doesn't make sense to me in my opinion.

Second Reason is that students spend more time with family and friends! The reason for this is that students don't have time to spend time with them because the're either doing school work or the're to tired to even talk so they go to sleep early because of how tired they are. And when you are tired you feel grumpy and disturbed by everything so it's better off just going to sleep rather than talking to family and friends because, all your going to bring is negative energy and no one wants that.

Final Reason is that summer break is basically like a reward for students that made it through the year. A nice 3 months without work, stress free, relaxation, and do whatever you want and 3-4 weeks is not enough for us to be honest we need a good long break from it because we just need a little time to relax. And when September arrives it will be a fresh start and are minds will be clear and ready again too do more work. In conclusion these were my statements on why summer break should stay as it is.

ABBE700093F0,"A city council is debating the adoption of a 10 p. m. weekday and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. If the curfew is adopted, teenagers on the streets after those hours would be breaking the law. Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble, or do they unfairly interfere in young people lives?

Curfew helps young kids to stay out of trouble because it can be dangerous. For example, if they just wording around at night they don't know what can happened like they can get kidnap, and be at a place at a wrong time. They can think it's cool but in reality it's not. If a police men stop or pull you over you can get in to trouble because they gonna ask if your parents know you out or if they know where you at and if you said no they gonna call you parents and ask them to come and get you.

Sometimes your parents can get worry if you not home. Kids want to meet up with there friends just to hang out but is it really worth it or to get in trouble knowing your friends ain't gonna have your back. Curfew keep teens from getting in trouble. Although curfew can be good but it shows that your parents can trust you. Night can be really dangerous because you can't see in the dark and you don't know what can be out there. There can be drunk drivers at night also.

Curfew is a law so if you go out late at night you would be breaking the law. Police man really do be canning this serious. All they want is kids to stay safe and be good also to listen to their parents. Teens think that meeting up with there friends at night is cool. But parents just want there kids to behave and listen so they won't get in serious trouble. Why lose your parent trust over some friends that ain't gonna talk to you later in life. Be smart on what side you try to be. Not everything is all about friends you gotta put your parents first then your friends that why them made a curfew.

Plus it the matter of respect for your parents.

Curfew actually helps teens from doing wrong things. Teens don't think that there parents gonna find out but when they get that call saying mom you gonna get nervous or scared because you dont't know what to say for being at late. Parents can be smart at times when they want to but they do be catching here kids in the act of sneaking out ! Teens really do have a choice by picking stay home or go out and have fun. People really care about this law. Who wanna see a kid walking alone without no parent around. Teens just need to sleep or play on there gaming systems . You can hang out with your friends during the day or have a sleep over . Whatever you can do to hang out with your friends but DON'T GO SNEKING OUT TO GO GET FOOD OR TO BE WITH YOUR GRILFRIEND! Just stay at home call up your friends or even your girlfriend so you won't put your self at a higher risk of getting in trouble.

AC692F322516,"I personally disagree using cell phones in classroom, because students will not get the education they need. Students can go on other pages without teachers knowing like looking up something that they are not suppose to. It also can distract others focusing on their work, or studying for a test. It may cause an issue for teachers for allowing students using their cell phones in the classroom. Students using their cell phones can lose focus on the work that is given.

Cell phones can cause problems in the classrooms; while students are doing their own work and can not use a cellular device, while taking a test. Using any cellular device while doing any work or taking a test can get into problems by the teacher and it counts as cheating. Students can also lose their cell phones during class or losing it while going to the restroom. Students can get in trouble by other teachers using it in their classroom, can get in trouble for using it while walking, or hitting someone by accident or making someone fall. Students do not see where they are going to doing around them.

Using cellular devices will not help students learn the materials that is given. Students can get distracted on the work that is given to them and not attend to do it. Students need the education that the teachers has provided for them. So, students need to stay focus on the work and stay on task on the class work, students can genially have their cellular device off ,so is does not keep them from learning. Using cellular device can effects students thinking on a subject in class.

Teachers may not know what students are doing, on their cellular device in the classroom. It can cause problems for students if they are not using their cellular device properly in class. Teachers do not know if students are saying inappropriate comments to others students. Students can also send inappropriate images among other students.

Although, using the cellular device is not the best device for doing work or studying on a subject, that they have to do. Provided the knowledge that is given to students and stay on task when is need that way, it helps you not to get lost, but it also can provide students to learn and not to use their phones. More students lose track on time and whats around them. Using cellular devices can stop you from not doing the job quicker. It can slow the work and lesson that is given to them.

AC8331539332,"""Do we choose our own character traits, or our character formed by influences beyond our control?"" I think you should be you own character because not everyone has good intention in this world, and most people love seeing other people at their lowest just so they can feel good about themselves, or be proud of themselves so that they prove something and they can say that they're more successful than you. That's exactly why you shouldn't trust everybody thats around you. Its okay to communicate or socialize with people every now and then but don't put your 100% trust in them because it's always that one person that you wouldn't expect to betray you and really will. People are good at hiding their true colors. You shouldn't let people influence you in any type of way, be yourself and have confidence in what you want to be in life, after all its you life not theirs. For example, if your parents wants you to be something you dont want to be, don't to it because again its your life not theirs. I understand that that's you parents but live your life and just have faith and trust yourself.

You shouldn't be acting like someone your not, a lot of people act certain ways or try to be someone they're, usually in a relationship because they are scared that the person they're with is not gonna like who they really are, or they might be ashamed because they think that he/she might judge them if they really show who they really are, but honestly why be with that someone if they can't accept who you are? Shouldn't you question yourself, why are you even with that person in the first place, if your even thinking that they ""might"" judge you in any type of way. Sometimes its okay to think though just take a minute out of your day and think and you can actually realize a lot of stuff about people and especially how they're acting towards you. That's why I don't let people influence me in any way because you never know what that person's intentions. be your own person and don't ever be someone your're not, and you should never change for someone just cause they don't like you for who you are, your friends and your family should accept who you are and respect your decision. Sometimes it takes time to see who's really there for you but one day you are gone see who are really there and support you in every step. For example, if your friend don't respect your decision making to something that you wanna do then you should know or question, are they really friends or are they really there for me? because people come and go.

My point in all of this is just be yourself, trust yourself, have confidence what you wanna be and don't let somebody take control in your life or don't get influenced by people that don't have good intentions in you, basically make the right decision. Don't try to be perfect for somebody else's, if you wanna do that then do it don't do it for somebody else, do it cause you wanna do it.

But, I agree that you should be your own character , because you can't trust everybody or expect everybody to have good intentions in you, do something for yourself not cause she/he wants you to do it. Don't try to act or be somebody that you're not, show who you really are and your true color because that's how you really know who is there for you and who is just faking to support you because they want to see you at your lowest. It takes time for other people to open their eyes but when they do they will realize a lot of stuff going on. Be yourself and don't let nobody change you in any way, be unique.",2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0
ACA1A45EE438,"I strongly disagree with extending the school days. Longer school days can have a great impact on students. It also makes class hours long. Most students likes to have short classes. Longer school days can make students, exhausted, have less free time, and hate school. Longer school days will not make students happy.

Longer school days can make students exhausted. Longer school day causes the classes to be longer. Which most students get tired of being in the same class for a long time. Students get tired of doing a lot of work in class which make them want to do less work. Students will be exhausted which will make them not go outside.

By extending school days students will not have free time. Most students like to spend time with their family and friends. However, longer school days can take that privilege away. Longer school days can take away students free time. Most of the year it can get dark outside early, and students won't be able to go outside after they come from school. Since students won't have enough free time to go outside they will hate going to school.

Students will hate going to school when there is longer school days. Because students like to have less class time. Also students would want to do less work. Students wouldn't want to be in their least favorite class for a long time. If the school hours get longer students would not want to come to school. Also some students would skip the classes they didn't like.

By adding hours to the school days students will be, tired, they won't be able to have free time, and they will not want to be at school. Students will hate school if the hours get longer. Students will not enjoy school. Also classes would have a lot of work in one day which would make them not want to come to school. In conclusion there should not be one and a half hour added to school days.

ACABA85B131B,"Dear Manager,

Did u know that many schools do not have local companies and organization that allow students' to explore certain profession?

I believe that they should have local companies and organization because when work as a teacher, the teacher can help students, have fun with students, and solve problems.

When you work as a teacher, the teacher can help you with anything. Like for example: When you are stuck with any of your assignment ,or doing a project, the teacher can help you with any of your assignment, or a project. However, some teachers do not help with students because the students won't get it, or learn anything. When a student needs help, go ask the teacher for help because when u don't ask, then you won't get help by the teacher. And that it is important to ask the teacher for help because when u ask for help, the teacher won't help you because you didn't ask for help.

When you work as a teacher, it needs to be fun because the student can not be bored and that they need to do fun activity like for example: Like going outside and play fun activity playing educational games that contain subjects like Math, Science, Reading, or History ,or like playing Soccer,Football, and Basketball and do more fun so that the students can not be bored. And that it is important to have fun and instead of being bored and not doing anything in school.

When you work as a teacher, the teacher need to solve problems. Because a student might have bad situation, or might have a ruff day. And so the teacher needs to talk to the student who's having a bad day. Like for example: If a student is having a bad day or a bad situation, the student need to ask the teacher to help with this situation or a problem that u have that is going on. And that it is important because the teacher can help you with anything. Teachers are important because they can solve problems that u have or question that you have so you can tell the teacher about it. And that the students need to tell the truth because when your lying, the teacher won't help you and your getting yourself in trouble, and making your situation more harder and more difficult to yourself.

Therefore, working as a teacher is important because the teacher can help students, have fun with the students, and solving situation or a problem. And it is important to work as a teacher, at the same time it is hard to handle with the students. Consequently, a teacher can handle anything, or any problem that you have, or having a ruff day and you need to talk with someone, or a teacher. And that many school don't have local conpanies and organization that allows students to explore certain profession.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0
AD095F1ADE0A,"Students idea to change the school menu would benefit them a lot. This is going to help students a lot,they will focused more at school. I think it is a good idea to change to a new,healthier school lunch menu.

First of all,if students received healthier lunch, its going to help them a lot. For example, it would made students to be on task and be focused in their classes. The will help students to get good grades and to keep students active in all their classes. Changing school lunch menu will have a big impact in students, more people will start to get food and its going to help their brain to think more.

My second reason is students prefer good food than healthier food the taste nasty. In addition, mostly all students would prefer to eat regular food the is healthier. However,it doesn't have nothing to do with your body if you don't want to be fat because of the food you received, thats because you don't care about your body. Students will have to start worrying about their body not about the food they eat.

My last reason is about the benefits of receiving healthier school menu at school. For example, students will enjoy more their lunch. students would choose what to eat and students would have time to interact with theirs friends while they eat their lunch.

In conclusion, i think is a good idea for school to change the lunch menu. Students are going to focused more and students would be on task in school.",3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5
ADF1112226F4,"Do you agree with Albert Einstein when he said ""imagination is more important than knowledge""? I think that is true because if you have now imagination than how are you going to get knowledge. I agree because Albert Einstein had to have a strong imagination to become really smart, Albert Einstein lived through a lot so he knows a lot, Elbert Einstein is smart.

To begin with, I think that Elbert Einstein had a strong imagination because he was one of the smartest human beings to ever live. He was really smart that is why I think he said "" imagination is more important than knowledge"" he had to have a strong imagination to think and become really smart. Elbert Einstein created and invented a lot of thing and to make to things he needed a strong imagination.

In addition, Elbert Einstein was really old and really smart so he lived through a lot as a human not as genus. He also learned a lot from being a genus but he did live through a lot and he was a human.

Also, I think that Elbert Einstein created cool inventions and gadgets from his imagination he needed a wild imagination to think and create a lot of cool things that is most likely why he said this quote. He was smart but he used his imagination too.

In conclusion, I agree with what Elbert Einstein said because he had a strong imagination because he was one of the smartest people, he lived through a lot, he was really smart. I think you should agree too because you can use your imagination to become a genus at you school, job or even your house o with your family. Use your imagination.",3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.0

If your going from failure to failure without loss enthusiasm you will not going to learn from your mistake, Sometimes we need to feel bad about something wrong we did in our life because if we didnt feel bad or sad we will keep doing our mistake and we will not fail in the same things.

Me and My friend we took

IB math together , last year it was so hard for us. one day she talked to me and she says: Generic_Name you will not pass this class because your grade is not good you better change it or you will take it next year .

I went home i felt stressed for one hour a about what she says to me , later i told to my self that she is true about every thing she says meanwhile i didnt t study for the exam and i didnt want to study .

On the exam day i didnt stressed my self I was OK , I ask my friend did you study ? She says i didnt study ,I feel happy because its Friday .We took the exam both of us didnt pass but the thing i felt so bad, When i went home. My dad ask me about my grade , i told him that i didnt pass because it is hard for me .

I remember he got mad at me and i didnt says nothing that time . i remember he told me that is one of my big mistakes that i didn't try or study for the exam also he says that it is nooses nothing is hard if you try your beast , you can do it . he make me feel so bad about my grade, self so called my friend because i thought she will feel bad like me but she was so happy and she didnt care about her grade.

AF6E7702012F,"Is doing your best a problem? Personally I feel like there is no problem by doing your best. You should always want to do your best no matter what your doing. But,some people don't like to try they give up so easily that they don't want to do nothing no more. Like me I try my best but,sometimes I don't apply myself,and when I don't apply myself it turns out to bad results.

For Example,Paul George,and the Clippers played against Los Angeles Lakers,during the middle of the game Paul's shots weren't falling so he was having a low scoring game,but he still tried his best to get rebounds and steals to win the game for his team.

For another Example Generic_Name had a test,and there were some questions on there that he didn't understand. so he still worked through the problems,and took an educated guess and still tried his best and got a 75 on the test. usually Generic_Name get a B or above on tests but he forgot that the teacher told him that there would be some questions on the test that the class didn't know.

Final Example,my little sister is a basketball player like me and every Friday i go to ball handling to get my handles right. My little sister never done it before,and the class that we took was advance,it was easy for me because i been doing it for so long. But,i look to my right and i seen my sister struggling and my Trainer told her she was doing it wrong. So she dropped the ball and walked out the gym. After the training we got home,and i had a talk with her,and i told her i was gonna help her out. I showed her the moves outback and she started to get the hang of it,and now she's been practicing on the moves for weeks,and finally uses them in the game. But, she gave up the first time but, she was willing to try,and the results turned out fine because she tried her best.

You should always want to do your best and not give up because if you do your best the turn out would be great. It makes you want to work hard and do better at the things you want to do or get the things that you like. It makes you feel good because you know you tried to give it your all and wouldn't have to stress about it.",3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0
AF96A2176FB7,"Do you think students should have online classes at home? Do you think this will benefit the students in their life? In this paper, I will argue that students should not get online classes.

Students should not get online classes at home, because some students have to work and they are too busy to take online classes. Some people do not go to school, but they take online classes. some students work at night and they do not have time to take online classes. Students should not take online classes, because schools are for learning and home is for students to have fun, relax, and do what you want to do. Students should not take online classes, because they need to enjoy their free time while they are not in school. I do not want to take online classes, because I work at night and I do not have time to use online classes. My friend takes online classes when he is at home, but online classes took some of his free time.

Some people say, that students should have online classes because they need to focus in school and that they should start planning what they want to do when they are grown up and out of school. They are wrong, because life is not just to focus on what you want to do when you finish school, is to enjoy it and do whatever they want to do in their life. Some people want the best for their kids, but life is one and they should enjoy it.

I think in the future some students will go to school and do online classes in their free time, so they can focus on what they want. Some students will go to school, but they will not do online classes because they want to have a good career, but they do not want an excellent life like the other students.",3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0
AF9F53EC3673,"Everyone has a talent or skill. In my case, Its music. Although my music skills are still improving, I would still consider it a talent or skill.

I've learned to play different instruments such as: the guitar, percussion, xylophone, and the violin, which is what i'm currently playing. At first I joined chorus in 1st grade and finished in 5th grade. I really enjoyed it ,so I chose to learn an instrument, which ended with me joining band. In band, I learned how to play the recorder. I played it from 2nd grade to 3rd grade. After learning the recorder I switch instruments to a xylophone, that played during 4th grade.

Since I didnt really like playing the xylophone, I chose to do percussion for 5th grade. I was also learning the guitar during 4th grade through 5th. when I entered middle school I decided to turn things around by choosing to do orchestra. I learned everything I had to know in 6th grade ,so I was ready to play the violin in 7th grade. I really felt passionate about the violin so I kept playing ,and still am ,and yet will continue until high school.

My music skills can be useful at times, for example: my parents once asked me to play a song for their wedding, they thought it was marvelous. Last year, I sang a song ,that I composed, for my sisters' birthday. She really enjoyed it. I like participating in music contests, concerts, etc. This year I went to New York for a violin concert, it was amazing.

Also, it would be a good opportunitie for them to get done their career at a young age and start making money from what they are apassionated on it farthermore, some young people are interest in work on what they like and this could be a great apportunitie for them to commit to a career and start workin on what they have been apassionated on it and get a job that it would be able to made their families proud of them.

Commit a career at a young age give people the responsability to help their families and support them and with the time people at a young a age get more mature in life ,inorder for people to have a great future in life they should take their own responsabilities and learn from their mistake and with the past of time people learn how important life it's ;while people are gettting more elavate then others peple start to descriminate others who are down don't let people wash your head

Parents have to give support their child with the decision to commit a careeer at a young age, because that's what they want; don't be desagree with them because the only thing that they want is to be independent and lot of mothers don't let their childs be an adult; farthermore, mother's have to impulse their child to make their own decisions and let them learn from their mistakes.

B312F104B015,"I agree that the option the some schools are offering is very beneficial for students, which is the distance learning option. Distance learning is being explained in the prompt it says ""distance learning is an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing"". I think that this option that some schools offer to their students benefits them in many ways. For example the food and transportation are tow big things that some students worry about. This essay will contain the benefits that this option will provide and some of them might apply to you

Some benefits that students will have being in this program are the food and transportation. Let's say that a middle school students always have problems with transportation because their parents work and he have to wait thirty minutes after school everyday, in this case this option that the school offers will be beneficial for him. Another thing is the food. There are some students that do not like food from school some of them bring their own food but some of them opt for not eating anything the whole day. Last year I had a friends that never ate at school because they did not like the food. This option will be beneficial for students like my friends because when you take classes from your own home your are not force to eat something you really do not want.

The benefits that you get does not end there. We all as student had struggle at least once trying to find what cloth to use the next day and if you do not find what you are looking for you might have to go out and wash cloth or use for second time and no body likes that. Well taking this option that the school offers you will not have to worry about that and you can use the same cloth you had when you woke up in the morning. Another thing are the uniforms because not every school let you use the cloth you want. When a school require uniforms you have to use it like or not. By taking the option that the school offers you benefits you in the way because buying a required uniform that you do not want is a waste of money that could have being wasted in cloth that will really going to use. This where tow more benefits that might apply to you.

There still one more benefit and is the liberty to choose whether to do things or not because of the free time you will have by taking this option. Like for example let's say that you are in high school and you like sports but you want to work you will have to choose one of them because school consume a lot of time. In my case I am a senior now and I stopped to play basketball which is my favorite sports to start working because being in school take a lot of time. Taking classes at home take less time than being in school and you could do both things if you want to which are to work, sports or just to do whatever thing you want to do.

Concluding my response regarding to this topic my thoughts are that this option benefits students in many ways.

By taking this option you will not have to worry anymore of transportation, food, or making the things you like the most. Like for example you do not have to decide whether to practice your favorite sport or having a job. As you can see above I talk about some benefits that you should consider by taking this option and that might apply for some students.           ",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0

My first reasons:student should not do there classes from home.

Because it can be hard doing you work at home it batter do the work at work because you can get help by the teacher at home no one can help you. It can be hard to do the work from online because you don't know what the teacher can gave to you i will rather do it at school because it will be easy to do the teacher can help you with it will be hard try to do you classes work online at home.

My seconds reasons:student who are smart should do there classes online at home.

Student who pass the SOL and the class they should get out early from school because people who have a job they should get out early from school. Student should have a high GPA so they can find a collage they want to be they have to think what they want to be when they finish high and collage so they can have there own business person and make money. People who is smart should not go to school because they already pass every they did.

my third reasons:They should make classes work online only for the kids.

Because it will be easy for them to do they classes work online. They should make classes online only for kid it will easy fro them do it it at home batter then school but some parents they want there kid to go to school and do the work at school. If they school do classes online for kid it will be easy for teacher and for the kid.

My finial reason:For school offer classes online at home.

I think all high school student should have classes online at home because it will be easy for student and for the teacher. If student have classes work online at home they can copy from his friends that why is not good to have classes online. Middle school should have a classes work online at home.

Collage should have online classes becuase it will easy for them do complete the classes online at home they will have time to do it and get a batter garde so you can complete the classes and take a new classes when you get A or B.",2.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5
B3AAF502DFFE,"In this generation people use Technology for their needs and wants. If their was no Technology than I would not be able to take my writing SOL which I am taking it right now. In my opinion I believe that the limitation of human contact due to the use of Technology had positive effects on people's lives.

People use Technology to complete many tasks through out their lives. If their was no Technology their would not be any improvement in our lives neither country. people can contact their family with video calls to see their families that they havent seen each other for years. It has been 7 years that I am living in United States of America and I cant go back to my country for various reasons, but I have been in contact with my family everyday, which makes me really happy, and feel good about it. Nowadays everyone need Technology for everything. My friend father is an engineer, and all his work is with computer, and Technology. If their was no Technology he wouldnt be able to complete his task or learn new things neither earn money.

Technology saves Millions of people lives in many ways. Many people do not have money to take tutorials for their kids, but they can use YouTube and Google which let them learn in a better way, and without paying any money. In fact even though if you had money you could save your money and use Technology/ Internet for learning. My parents never took me to any tutorials not because they didnt have money but because they wanted me to be independent and use Internet to learn more. Technology had helped me a lot, and will be helping me and millions of people in this world. I think in this Generation If their was no Technology people would not improve or even learn anything. I have learned from Internet that you can read books online instead of going and buying. Technology has let people gain education and experiences through our lives.

Their are thousands of disabilities in this world which they cant go and work, but they use Internet to sale some stuff so they can earn money. My cousin is a specialist and he was born with not having one of his leg. He was so depressed and didnt have any confident that one day he could work and earn money, but with the help of Internet I have thought him to buy some clothes and other stuff and put it online so people can see and buy it. Technology has lots of benefits that we humans are so lucky of being able of using it which some people cant, because of various reasons. It has been 3 years that we have opened our own clothing business in Unites States of America, and as we all know it's really hard competing with clothing stores here in USA, but from the time we started putting our clothes in websites and becoming popular day by day we are making lots of profits which makes us really happy. Technology has a positive effects in our lives which a lot of people agree with my opinion.

I agree with that, that Technology also had a negative effects in our lives , but also that depends on the person itself which decides how to use Technology. Most of my friends make fake accounts on Instagram and Facebook to bully people which a lot of people die from being bullied. Technology has a lot of advantages and disadvantages that we can use form it. Some people's use Internet for watching bad videos, making fake accounts and put putting fake news on websites and hacking people through social media which are really bad, but their are only 5% that they do those things, and not everyone which we should think of the other 95% of using Technology for their needs, and the benefits of gaining lots of education.

In my perspective I believe that the use of Technology has positive effects on people lives, because we human are earning money out of Technology, learning new things, and gaining experiences in our lives with the help of of Technology. I think their should be a way of blocking the bad websites and making securities for people making fake accounts and for people that bully others to stop it. In my opinion we should think about the benefits of Technology than the negatives because. If their was no Technology our lives would never improve and we would not be able to learn new things. Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contacts with each other. My dad has been in Generic_City for 30 years and his job is sailing Fabrics and all his customers are from Generic_City, Generic_City ,and Generic_City which they have never been in Generic_City. They have founded our sites through online, and buy from us. My dad has never seen most of his customers in real lives they only have been in contact. We should look at Technology from a good point of view.

In General we have variety of reasons that we could use technology of our tasks to be completed. Technology could be good and bad in both ways which we human should decide of how to use it either of our needs or for negative things.

B3F18E671DF2,"Do you think it is good decision to make school longer? When i was in my home country schools was only for six hours i disagree that schools extend two hours a day because the students will lost their focus, teachers will get tired from standing more than two hours, and some of the student will change their high school.

The student will lost their focus for example when i was in Afghanistan our school was from 8 to 12 and we where tired from listening to teachers. However, when i came to united state it was tough for many reason. for instance

When i came to united state it was so hard for me to get up at six and come home at two o clock. In addition if we have school ten hours of school each day the student and the people who work inside the school they all will get tired of school and student will not learn the teachers will get tired of teaching ten hours a day. Teachers will get tired of sanding for example they teach more than two hundred student a day so they will get tired and they teach for tomorrow. Once students get tired they will lost the focus form the teachers and they will start to talking with each other playing around the classroom or they will using their cell phones taxing their friends planning to skip their classes or panning to drop out of schools. The student will not get everything in their mind they will forget it for the next day. Maybe some student come to school and stay at school longer than seven hours a day but maybe some student cant stay longer than seven hours a day because maybe they work after school or maybe doing some think at home for example maybe they take cares of their little brothers or sisters or maybe they clean up the house. Teachers will get so tired because they will talking all day long explaining the chapter and students will not listening to them. Some students will change their schools because they doesnt want to be at schools more than six or seven hours a day. And also those who works in the schools it will be hard for them to clean up the schools the bad rooms or to cook food for students and than after that they have to wash ever think for next students that are coming after A lunch.

In conclusion, imagine you dismiss on the usual time of school. I wish that we dismiss from school on the usual time. I hope all the decision maker wonder how much students get tired and stress.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
B46E31AA2653,"Its important to learn from the experiences of others whether its a good experience or a bad experience.

My mom told me once that it was hard for her to go to school and that was all because she was the women of the house. And she had to do so much work and that was not easy for her every day. Having to cook for many other people and do work for school was really hard even when she would try to do her best it was not easy for her.

Knowledge, Judgment, and Succeed are part of experiences from others as well you might have that in yourself. Knowledge to know and keep in mind that maybe that person you learn something from put so much effort into it or maybe not. Judgment is part of learning to never judge somebody whether its wrong or right.

To succeed from that experience to do better, to learn and to know that from that experience you can succeed and keep in mind what to do good.

Its a good thing to learn from experiences. You might as well relate to their experience that maybe you did not even know you could relate to.

Sharing wisdom with somebody is always a good idea. I think it helps people to improve and succeed and learn from mistakes and learning new and different things.

In other words, sharing your experiences with somebody brings a connection between you and that person.

Sharing your experiences and what you had to go through and knowing the other person know that it was not easy to be successful, there was a lot of work done to put on to be able to succeed.        ",2.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0
B4B8BEB77C2E,"One topic that is frequently debated is about the benefit people receive to take classes online. Some people think that if someone want to keep study they have to go a school to take that class or the classes that they need. They feel that some people do not deserved the chance to take classes from their home. In my opinion i think that taking classes online is a good opportunity for many people because people can work and study at the same time, those classes can be more cheap, and not everybody have the opportunity to attend a college or an university.

First taking classes online is the opportunity that everybody want, but not everybody have. The people that take classes online is getting many advantages. They can work at the same that they are taking classes, they can take the classes during the flight or if they are in another country visiting their family they can take the classes there. They can do a lot of things during taking classes online, and they always have free time to do whatever they want. But the most important you can help your family in home or and your country.

Second online classes can be more cheaper than attending a college everyday all day. All my aunts that graduate from high school are taking classes online and they are close to end taking classes. They said is more cheap and we can save money taking those classes than attending everyday to a college. They save money and now they are capable to pay and attend a college. I personally think that is a good option for me to keep study save money and got o a college.

Finally go to a university in United States is something that not everybody can do. Because you have to speak a perfect English, you have to have good grades, your GPA have to be great, and for people that does not born here and is not a legal and just have tree or 4 years studying is almost impossible. My sister born here she went to Generic_School she was in the ten best GPA and now is in Virginia Tech University one of the best universities and Virginia. I do not think i will go there i just have tree and half years here, i will take classes online during my parents and me save money to pay a college. I am planing to got to NOVA but i will take classes online first.

As you have read classes online have many advantages that we can get if we take it. We can save money, spend time with our family , visit many places and the possibility to go a college. Classes online is the way that you can get your goal, the way that you can feel comfortable taking it at home. But also is the way that you can work and get money. classes online was made for people like us, that are trying to study and be a professional in the future. ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0
B5106AB5C81C,"To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Is not a really good idea, its important to conserve energy, but only in that sense. Because for some students is going to be very boring, and they do not want to going to school, that is why is not a really good idea to change the schedule.

First at all, the students will be really upset, because who want to be at school for ten hours.

Second, its the same if you come five days per week for eight hours, to come four days per week for ten hours.

Third, the business if different than a school, because if a school only open four days per week, are going to be the same if they open five day per week, because the teachers leave one or two hours after the students.

The students will be really upsets, because who not to be, nobody want to be at school for ten hours, many students had a part-time job after school, if the school want to choose that option of four-day for ten hours, so the students who has a job. They are going to lose their jobs because at the new schedule.

It is the same if we come to school five days or four days, its the same time that we spends on school, and then the teachers leave one or two hours later than us. So, is not to much the energy or resources that the school would be conserve if they change the five-days for eight hours to four-days for ten hours.

In conclusion is the same thing if they change the five-days for the four-days of school, because they are going to spend the same time or maybe more than they think, but not is a good idea , for the students who have a part-time job after school. They no want to lose their jobs for that change, and is going to be the same charge if they change the schedule. That is why is not a good really idea for school. ",3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0

I agree with the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for this reasons: Failure in want pursuit your success do you make wrestler in the life, failure in want pursuit your success this one can do you make better in the life, and failure in want pursuit your success do you make more strong in pursuit your success.

The first reason failure in want pursuit your success do you make wrestler in the life I thing that because every day fight for want pursuit you success but many times failure in things but continued fight every day. Also I thing that because if you effort every day you fight for pursuit your success and that do you make a wrestler in the life.

The second reason is failure in want pursuit your success this one can do you make better in the life, I thing that because when you commit one failure this teach you to don't make that failure again. Also I thing that because when you failure that help you to want overcome more every day and make better.

The third reason is failure in want pursuit your success do you make more strong in pursuit your success I thing that because the failure give you knowledge in the life and help to make the correct in the life. Also I thing that because when you failure that help you to overcome.

I agree with the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for all the reasons that can help you to pursuit you success though failure many times but you can overcome all the failures if you don't loss the enthusiasm, all can be more easy when you have enthusiasm and when you want continued forward with you life and pursuit your goals.

B558AFC603D4,"There was a girl named Generic_Name, and she wanted to play violin like she used to. Generic_Name was struggling. It was not easy on getting back to playing it. Generic_Name practiced everyday no matter what. Generic_Name made a lot of mistakes on the way, but successed at the end. When you accomplished something; you have failed before you could have successed. Failing can cause before you succeed because you try to get where you are, you make mistakes, and you can make the wrong choices.

To begin, failing can lead to succes because it happen before you succeed. For an example, you tell yourself that you will get your work done for all of your classes. Then you end up not understanding the work, but tried and turned it in the work. It can also be doing all your chores before you could go out and be with your friends. For another example, you had a lot of chores to do. It was getting late and you have finished all of your chores. At the end you could not go out, but finshed with all of the chores. It can also deal with reading a book. For an example, you want to read a hard book and finsh it, but you end up reading a different level and finshed the book. These examples show that you fail before you can succeed.

Secondly, failure happens before you can accomplish anything because everyone makes mistakes. It can be when someone is trying to make a cake. For an example, you try to combine the inderigdeints, but they were not the right indergridents, Then next time, they put in the right inderigents. It can also be about when someone is trying to practice on their drving skills. For an example, The driver prcatices everyday, but makes many mistakes. Later on, gets better at it. People can aslo make mistkes by giving poeple directions on where to go. For an example, a lady needed help to get the location at the supermarket. The lady asked an old man where it was. The old man gave the direction, but made a mistake where the superamlrket was at. Then the old man told the lady that it was the other way. All of these examples show that mistakes can happen before you can success.

Lastly, failing can cause by just making the wrong choice. Such as a girl wanted to tryout for outdoor track, but she loved playing softball. The girl tried out for track and made the team. There was a problem, she couldn'[t be on the softball team because it was too late. The softball teamwas full. At the end, the girl should of made a better choice. It can also be about how you want to turn out your day. For an example, the boy wanted his day to be fun, but the boy was paying attention in his classes so he was sent to the offfice. This turned out to a bad day. Then he apologized and made his day better. This all shows that making the wrong choices can lead to failing on what you decide.

This all sums up, that failure can cause before you succeed. Others say that failure does not happen when you succeed, however, I say that it does play out before you can success. Failing will always occur when you succeed. You push yourself where you want to be, you make errors, and doing the wrong decision are all reasons why failure can happen before you can success. Do you think there is failure even when you succeed. ",4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0
B68C62AB1515,"Careers are a big part of a person's life. People can choose from thousands of careers that interests them. Careers usually tell a person's personality. A lot of people take careers very seriously and want to know more about careers. Students committing to a career at a young age is a good idea because students will know what a career is really like, they will find something fun to do everyday, and they won't have to worry about it in their adult lives.

Students committing to a career at a young age is a good idea because students will know what a career is really like. Some students lack information about becoming a doctor. Students often don't know what it is like to become a doctor, or know the basics. In order for students to obtain information and knowing how to treat a patient, they need to experience it physically. It is a good idea for students to take action in a career because they will get more information about it. In addition to knowing what is like to become a doctor, students can look up a career they want to know more information about. For example, if a student wants to know more information about dentistry, they can easily research what do you need to do to become a dentist. Students should engage in a career early because they can find a lot of resources to get there.

A second reason students should be in a career early is because they will find something fun to do. Most students don't really do anything after school or in their free time. The students who don't take action in doing anything, will more likely become miserable and bored. For these students the only thing they should do is join in after school program that helps and educates students about careers. Students should be involved in a career at a young age because a lot of students don't know what to do in their free time. Also, students don't really have a hobby they can do. Students sometimes don't really think about having a hobby that can keep them happy. Students can find that hobby by taking part in a career and actually find something that really interests them.

Students need to be in a career at a young age because they will find something that is important to them.

A final reason students should commit to a career early is because they won't have to worry about it in their adult lives. Most teens don't know what they wanna do later on as they become adults. These people usually struggle in finding a job, and also getting that job. If a student spends extra amount of time in school reading and getting information about a career, they won't have that problem later on. In fact they will easily know what they want to do. Students who get into a career at a young age won't have any problems in finding a job later on. In addition to finding a job, students as they get older won't have any stress on what they want to be. When students graduate high school they are pressured in finding a job, which makes them really stressed. Some students aren't as stressed as others because they already know what interests and them and what they wanna be.

If a student who doesnt know at all what they wanna be, they should spend lots of time on researching and attending career based programs to give them an idea or two on what to be. Students should part of a career at a young age because they won't be as stressed.

Some people firmly believe that students should not commit to a career at an early age because they arent well educated about a career. Unfortunately, these students are more likely to have problems later on when finding a job. In order for students to fully know about a job is to take part in a career fair or just overall being in a career so they can be sucessful when doing so. Students should commit in a career early because they will be more educated in a career. In addition to, they will find a hobby in their free time. Finally they won't have any stress or problems later on in finding a job. ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5

B6ADED946A1A,"Hello Ms or Mr teacher,

I'm writing this for convince you to don't work in groups ,and here are my cons and pros about working alone or in groups. The benefits of working with a group, or working alone are complete differents because some people feel more comfortables working alone than working in groups. In my oppinion working alone is much better than working in groups. In some cases your teammates of you group don't participates in the work or they don't want to work in groups. I feel more comfortable working alone for many reasons.

First reason , I can do whatever I want to do in the work or do the work in my way, but in some cases the person who work alone doesn't know how to do the work in this case is good to work in group because maybe your teammates knows the answers of the work.

Second, If I work alone I have more chances to unertand the work by my self without distractions. Because in some cases your teammates of your groups are distract you or other teammates of the group.

Third, working alone can be more benefict than working in groups because you can learn more things about the work, and do it in the way you like the work, without worry about what your group is doing. If we work alone we will have the opportunite of learn more about the work.

I know working in groups are the easy way because maybe your teammates of you groups knows the answers of the work, and you dont have to worry about the work because you know your teammates will do the work for you . But in some cases people who don't participate in the work gets credits in the work what he or she doesn't participates it. And that isn't fair for you or your teammates who did the work.

That's why you should sonsiderate us to do not work in groups anymore.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5

So you don't think that to be mistaken is wrong, but if you make a mistake, try to don't do it again. I give you a example: If you are on a game (football,soccer,basquetball,etc), so if you are on any game and your time is lose, but you know the wron in the other team, so you know that you can attack on this wron and you can won the game, or if you lose that game but you got the revenge, well now you know where is the wrong and maybe your team won the game.

B6F445EE304C,"Dear principle:

I think that changing policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average is a good idea. Students mostly don't try hard unless they're rewarded. If you change this policy maybe students will try on they're best to get a grade B or above. They will see their friends playing all these activities on their hard and best work. So next time they would want to try hard and play those activities.

On the other hand though, not every kid is good at every subject. If kids try their best on the subject and still don't get a grade B average, this wouldn't be fair to them. They would be a lot of students who wouldn't agree with me because of this reason.

Changing school policy isn't a great idea, but to make the students get good grades and to benefit their lives, in that case then it would be good idea. Not every students will agree with me but that's the best way to get them educated even though it wouldn't be fair.

Should people make their own decisions? yes people should make their decisions because important, people will accomplish more faster, and teaching responsibly.

People make decisions important. Everyone wants to feel like they play an important role in the family. By allowing your children to help decide entertainment or snack types, you give them a place in the family where they realize their voice are heard. from something as simple as deicing which good thing to buy they can feel like they are a part of the family more so than will be present they simply want to matter.

When people make their own decision people will accomplish more faster. When you know exactly what you are trying to achieve, you can do it faster period. I doubt that requires more explanation speed comes from greater clarity of purpose and process.

People make decision teaching responsibility. Not all decisions can be met with a successful experience. Perhaps a child picks a movie that is not as good as he or she thought it would be or dessert was disappointing in last. This can help you teach you child to learn from previous experiences. He or she needs learn that not all decisions have a good and positive out come and we learn from this process to make better decisions next time.

Should people make their own decision, it is important for themselves, and important role in the family. People can teaching a child decision have good things and positive.

B7468C4DD17C,"Students wouldn't benefit from attending to classes at home. Schools offer different options that distance learning does not. It's a good opportunity to attend regular classes. Everyone can learn in different ways but a better option it's by attending normal classes. People have the option to choose whith what they feel comfortable. Attending to regular classes gives the opportunity to pick their own classes. We can have many benefits by this. If students attend to regular schools they have the opportunity to meet new people, to participate at clubs and they have the chance to talk and get help from teachers.

Students who attend normal schools have the opportunity to meet new people. Not everyone likes to be anti-social and to be alone without not knowing others. Sometimes is great to have a person that we can tell everything. By going to school, we have the chance to talk to a thousand of people and to make new friends. Once Generic_Name got the options to pick home school or to attend to normal classes. She chose to do classes at home. She was happy for the idea that she has not to wake up early. For the first couple of weeks everything was fine. She was getting use to it. One day she realized that she has no friends; she feels alone. Generic_Name when to talk to her mom about the way she was feeling. Her mom told her that if she weren't pick to stay at home and doing distance learning; she weren't to feel that way. Generic_Name thought about what her mom told her and she decide that the best option was attend to normal classes at school. If we attend to regular classes, we are not going to feel alone and we can make new friends.

Schools provides the chance to participate at clubs. While distance learning don't have activities or clubs for students to do. Public schools have different kind of activities or clubs that they can enjoy. Activities and clubs are a good way to help and to prepare students for the future. They have the option to enjoy a team from their preference. For example, a person who like football. They might like to form part of the football team and that's what normal schools provides. If this person form part of a football team; he can get scholarships to participate in big leagues. From clubs students can get an idea of what career they want to get in the future, to discover new things, and to get experience from this different activities.

Other might argue that distance learning gives students time for their jobs, they can avoid being getting in trouble and they can take care of their youngest siblings while they are at home. However, people by attending to classes have the chance to get help from teachers. It's a reality that not everyone is capable to understand easily. Sometimes we need a push or help from others who knows about the things we don't. The awesome thing about normal schools is that teachers stay a little longer after school to help with hard work. To pay attention during classes can be hard because of other classmates are making noise or it's really hard to understand. Teachers talk about our grades and gives us advices to improve them. Talking to teachers helps to understand because they give us a deeply explanation.

At school people have the chance to make new friends, to have the oppoortunity to try new activities and to improve academically with the help of teachers. Some people can be in disagreement with public schools, but they have on mind that sometimes it can be a better option. School it's a good way to get out of home for at least some hours. Not everyone likes to being at home for the whole day. At school we can have fun with our friends, lunch time is unique and that is something the distance learning don't offer. Activities after school are a good way to keep people out of trouble. To help them to choose a good path. School have a variety of ways to have fun, not just by playing, also by learning.

B794B3C07254,"It is my pleasure to take this great opportunity to express my view or opinion on the above topic; which is positive attitude is the key to success in life?.First and foremost i would like to briefly talk about the term attitude, it can be shorty defined as a good or bad conduct or manner ones shows in public or the kind of act you put up which is either good or bad. If we really take good look at how people live,attitude is the most relevant thing they mostly pay attention to, lets talk about work school.

WORK OR SCHOOL:

If we take good look at this two places, we can see or sort of attitudes aspects, either good or bad that is coming from the students,teachers and many more , showing good attitudes towards others shows how respect you are and what kind of family you came from, most people had a good relationship with others because of their good attitude they have acquire from school or at home,students with good attitude are more easily to associate themselves among others, and become very good friends , teachers really love students who always show a good attitude, sometimes too they can earn some gift from others.

HOME OR CHURCH:

This really take places in our various houses, showing good attitude to your parents or it can anyone ,mostly help to gain favors from people you might not even know they might be your futures helper, because there is a saying nobody knows tomorrow, for instance you went out and some random person ask if you can help him or her to find a place but your attitude did not let him even to ask you anymore ,but imagine some few years later came and you met such same person that ask for your assitance but your attitude was not good at all, maybe he is a manager at your dream job you have prayed to work there, so as soon as you get there you saw he is the one who is going to interview you do you think he will be willing to gave you such opportunity even though you qualified the answer is no he will find any means to let you not get that job , your bad attitude ruin up your whole life, this goes to church too,having positive attitude at church draws human being more closer to God and attract more blessings from him as well.

POSITIVE ATTITUDE AMONG INDIVIDUALS;

Last but not the least is the kind of attitude we gave among ourselves ,this has become a daily rampant that need to failure to get help from other people, imagine you had like 4 close friends but they are be asking for your help on something but some of them attitude is very pathetic , but insisted they really need your help and what you have on you can only help few of them, so would you go ahead and help those who had a negative attitude the answer may be no,because you going to help those of your friends whose had a good attitude first before you assist them too , this really tell us having positive attitude can really gave you so many opportunities or advantages.

THESE ARE SOME MERITS OF POSITIVE ATTITUDE:

1. It creates good interpersonal relationship among individual.

2. It easily to get favor from other people.

3. It always bring peace among others.

4. It really depict the kind of family you came from or the type of trained you have acquired.

THESE ARE SOME VITAL OR MAJOR REASON WHY WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A POSITIVE ATTITUDE;

1. B

ecause it enable individuals to always have a good name in any places they found their selves in and, it also promote economic living,

because you individuals really knows good your attitude is so therefore they will always be proud to share their issues or problems with you without been hesitate.

2. It attract blessings from God , because the bible is even against anyone who does not show a positive attitude among his or her neighbor, and can make your life been successful with the help of blessings you getting from your creator.

HOW POSITIVE

ATTITUDE HELP US IN OUR OWN LIVES;

having positive attitude really help individuals a lot because this earth we live in everything is about attitude even assuming you apply for a job and they monitor you for awhile then later realized you had a bad attitude, do you think the person who is in charge of that work will be willing to hired you the answer is no, because no one can hired someone who has a negative attitude, so imagine now you had positive attitude everything is excellent you even feel proud of yourselves you do not even care wherever you might find yourself in because your attitude is really good and it can gave you so many chances in life that you think you not even to have it, you can also become a remodel to some people , they might even look at you and learn from you , so therefore is very good to have a positive attitude and move free wherever you go , some people really pay attention to people attitudes even more than everything in this word.

CONCLUSION;

Due to time factor i would like to bring my above oppinous to an end and i am pretty sure it may be taking into consideraton and publish it for other people to have access to read and if they had to made some changes in their lives they can surely do so to it.

The reason why i believe it can be bad for their learning enviorment. Since all the work will be the same the students can look things up online. Getting all the answers from the internet and being able to just cheat off friends. Students copying from friends causes students to learn less. Causes them not being envolved in the assignment. The students would be able to pick their own type of questions in the project. Those questions can be really easy for them and picj it for the less work.

For example since the students will be not learning very much during the summer. They will not be ready for the beggining of the school year. Students will find the school work difficult for them since all they did during the summer was choose easy assignments for th project and cheat off of each other. Putting in type of effort to the student-designed project.

Teacher-designed projects will be outstanding for the students. It would so get the students for envoled. The teacher can possibly let the students have partners and it'll be more exciting for them. The teacher-designed project will have work thats equal to your grade. Not make it too easy but also not too hard. Each student or group would have different kind of project so students can have their own work.

Yes student-designed projects would be cooler for the students to have their own project and not be assigned one. It can also help them learn more as much as not help them learn more because students who actually do their own work and choose good questions for the project can help them be successful. But there is just too many students who would cheat and not give effort to the project. In conclusion i think teacher-designed projects for the summer is far more successful for the students than letting them do their own designs, because of the lack of effort is going to be put in if they do student-designed project and the amount of similar project they'll be from cheating off of each other.

Also, i think that it would be a better reason for the student's because a lot of student's want to participate in sports or other activities. So, then they could focus more in school and, get good average's.

Most of the students prefer online classes because they can't get transportation from home to class. Video conferencing and online classes would benfit students in a way that their will be less distraction and work in your own level. Society now in days has many bullies in school that it comes to the point that studuents don't want to come to school and prefer taking class at home by there self.

For example I had a cousin that took online class at home because he had no transportation to get to school. He was able to benefit better at home because even when he was sick he would still be able to accomplish his work. Most of the teenagers want to go to school but they can't because they have no way to get to school. Online classes and Video conferencing is way were students can get education and graduate without leaving their house. My cousin got education and he graduated and he only took online classes and it helped him a lot due to not having tansportation to school.

There are many kids out in the world thet get bullied in school and they want a education but they can't due to bullys. Classes at home can benefit kids getting bullied in many ways for example,

you won't have to worry about getting bullied at home if you take classes at home, you will get less distraction, and you will work in your own level taking classes at home.

Therefore, This is why I agree that students can benefit better taking classes at home in many ways. Online classes and video conferencing may benfit some people but due to experience with family members and friends

I feel like it benfits most of teens in the world. Not all teens get to have education due to many reasons which is why I feel like it can benefit many teens in taking classes at home. ",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5

If you make a bad impression the first time with probably that person It is going to think that you are like that forever. There is no way you can change what others think even when you have not talk to them,people think what they want to think and it is hard to change their thoughts. You can do a couple of thinks to make them trust you and change their perspective about you: like be kind,ask them about what they like,etc. Start a conversation that makes them feel they can talk with you about whatever they want,however sometimes things like that do not work and simply you just can not change what other people thinks that is why you should try to make a good impression the time you talk with a new person that is the reason why first impressions are important.

In my opinion working in group should be more benefits.

Teacher should let student work in group.

Teacher should be allow students to work in group. There are three reason why should they let student work in group:

Working in group think more stronger and faster. Each of every students can catch a mistake. It would benefits to get more information about what topic they will do it.

Firstly, you can look more than one idea. Secondly, each students can make one question about what they are doing. Thirdly, if you work in group you can be more comfortable with your work.

Your working should have the best idea and should not be any mistake because before to give the work to the teacher every students should look at it.

It would be more interesting to meet another students and know what they can do it, and if you can help in something that they don't it. Also, in some schooler teacher let student to work in group because some students don't feel comfortable to do the work by themselves. Some activities should be necessary to do in group.

For example, when they are doing a project. However, most of the classses have workshit to do in group.

For example, make experiment in a lab, present in front of the class.

Some students say that work in group is more funny than being alone.

Sometimes, teacher don't like to put student in group becasue they observe that when student are in group they just talk about anothers thnig not about what they tell you , but not all the students like that.

In conclusion,

for these reasons is more benefits to work and group than work alone.

BA0D3D6A8A94,"I disagree with this plan. I say this because the amount of hours we come to school everyday is enough. If the school board add another hour and a half to the school day all students will be tired, and the students would not be able to learn everything during the day. Being in school for a long period of time and getting homework would put a lot of pressure on the students. For most students the amount of time we come to school at the moment is already putting a lot of pressure. If the school board add another hour and a half most of the students will surely dislike school and maybe even drop out or show no interest in school work or homework. Students would also have a very short amount of time to study for tests or the big projects that they have to finish outside of school at home because some students have a part time job.

Students need some free time for their happiness and physical health. As a middle school student I can say that I get to have free time and do my school work just fine at the moment but with getting one hour and a half added to my school schedule I don't know if I would still have the time to have fun and do my school work and still manage time to spend with my family and friends. It would effect my health if I don't get enough free time to play with my friends or do the things I like. For those students who have a part time job won't be able to spend enough time with their family or friends or get some time to rest. It would surely effect their mental health, physical health and happiness because they are not going to get enough time to work out or do something fun to rest their mind.

Teachers with part time job would have a difficult time on teaching students their best and having a part time job. Mostly all teachers have a part time job because they have a big family and their income from teaching is not enough or they want to save money. All of them have their personal reasons for it. But teachers can not have a good part time job if the school board add another hour and a half to the school day Because teachers must stay after school at least once or twice a week to help the students that needs help or want to take a retake on a test. Teachers will not have enough time for a good part time job or to really take good care of their kids for the ones that are married. The ones that are not married to just take good care of their mom and dad. So teachers would either have to quit teaching or get their salaries increased. So they wouldn't need a part time job to earn more money and they would have time to take good care of their family.

Drivers already are taking a risk for driving in the morning when it's dark. It's very difficult for them to drive a school bus that's full of students when they can't really see the road. Adding one hour and a half is the last thing that the bus drivers need on their plate even if the school board adds one hour and a half to school day it's okay for the bus drivers. But what's not okay is the after school program. After school program is for two hours and with adding one hour and a half to the school day that's three hours and thirty minutes later than the normal time. It would be really dark. So it would be really hard for bus drivers to drive and it would be too risky. It would be dangerous for the bus drivers and all the students that is going to be in it.

After school is a program that helps every student make up missing work, retake a test or redo their homework to bring up your grades. It also help the school finish their work quick when students stay to help for their serves hours. But sadly the schools might have to shut down after school program if they add a hour and a half to school day because it would be hard for teachers, bus drivers and students. Students wouldn't stay after school because by the time the school finishes all the students would be really tired.",4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0

BA5DC45B0E3F,"Our character develop sometimes by our own choices, and other times it develops by the influences in life, we can choose what kind of a person we want to be either good or bad, some choose to be both you can't really pick a side and stay at it , there's good in every bad and there's bad in every good. Some choose to be bad because they think if they choose to be a good person people will take advantage of them since good people always the ones who cares so much , help others all the time , and think about people happiness before theirs. They're wrong in my opinion because being a good person is better than being bad who are most likely the selfish ones that don't care about anyone except themselves. But in my opinion having a character isn't just about being a good or a bad person , it's about having a good personality , loving yourself and loving people , making others happy , having a positive energy , but also most importantly not forgetting about yourself. No one can really have a perfect character everyone got a dark side in them but only show it when needed , like if they were hurting or something bad happened to them or any other life reasons, that's if you choose your own character and choose to be good or bad. Sometimes you really can't choose your own character because the influences of life will choose it for you nothing will be in your control , it all depends on the life you were born in , like your culture , religion , and the people around you , but that's not all sometimes the way life goes is the reason your character change you can choose to be something and life's decisions will choose something else for you , life can be like a puzzle it never lets anyone stay as they are , they always change , grow up , be mature , or things that happens with them in life will make them grow up even if they're young or still not an adult yet. For me I think age isn't the thing but a number , the thing that make you mature is your character and the way you think , if life didn't force you to have a specific character then choose your own character and make it different don't try to copy someone else and be life them , just be you , be different it's more beautiful.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
BAD99FB704BB,"Is honesty always the best policy?

An old proverb says honesty is the best policy. sometimes, however, honesty might get really bad effects.

honesty is a good characteristic , if the the situation is very serious or you and yours friends did something really bad , you need to be honest and speak the true, but sometimes honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someone's feelings or you and people around you might get in little troubles.

Honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someone's feelings. For example ,one of Generic_Name's friends tells her something and ask Generic_Name to keep it a secret,

the next day someone is trying to persuade her to say her friend's secret out loud and she just reply by saying, "" what secret are you talking about? , my friend didn't tell me a secret or something like that."" she did the right thing by laying because if she would not lied about it ,

the friend that asked her to keep the secret would feel upset and nobody else is going to trust Generic_Name. Another example is that if your friend ask you if she looks good in a certain outfit , however, that is not your style and you don't like it at all , the best thing to do is to say that you like the outfit, if you tell her this , you will not hurt your friend's feelings.

One more reason of why honesty is not always the best policy is that you or people around you might get in trouble. For example , If you and your sister ate something that your mom left in the fridge while saying "" I am going to work and when I come back , I will eat this."" when your mom arrives home, you tell her that you and your sister didn't heard when she say that she will eat it later on. This way , you and your sister will not get in trouble , however , you know that it was just a white lie and that if you do something serious the next time , you need to be honest and tell her the true.

In conclusion , honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someone's feelings or you and people around you might get in trouble, however, there are many situations in where you need to be honest and speak the true.    ",3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,2.5,3.0

BB240E6FF61F,"Since the early societies with important philosophers such as Aristotle and Confucius, the world have been in a complex debate arguing about the best way to influence other people. As result, several ideas about how to influence people emerged, such as an internal agreement through the creation of the early constitution in Athens by Aristotle. Early constitution which tried to combat the earliest authoritarian ways to influence people through force. However, those ways to influence people were not effective because those factors dictate the people's actions and created a hostile environment. Therefore, the best way to influence others is by our own behavior setting a good example because this generates stability, creates higher standards, and effectiveness.

Henceforth, setting a good example generates stability because this do not create a patron of dictatorship that generate differences and hostilities between the relationship follower-influencer. As result, this factor create an ideal and healthier relationship, which is reflected in the quality of the relationship environment. As a consequence, the stability created it by our own behavior and example make our message easier to be transmit it and receive it. For example, the relationship parent-son. This particular and common relationship completely reflected the influence of a good example and how the parent behavior dictate the stability in the family, especially in his relationship with the son. As result, if the parent set a good example and behavior the son would be more open to receive the parent's influence. Therefore, a high grade of empathy would be developed. As result, there would not be any differences and hostilities that can damage the stability of the relationship.

However, many people still argue that there are different ways to influence others rather than setting a good example, such as internal agreements (e. i., constitution and other behavior codes). However, those ways still fall into the dictatorship and authoritarian scheme that make people disagree and create conflict. In addition, those rudimentary and forcing methods do not help the persons and the influencer-follower environment. In contrast, deteriorate and break any possibility of improvement because this authoritarian limit you, instead develop you. Therefore, by showing a good behavior and setting a good example the influencing process change drastically because this process became more active, inclusive, and dynamic. As result, this influencing way create higher standards because this method of influencing people promote values such as integration and solidarity that reach improvement and cooperation. As result, the higher standards break the authoritarian barrier and open the path for cooperation, participation, and admiration in the follower-influencer relationship.

Therefore, a great example led by a good behavior becomes more effective because there is a dynamic cooperation between followers and influencers that boosted their performance and empathy in the relationship. Hence this dynamic cooperation becomes stronger, as result the relationship reach incredible stages of solidarity, which is translated into a better and healthier way to influence people. In contrast, the old ""fashioned"" authoritarian ways to influence people just deteriorate the follower-influencer relationship by dictating and forcing the followers' actions. As result, the net influence, effectiveness, and impact by the authoritarian ways become lower than setting a good example and behavior. For example, the actions by the Mohammad Gandhi in India with his pacific civilian disobedience movement; where he led an incredible number of people just by example and a good behavior through the diverse hostilities. This show the huge impact of setting a good example and the effectiveness that this way have on influencing people. Therefore, setting a good example is the best way to influence others because this way is the less damaging and authoritarian, and more inclusive and beneficial method to achieve a greater result. In addition, because this method promotes solidarity and unity, instead of division and competition. Lastly, because this method highlight humanity instead of cruelty.     ",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.5
BD0CEEC9B429,"People should seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters for many reasons, there are some emotions following our own decisions whether is right or not, people shouldn't always follow their heart and do something it could cost your life in the future. Another suggestion is asking for help to those who knows how to guide and gives ideas to people following their own decisions . Having some different types of ideas from different people or culture it can help us to work and do better in life because life's important matters. It can help our sociatity do better for our new childrens and the anyone whos around in our environment.

First of all, some particular people sometimes shouldnt always follow their heart or emotions whether is right or wrong we can always seek for help and do what we like to do in our daily life. For example, the other day I made the worst decision because I didn't have the courage to share my thoughts with anyone in my family or friend about quitting my job or not. I felt like if I suggested to ask someone to help me clear my mind I was going to do better now. Next, later on I saw my manager and told me they had a better job position for me with better health insurance plan. In this case I feel that seeking for guidance is not always a bad idea, is the opposite we can help each other. I made a bad decision for not comunicating with others about my problem whether to stay or leave, what i did it was left the job.

Secondly, in many cases we think we know a lot, but in reallity is that other people can help us to do and give new ideas in our life. Than, If I want to change something in my life I have to love myself more and have the courage to comunicate with others and let them know what I am thinking and expect a better results. On the other hand, making your own decision can also help you to be succesful about life and not depend on others. For example, someone whos expert, can let me know and give me some advices about a proyect because they alredy know it or went through and have lots of experiences in that area. I always believe imformation is important if we working as a team is the best for the human we get to know each other time and values. Although, everything works best when we seek for a true guidance.

To conclude, in many cases people are really succesful because they met or know someone from different culture and shares different types of ideas. In this world we live in many times this is the best way to work with as a team by seeking help from experience people and open up our brain more to understand the problem and to move on forward in our life.

BEC3906A1122,"Do you think that teenagers should be home by 10 p. m. or not? In this computer, I will argue that teenagers should have a curfew and be home by 10 p. m. to keep them safe and away from trouble. The streets will do you know good, so if teenagers get curfew that will be keep them away from the streets and be home safe with their family and friends. I can relate to this prompt, because I'm a teenager and I know how it feels like not having a curfew to save you from getting in to trouble that's why I will argue that it's important to have a curfew.

I think that if teenagers have curfews it will keep them away from trouble like I have already said. Not having a curfew is like you sending your kids to go die or giving them away to the streets and telling them they can do whatever they want and they will not get in trouble. Curfew will help a lot if the government make it a law that teenagers should be home by 10 p. m. if they are home their will be no getting hurt or being in trouble will the law or your parents. I'm a teenagers myself and I would love to keep a curfew that will keep me away from trouble and other bad creams that will get me in trouble will the law or keep me away from my family. No one loves getting in trouble,but if they are out last will other people they call friends that will get them in more trouble, because not all friends are friends when it comes to the streets; or going to jail. I know for sure that if we teenagers have a curfew their will be know one dying, getting hurt, or getting in trouble with the law which means going to jail not all the time, but their are lots of teenagers who go to jail just, because they don't have curfews. I know I'm a child and I don't know much about the law, but I rather get a curfew than go to jail or get in trouble with the law and my family just for staying out last at night.

Teenagers will be safe if they have curfews they will not be in streets or get their parents worried about where they are or what they're doing. Safety is the number one thing in the United States and any other country. The curfew will help them, because if they said 10 p. m. they have to be inside than they're inside, because no one can get to them where they're a safe place like there homes. They will be safe they will not get in to fights with people they don't know all, because of they were out side all night. They're too young to be outside last at night they need to sleep; because I know some teenagers go out on schools and that can ready affect them, because if you don't get enjoy sleep at night you will not be able to do your work in class and when you are sleeping you will miss out on what the teacher is talking about and when it comes to test you fail it all, because you didn't go sleep and stay outside with your friends all night. Teenagers need to be where they're safe, so that nothing will happened to them and their parents will not worry, because there are lots of creams out there you don't want your kids to be outside at night with all the crazy that's going on out there it's scary and I know no parents wants to see there kids get hurt, because they didn't have a curfew and they don't know when to come home. Curfew is there to help and keep us safe and the government need to make that law I really know that if they have curfew time hours how country will be a better place and no one will feel scared to go outside or stay there for long.

Curfew will make you have a better future it might sound crazy, but if we have curfews now as teenagers in the future when we get a job it will be easy for us, because we are already use to getting home quick, so that will not be a problem for us at work. The curfew will be a big help to us in the future like I said going to work early will not be a problem, because no office want a person that comes to work last. So, giving us a curfew at this age will help us a lot in the future.

Some people say that having a curfew is a bad and interfere in young people's lives, but they're wrong, because it keeps them away from trouble, safe, and they will have a better future if we have the curfew.

That's why in the future I would love to see the government make a law about that to keep us safe and keep us away from trouble, so i would give an arm to see that the government make that law I don't know how, but i know that ""God"" will make that happened in the future.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5

First, people with open minds for example a teacher may see a student as a troublemaker but after the students second impression the teacher sees that the student after all isn't a troublemaker but a respectful student. An employer with a open mind may see an employee's first impression as someone who may not be worthy for the job but as the employee processes throughout the job his employer sees' that the employee after all is worthy for the job. Some may say that first impressions are impossible to change but that is not true first impressions can be changed by open minded people who are willing to give the second chance to change their impression,

Second, people who give second chances to others so they can show second impressions for example a father giving their daughters friend a second chance to show their impression again of not being a bad influence to their daughter.

Sports is what most of people do play a sport but we always get frustrated when the opposite team scores a point so we try our hardest to score back the point. School is what a lot of humans struggle on its our work sheets and test but every question wrong we get it makes our brain smarter so do our best and not pick the wrong answer. Family is people we love and hang out with all the time but not very often we get into problems but every time we have a problem we just have to find a solution to do our best. This is why I agree what Duke Ellington said about a problem is a chance to do your best.

Sports is fun activity we can all do but most of the people do or watch but a lot of the player or fans. Start to become angry because their opponent scored a point but. The players can solve the problem and do their best to try to get the point back. When I was ten years old i played on a soccer league my team was losing to our rivals our coach told us the problem why they keep scoring on us. The team and I fixed the problem an tried our best trying to win back again and we did win. My brother plays basketball he used to be terrible at playing basketball he missed every shot but fixed the problem by practing more and tried his best. Most of the sports have a problem but they fix it.

Family are people we love and hang out with but sometimes we have problems with each other. When problems happen we try to fix our way and try our best to not have problems anymore. When I was younger I never wanted to share with my siblings. But i had to fix the problem and try my best to share with my siblings. My older brother dislike me to use his video game so my parents help fix his problem with me and my brother sharing.

This is the essay about how Duke Ellington saying help a lot of people to fix their problem. All of my problems were fixed so it my help people fix their problems to fix them.

I think is true that our selfs choose to make it be because one main reason is because nobody force us to do something we dont want to do we our selfs choose to do it or not do it, its all in our hands in making a decision and also in a decision we decide our personally in weather being a good person or being a bad person and also have to take in count if we are going to accept our consequences from our own decision of what we have choose to be and also how is going to show in our character as our personally around people and your family.

Do we choose our own character traits, or is our character form by influences beyond our control?

We choose our own character traits but we could be influences by other people and it our decision in weather doing what the rest of the people are doing and being influences by them we should take a position on the issue and to be influence but by our own selfs and not pretending who we are really not just because the rest of the people are doing it, it doesn't mean that we have to do it to it our choose and decision in weather doing it or not, we should be influences by our own form and beyond of our own control and letting nobody controlling us let live our own life.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5

I think working in group it is fun becuase each person in the group would l help. That why I prefer working in group than alone because the desventage of working alone is I can not get help from anyone. Also I can not finish it early it would take long.

Second, for example If I work in group we would descuss first and then be an a agreement. Then start working each person in group would have to answer and with different answer. If any one in the group does not know the answer the group would help him or her. It is easy and fast to finish any class work if it is in group. Working in group it is fun because each person learn from another idea of the other person.

Third, working by yourself it is kinda hard. Some people prefer working by themself because they think it better. Working alone is more stressful. That why people should work in group. It help and it is more better and less use of their mind.

Fourth, for example if I do a classwork by myself and it is hard. It would take me more time to do the researchs in google. Also I would finish it late. That why I prefer working in group than alone.

fifth, finally I would like to recomend to each students to work in group unless they are smart enough to do it by themself. However some students or people like to wotk alone if they smart then probably they would finish it on time. Teacher should be agree with me.

Technology helps people with transportation, people can travel around the country from place to place. People use transportation when they have to work.

Another way is make a new sport or activities more fun they can enjoyed and let the stress out of their head , because if many student alwaysdoinge something they can be grow in their life but they can't enjoy the time when they were young because always they just stay focus on doing something that's will be great but not all the time.

If they do inactivity is the same thing because they focus give their time always and sometimes they just left the family and they can't share all the moments with the family.

C2343290CC89,"Conserving your energy it's an important matter. But you may be wondering why? well, by conserving your energy you will be well rested, healthier and more importantly active, so you can last on your long day of work or in my case school, so I can focus on my learning in order to graduate on time.

Recently, some business companies started to conserve their body energy by working less days, but having long shifts a day. 10 hours a day to be more specific. I personally think that, this is not exactly the right way to conserve your energy and keep your body healthier. On the other hand, I would agree that you would earn more money an have better opportunities in your career despite your personal life.

As far as I understand business companies like Management, Grocery stores, or car dealers have a 8 hour shift Including

Schools and government jobs etc...

If people would work 4 days a week and 10 hours a day It would totally not be good for their healthy and personal life.

First of all, If you work 10 hours a day and 4 days a week you would not have enough time to rest. As a result you would definitely be tired, exhausted and having a bad mood for not getting enough sleep. Second of all, when It comes to your personal life there would not be a family time, and no time to go out with friends therefore, I conclude that the concept of having a 10 hour shift a day would definitely not be that best way to live your life.

In terms of education, specifically talking about schools. Since I'm a student I would not be exited about attending to class for 10 hours a day. Basically because I have responsibilities outside. For example, I have to go to work, study for school and attend to my soccer training during the weekends. Also I would not be able to go work by the time school ends during weekdays and I'm sure there are students like me who have responsibilities to care of outside of school.

Now If I have to attend school for 10 hours a day and 4 days a week I can definitely say that my learning would get affected instead of improving. Nevertheless, I would not able to memorize everything I'm learning in class, because there would be a lot more topics to go over. As a human being my brain and body needs to rest, so I can keep all the information I have learned in class.

In conclusion, whether about going to school or work for 10 hours a day would not be beneficial for your professional and personal life for many reasons. For example, It could affect your health and your emotions which could lead you to be stressed out or having a bad mood not to mention that It could also affect your personal life by not having the necessary time to take care of your responsibilities outside of work.

This is a great way to show to the community that you care. Students should know that community service is very important. Community service helps you and your community.

There are many reasons why students should perform community service. Performing community service helps your community and other communities. Your community will be cleaner and fresh. Not just students but everyone in this country should have community service. When your community is full with trash. No one will care, but you can make a change. You will need a helping hand to help you with community service.

It is not just picking up trash. There are planting trees, etc. So, when you are done picking up the trash, you could continue planting trees and flowers. To make it stand out.

C3F3118898B5,"My sister decided to be a doctor at a young age and started to focus on that path. Now, she is a doctor. Choosing which path should be taken in an early age and preparing for it beforehand, will help a lot for the future. Although some people might argue students should commit to a career later in their life, students should commit to a career at a young age because it helps them to decide for their future early, it makes them focus on a specific goal, and they won't feel more pressured to choose a career later in their life.

To begin critics say that choosing their occupation later in their life is more beneficial because they will be open to more new options later than in a young age. To support this idea, a child decided to be an engineer when s/he was young, but suddenly s/he changed his mind and decided to be a surgeon. Should s/he choose what s/he wants to be now or should s/he choose what s/he wanted to be when s/he was young? However, it is obvious that choosing a career later in their life will only make them feel burdensome and their life will only be more intricating.

A more valid argument is that choosing a path to be taken at a young age will let you have a better life in the future. For example, a girl started to prepare for the career she had chosen when she was young and started to work hard for that. Finally, her hard work paid off and acheived what she wanted to be. This evidence is valid because preparing for the career in a young will let your life go smoothly, will give more free time in the future, and won't feel pressurized.

Although people might say that students committing towards your career and choosing it at a young age will lead you to a better life because it makes them to focus on a certain goal of their life, will make them decide what they want for the future, and won't feel pressurized to choose their career. People should consider deciding their path in a young age for their own benefit and betterment. ",4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5
C40BB9E0BC6C,"Should success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.

l agree with what Churchill's about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. Failure is to do or perform. l agree because some people think that if you are failure it mean you can not be success, you will be success no matter what. Some people preform good in ever where they go and do what will make they there success so this is important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success without loss of enthusiasm.

First reasons, ln the world people will say that failure don't make they life by success so if they did something and they fail that all, they will never try it again because they did not get good thing from the fist one. Be strong in everything you are doing failure will not be without loss of enthusiasm. For example My brother wife have an exam to write in the morning so she was learning all the night she did not asleep so l went to her room and tell her to sleep some time before morning and she said no l have to learn so that l can pass me exam and l said OK then am going to sleep. ln the morning she get up and she went to write the exam. The next day they call her and told her that she fail her exam so all what she was thinking was that she will pass the exam but she will failure so she was thinking that she will be success in this exam but she did not loss of enthusiasm.

Also, Most of the people give up if they fail in thing they are doing they believe in them self that what they are doing will be successful for they but the end thing will miss up for them and the loss of enthusiasm the good ideas of bring success tell your that l can do this and do it all. For example, l was write am SOL exam last year and l don't know what to write and l don't understand what the question is say so l was thinking about the question but l don't know what to write so l tell my self that no matter what the question is l will do it and pass it. When the score came because l believe in my self l pass the exam. So you can be success in every thing you do if you made up your Maine in what you are doing. Make your self a good discuss and you will be fine.

However, Some people start their own business but they first tell them self my business will be successful and yes they will be because they believe first before they start the business. Yes the work will be good without loss of enthusiasm. For example, My friend dad has a big shop in Generic_City one night when her dad was asleep some bad people came to the shop to take all his money and the thing in the shop so in the morning people was cry infant of the shop so we all went there l see what is going there so when we went there it was so sad they bad people took everything in the shop not even a pen but do know something he did not give up because he did not give up he fail but he was successful in what he was doing. The reasons why am telling all this is that never tell your self that l will be failure on matter what you will be success.

Other might say that it is bad ideas to be success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. However you can loss enthusiasm any time but if you never give up in what you are doing people do things that they don't believe in what they. One of my teacher in my school called Generic_Name gave as a test and the test was as difficult for as to do so he told him self how can the student do this work so try not to give the test to as the student in the classroom told him that we will can do the test so the teacher the told as that do you believer that you can do it and we said yes we can so he gave as the test to do. infant all the student that told that test pass successfully and the teacher was so happy. So you will be success without loss of enthusiasm.

ln contusion, We have many things in the world that will make you a failure or success, make a discuss to yourself that you will success in life no matter how how things will go. My friends always told me that never give up in life, school and any thing you do. Maybe you have an exam today and when you went home yesterday you did not learn and you was watch TV and you want to pass the exam no matter what you will be failure in the exam. ls important to be success in life if you can be success you have to do what will make you success. l believe in my self that being a success is a good idea.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5
C444D6A0AC1C,"Although, many people believe that extracurricular activities can enrich students educational experiences, and some even become involved in so many activities that they have little time to study and complete their homework assignments. This decision should solve with their families, because this decision shouldn't made by school, school should help not control students to do the extracurricular for their good experiment with other student or get involved with different team works, and some student don't want to do or stay after school program or any other extracurricular activities.

First, whether student wants to join or do extracurricular activities they should ask parents or families first, because some parents don't wants to do the extracurricular activities. Example, some students have a lot of homework, project, tests or their different school works. Some parents don't want let the kids or students to do the extracurricular activities because of their other school works. This can cause their student fail the school or other stuff can happened to them. This is why extracurricular activities decision should made by families not by schools.

Then, school should help not control students to do the extracurricular for their good experiment with other students or get involved with team works. Some school wants students to do join clubs, sports, and any other after school program, because some after school program needs students to do join their program by forcefully. Example some sports coach ask to do join their team but the student don't want to join for some kind of reason, and sometime they email or call to their parents to let them join our programs. Some student don't want to join any after school program for some reason. This is why after school program or extracurricular activities should made by families decision.

Lastly, some student don't want to stay after school program or any other activities. Some student are already tired from school example, some students is already taking lot of extra classes at school and they probably have lot of test and quiz or even homework. If they decided to do after school program or any other extracurricular activities then it's up to their families choice, but most of students don't want to stay after school because they already have lots of homework, projects, prepare for their quiz and tests. If school wants to control student to get involve with any other after school activities then it can cause students grades, lack of sleep, and other stuff can happen to students. This is why extracurricular activities decision should made by their families or by parents.

This is why I want parents or families to make a decision about after school programs. This is the three reason that I want families make a decision about after school programs not by school. Although many people believe that school should control student involvement in extracurricular activities. For me I disagree that school should not make a decision for students, decision should made by students families or by their parents for my three reasons. ",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5

Also many peoples said that the success not consist in be enthusiasm because they said manytimes the peoples that are enthusiasm like for example, when they will stard a business or differents type of jobs they loss money for example or also they always fail in everything and the reason is because they are very enthusiasm for this rasson they said that be enthusiasm not always is good and also not a;ways consist in the success.

I could visit wonderful places like seeing great nature, going into a big forest, and go see big hills. this would be amazing to see wonderful things.

I can be myself in a world when it is constantly trying to make me something seeing things like a place to see nature. Sometimes in some places to see nature is amazing. Seeing nature like seeing different kinds flowers, and seeing and beautiful. I will also went to see the blossom trees. Those would be interesting for me to see those kinds of Nature.

I would think about in a world and it would constantly make me something else when seeing nature a big forest. Going into the forest usually it is just trees, but when I see something new in the forest, it would be very interesting. I would see in the forest that the life is changing. Also I would see fresh fruit growing from the trees. And also I would see a beautiful area with flower bushes.

Sometimes I think in a world that makes me something else wants me to see everything. This can maybe explain that I am on top of a mountain or a hill. Hills would be better for me because I just only want to see a high view of the land, with the mountains it is too cold and windy. When I see big hills usually it is just grass. Going up to the top of a big hill and When I see that this land is clear, this may explain that there's only a plain grass area with trees, this is similar to the past a long time ago.

It is good for me to be who I am, and being myself in a world. This may explain almost everything.

fist, think about benifist that is very important part for students and for the employees , however consider how this model is going to help students and employees from school. Then how this model is going to help the school if they dont conserve energy and resourse. For instance, teachers are affected in how they give students work when they need some proyect to do how they use energy if they dont have resources. Now left think about if school dont have resourses how students use the restroom if dont have water, students also use water to get a shower went they have a game in the school, another think is that women in the kitchen they need water for cook and give students lounch. However, some students work after school and teachers needs to take care their childres after school or some teachers live very far. Beside, they could affect school education. Lastly, school are affected for many manner this affect whith the hours being to a four day school week in the other hand,

let meask abouth disadvantages.

Second, students,teachers and employes are affected in the disadvantages. For example, some students work after school if students wants to stay after school maybe they lost their jobs because they dont present to his work or if they have some homework to do after school they can no stay because they need to work studens are affected. Beside, teachers are affected too because after school they need to take care they childrens or maybe some teachers live very far and spend many time for arive to his home. In the other hand, school employes lost his work because if school work only four day at week the drive lost some hours of job this affect some employes and their families. Thats why this dissadvantages affect studens work and students education because some students dont came to the school if they are resposable with his job. However in my case this affect me because i work after school and i need came to the school too but i need some money. They are many reasons why this disadvantages affect students and employees. Let me ask some benefist that is good.

Finally should fallow this model by stending four day school week you should have some benefist. For example, you should have one day off to stay at home with family, do the homeworks that the teaches give you or spedn more time to study, teachers can relax one day or maybe they prepare students assignment.

In conclution, to conserve energy and resource to considering the benefits and disadvantages to a four day school week, many pleople are affected mostly students and teachers because two hours would affect students job, also the teachers because some teaches live so far from the school and they dont have time to past with his family. In the other hand, the good thing is that they should have one day off and they can relax, students can do their homewors and they can study for his test or maybe they can go to his job in the day off. But is important can to the school every day because we need to learn more every day and in the future can take a better job we can do a good people and a good example for our family.

C656A870B2B7,"Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early?. In many schools districts offer programs that allow students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. This program make students to take classes that can help them to graduate on time, and many student take courses during the summers or in the evening. This is a bad idea making students to finish high school in three years. Because when students are try to graduate in three years, students may not be able to take elective course and student are no joy they last year of high school.

First, when students are try to graduate in three years, students may not be able to take elective course. For example, many students are interesting in elective courses, but they not got enough time to taking elective courses because they are take the basic courses for they can graduate on time. When students just take the basic courses they are not make progress in which courses they are interesting. In conclusion, students need four years in high school for they can take courses where they are interesting and they can start to grow up in that courses.

Secondly, student are not joy in they last year of high school. For example, school where are make student to graduate in three years, in they last year student have to take courses and SOL for they can graduate on time, if they dont past students most retake, and this make students frustrate. This program is making students to rush. But if they fail any classes that make students add more classes to they last year and all this make student to no joy they last year in high school. In conclusion, Last year for students don't have to be the worse year.

In other hand, there are people say, student just need three year in high school, for student can enter college or the work one year early. They argument, that student with three year are ready to graduate and enter college or the work, because many student may finish with their courses and SOL in their third year and the last year they don't do nothing. This argument is incorrect because in the four year students are doing what they need to finish and they planing where they wants to go if college or work. For example, students want to graduate on time, and they need to catch up or retake anything they can do it in the last year. In conclusion, student need a four year of high school for they can get anything what they have to be done.

In conclusion, put this program in school is a bad idea because make students to finish high school in three years. Because when students are try to graduate in three years, students may not be able to take elective course and student are no joy they last year of high school. Because when students just take the basic courses they are not make progress in which courses they are interesting and student are not joy in they last year of high school. In conclusion, make high schools just three year to students is not enough time for students to be ready and plan their future.",3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5
C65AD37C8194,"Desagree,To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplisment

To be yourself in this world is kind of difficult, but if you try really hard you will success with honor,respect,humble and make you strong. Not trying after you lose make people weakness, fearful and incapable.

If you want to success in life and future, just help others when they need it, and be humble with those people who do not have anything in life and they have to sleep in the street. Nobody is more than others, God make us equal. Be yourself every where you go, you do not have to change your personality because other people do not likes you. You have to prove yourself that you can do it, no matter how many time you fell down, just stand up clean yourself and continue. You will found a lot of obstacle in life and all you have to do is play like you are on the soccer field.

You have to be strong and prepare for what's coming in life and do not worry if others tell you that you are useless, just show it to them that you can do it. Sometimes people just left and give up. Not trying after you lose make you weakness person. Weakness person are those who give up in the first try, they are incapable to fight for what they want in life, and don't let no one change your personality, if they really love you,they would love you like the way you are. My mom always told me,""do not give up till you are in the top"",after all the struggles you will be a better person.

Nobody can change yourself, you are the only one who can dicide what you really want to be in life. You make your own rules, but you have to respect others, I will give you a counsel, If people treat you worthless do not treat them like the way they treats you,be original and treat them like royalty, after that, they will see that who lose gold was them,not you. Do not let no one hurt you because we are in a world where no one wants to see any body get victory. All I can say is be yourself, if you want to dye your hair blue and you are afraid what people opinions are, just do it, do not start walk around to find your happiness because your happiness are inside. I hate it when people said like what happen if I do not looks pretty, you are pretty inside and outside, do not make yourself miserable.

The struggles will make you strong and get all you want in life, like David and Goliath, ""the little boy who fight with the giant warrior and he won, when he throw the rock into his eyes"", no matter how big is the problem and how small you are, you have to fight with your fear. If you pray to God and tell him what is going on in your life, he will helps you to solve it, like he solve David's battle. Do not let people change the way you are, because some people just come and goes through and we have to enjoy what we got while we have it and do all the things that we haven't, and thanks God because we are here.

Conclusion,

Live the life you love and love the life you live, just do what makes you happy. Remember that your happiness are inside, all you have to do is look for it and find something that you can prove yourself , that you made it without help and make yourself feel proud and do not let people take advantage of your insecurity because you are great, you are strong and that is all you have to do, focused on your success.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0
C662BDD50395,"Have you ever made a really bad mistake and think you can never come back from it? You can always come back from a mistake. Duke Elligton the famous jazz legend always said ""a problem is a chance to do your best because you learn from your mistakes.

If you mess up and make a mistake you will learn not to do it again. It's better if you make mistakes insted of being perfect because you can't learn and better yourself. We all make mistakes once in a while that's why we learn from them. You shouldn't let your mistakes hold you down. You should let your mistakes better you. Don't try to be perfect. If you do you will just end up never learning from an experince. When you make a mistake, adapt to how you can fix it and don't make that same mistake. This is one of the reasons why a problem is a chance for you to do better. Another reason is You learn not to make the same mistake twice.

You make a mistake and you learn from it. It's fine if you make another mistake just don't makr the same mistake again. If you make the same mistake twice you could get in trouble. When you make a mistake and learn from it you grow. Don't take a mistake as a flaw. You become wiser from a mistake. You become a better and smarter person. This is why a problem is a chance for you to do better.

The last reason is you improve yourself. You let yourself learn more instead of feeling like you can't come back after that mistake. Your mistakes become positive because you learn so much. Mistakes were never meant to be flaws. They werer always meant to be learnd from. Mistakes help you become a better person by learning from them. Mistakes were made by succsesful people and they became famous basketball players, Singers, Football players, etc. Remeber that mistakes are to be learned from.",3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5
C71E90669DFA,"Almost everyone in the world had a big problem in their life. Problem is not rare this days. However, if you think of it problems is not that bad as you think. Like what Duke Ellington said "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best"", and I agree on what he said. I have several reasons why I agree on Duke's statement. My reasons are that problem make us work/push harder, it creates/set our goals, and importantly it make you learn from your mistakes.

Problems make us work/push harder. Many buisnessman have many problems. But they work hard and hard because problems make us work harder. Like what the movie(Your My Boss) said ""A Good Buisness-man Need Problems To Do Better"". Problems make us to push harder. Its like we are the turtle in the race where the turtle and bunny/fox race. I compare it like that because the bunny/fox is like the problem we want to face it and end it.

My other reason is that problems create/set our goals. When a person have a problem of course their going to create/set a goal to complete. Like what happened to me when I was a kid. I never seen my brother since I was 3 years old. So, I created a goal that I want to see my brother again,and it did happen. Problems make us create goal to achieve. My brother and me are a great example of that. Problems are pushing to set a goal that we will create the opposite of problems. Problems set as goals that we would not do the same mistakes again.

Last but not the least, problems make us learn from our mistakes. Because before problems mistakes comes first. When I got a problem I always ask my self ""What did I do wrong?"". Then, when I know what's the reason I just dont do it again so no problems will be created. When you learned your mistakes and don't create another problem their where it proves that ""Problems make us learn from our mistakes"". Brain and feelings are created so we can't make the same mistakes as before. So we can prevent many similar problems in our life.

My reasons why I agree are that problem make us work/push harder, it creates/set our goals, and importantly it make you learn from your mistakes. All of these reasons are very important to know. So you can understand why problems are not bad as you think of. Problems make us push harder, create goals, and the most important part it make us learn from our mistakes. Problems are the reasons why the world is still together and not fighting. Problems make us go together and help each other. Humans are created to enjoy life and learn from problems to problems.",2.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0

Robbing people, fighting, breaking curfew, breaking into peoples cars. I was going through it because I was tired of people bullying me, I was tired of people emberrassing me infront of other kids.

By the time I tried to get a job,all they woud do was look at me head to toe and say they arent looking for employees right now even though their was a help wanted sign out front.

Should people make their own decisions, or shoud they seek guidance from experts and authorties.

If you take decisions, you can have a good life for you'r future. For Exmaple if you want go to the College but you talk with your self and said no go to the college because you not are Intelligent, so you try to deisions go to the college or not go.

you can take your own decisions,For Example: if you take one decisions are bad or no the people need to repect you'r decisions because is you'r decisions,So They not want to know why you take that decisions in my opinion the people only want the bad for you.

You can take more control about you'r decisions,For Example: you can have more control about you'r decisionsFor Example:you can have more control about you'r decisions if you control you'r decisions you can take good decisions and that is good for take decisions

So, you need to have contro about decisions.

you can have you'r own decisions is good to take you'r decisions because you have more capacity to take other decisions, So in my opinion is good to have a decisions because can help to you in the Future but if you take something good for you'r life or for decisions.

CB71E5F9AE1E,"Do you think failure is a good thing or bad thing? Well, what a British prime minster ones said""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Some people may think this is bad thinking because of how hard you try,but you have no success at the end. Yes,i agree with the statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because of these three reasons,failure makes me better than i was at first,never giving up without motivation ,and be able to over come that obstacle that i work so hard for. My first reason, of why failure is a good thing because it makes every body better at what they started with. For example, when i first started learning how to ride a long board i was very afraid that i would fall and hurt myself. At first i really terrible and failed over and over again. Until one day my friend came over my house and showed him how i would do it. But once again i fell off my long board crazy like. Then my friend started to laugh but in a funny way,so i also stared to laugh too. I ask him why he laugh at me,he told me"" i remember at was like you when i stared to learned long board"". He also told me he was really proud of me not giving up and failing. what i understood of what he was trying to tell me is that failure can make me better from having that kind of enthusiasm in my spirit. related back to my first reason is that not just giving up,but having a motivation every time i do anything to keep going. In order to have that kind of motivation of getting out of bed and doing what you want to accomplish at the end of the day is looking up to someone who helps you get to work or hustle i can say. For example, famous people who did or was successful in life like Bill gates who found the gold rush,Arnold the best body builder of all times,and Stan lee who invited the marvel universe. All these people was in our shoes before they became famous. They can motivate us by what people probably said to them like ""no"" or ""it can not be done"". They did not listen to adorers Sayers would though that never would happen. My final reason of why failure is a good thing is to over come any obstacle that can get in your way. For example, the time when i was fifteen years old i had a problem with one of my classes in school where i had to learn to stay away from people who were not good influence on me. At first they looked like good people,but when i started to notice that they were hiding something from me i was really currouse what was it about. Until one day i was with my best friend in his room just chilling and later on he showed me on his phone what i never though they would do. I was really dissapionted what they were doing beyond my back. So on that day i had to over come my obstacle of not making friends with anybody who looks nice or their appraise. In conclusion i do agree with the British prime mister Winston Churchill quote that says ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". because of these three reasons failure makes every body better,never giving up without motivation,and lastly over coming any obstacle that can be on road to success. something that i always believed in is ""no pain,no gain"".

CBA73A4D5C18,"Do you think individuality create a unique way to be your own of life style? Some say individuality make a specific way to achieve goals being yourself. I'm definitely argue with Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement about individuality because your own style of works,Nobody tell us what to change , freely to choose your way of thinking.

First, your own style of works. For example, my dear sister "" Generic_Name"" yesterday, she got a phone call.

I was with her, when she answered the phone call , it's was the teacher saying if my sister "" Generic_Name "" would come at her college, because she was the only one at her class to got a higher score for doing the project with her own creativity and unique steps at the project without following the steps that her teacher being teaching daily at the whole classroom. The teacher told my sister it's a good way to do something with your own ideas without the fear that would be good or bad its just exploring your ability to making great works being yourself .This explain my sister for being the only one to did the project with her own way got the most higher grade.

Second, Nobody tell us what to change. For example,

my sister "" Generic_Name"", every night, she tell me, how I need to brush my hair correctly, she thinks the hair need a proper care and treatment to brushing the hair . I dont like to do at her way because I feel her way to brush it's more slowly than mine own way to brush my hair, so every night she got mad with me because never use her style to brush the hair. I always said to her, I like to brush my hair at my way and my sister can not tell me to change my way at brushing my beautiful hair. This explain, my sister, don't need to get mad for doing the opposite the she wants to do, I got my style and nobody has to tell me what to change at doing any activity.

Third, Freely to choose your way of thinking. for examples. ""Generic_Name "" my sister told to my mom , if she can participate at the "" project of making a novel "" in her school , so my mom let to her participate. She thinks that would be the winner for being the most iconic novel might be existed in the world, so she starting to writing it down, each content at her novel but she dont need a examples of novel because she got her own style to write down, she say her novel would be a entertainment novel because her way to thinks it's different at the other types of novels, her novel will be a her own creativity and passion to make the novel the next most read novel in the world. This explain,free thinking its discovering a new person.

Individuality, makes us special to achieve it goals. style of works different than anyone else. we don't need to someone to tell us what to change. Being free to choosing thoughts it 's s a perfect way to express it with the real world .some says individuality is to be a selfish behavior for doing the things at ours own ways but Individuality it's just a sense of life to find your own way to work. In the future individuality would be the secret tool to reach different goals.",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,3.0

In life things aren't easily handed to you if you want something bad enough you have to work hard for it if you wanna become a better version of yourself. Most people around the world look up to certain successful people and wish to become just like them with all the money, cars, and fame like the famous rapper "" Nba Youngboy "" which has made himself known through his music rapping about his life and difficult obstacles he's had to go through to make it where he is now.

Growing in life and being successful isn't something that's going to happen over night it takes time and patience. With every task comes a difficult obstacle that'll try to put you down and make you wanna give up and people usually tend to give up easily. The only way you can over come obstacles and move forward is to get up from it and keep trying; Barack Obama one of our best well liked President worked hard for what he believed in and helped illegal immigrants around the country get an opportunity to get job legally. Obama had many difficult task but his passion and what he believed in never made him wanna give up he kept trying over and over again to grow and to help undocumented immigrants voices be heard too.

Immigrants nowadays tend to have it harder than most people; they come from around the world looking for a better life, well paid jobs, and a safe home for their family. The majority of immigrants come with nothing but a couple clothes and shoes and usually no where to stay more than half of immigrants work twice as hard to get food on the table and clothes for their kids and wifes. The mindset of having goals and being passionate about something is a powerful tool, Many immigrants work hard enough to eventually become a U.S citizen which has a lot of obstacles to complete. For immigrants to learn the english language is difficult but after studying and working hard long hours they master it and they tend to grow in the american society, Which shows anyone if you really put your head into it you can accomplish anything.

CBF62E8FFA1B,"In my opinion, I think that true self-esteem comes from achievement and the only reason I think that is because when I achieve something huge say I got a very good grade on my project or got an acceptance letter from my dream college, it would make me feel great about myself and raise my self-esteem. It does not come from praise, when I hear the word praise I think of people praising you and you shouldn't rely on people to bring your self-esteem up. To know that you did a good job by seeing the acheivement it makes a person feel like they can do anything. I see why they say praising can bring self-esteem up, it is because people love to hear from others how well they did or how what they did was so incredible. Words can bring self-esteem up and I know this from experience. However you do not need peoples words to build your self-esteem up it's more a want then a need. Achievement is what you need to build your confidence up in yourself not words, I mean sure it's nice to get a couple compliments here and there but not for satisfaction. To acheive is like to do something outside of your bubble to make you feel like you can do anything, effort needs to be put in to achieve. I think our society now expects that getting praised is like the best thing but those people are the ones who realize that in the end thats not something that build your self-esteem up, sure it'll make them feel good for a little bit, but in my head I thought you don't need to depend on anybody to satisfy you as long as you're doing you and succeeding in life. I hope people come to their senses and realize that they cannot live their lives happy and succesful being praised their whole life they need to praise themselves. I used to be a person who loved getting praised for doing a good job or achieveing something I never praised myself though I wanted to. I realized then the praising is not gonna get me through my teenager years, early twenties and late twenties, I had to learn on my own to know that if I put the effort in something I will achieve. I feel like this whole praising, effort, achievement thing is all like one big repeat, put in effort, praise to boost up your confidence and then in the end achieve it's all linked together but peoples words are not going to satisfy you throughout your academic life it's like asking for attention right there, give yourself all the attention to achieve in life not to fail, I have praised myself so much that I got so many positive thoughts in my head telling myself keep pushing,your almost there,your going to graduate as long as the achievement matches the effort put in to achieve. I've always been that child that wanted to make everybody around me proud especially my parents, I want to show the people that have doubted me my whole life that I can do anything I can achieve it's just all if I put in effort or not.

CBFD5CD8BCD9,"Yes, I believe curfew can keep citizens out of trouble by limiting how long they can stay out of their homes. It can improve the city in the process of making the citizens feel safe.

City council should adopt a curfew for teens. Curfew keep teenager from staying out for too long and helps them catch a midnight rest. It balances the world and helps teens managing the time they work in between their jobs and regular daily activities like a midnight jog. Curfews helps them plan to head home early because we dont know what may happen during the night. I love to have a limit on my time because I may lose track of time and be out for longer than I need to be.

Adding a curfew the city is a good choice keeping the citizens safe while improving the public law for less of a death potential. It wont go well if we dont get a curfew and I will explain why.

If we dont get a curfew things will be problematic. Everyone will be staying up late making noise and traffic comes as often while people will just do crazy things. Its important that the city needs a curfew so it keeps the citizens in check and makes sure that no one is up late who might be doing some illegal activities. Staying up all night is bad cause it doesnt help the brain function for u to gain strength for tomorrow. It makes you fatigued and dysfunctional as well as can make you miss important events in life as u go on restless. It is sad to see the amount of car crashes when people drive even though they didnt get enough sleep compared to drunk driving is another story. You can set a curfew for yourself to be safer and more energized for the next day because the early bird gets the worm.

Having a curfew isnt a bad thing. Its an mandatory rule that will helps u live longer, be healthy and keeps u awake for the next day.

CC11E4C2FE01,"Do you think that we should have a program to help younger students?

I think that some schools should have a program, that pairs with older students. My First reason is sometimes they go to school and dont really understand nothing that the teacher are saying, so this is where the program comes to play. Then by using the program, you connect with a random student that learn the same subject as you. And they can teach you the same thing as what your teacher taught you, but they speak to you slowly so you and the other younger students can understand if they dont understand then how are they going to pass a test or a SOL, so basically its like your getting extra help.

My Second reason is, they help younger and older students is because theyre both learning from each other, but it will be hard to make a program because we will need a lot of stuff, but its worth it because the younger students need to understand what they are doing. I think we should have programs in other schools that pair with older students because, so they can help the younger student learn, and make sure that they understand what they are doing.",3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5

CD7201C66BBC,"Students being able to graduate a year early from high school is excellent choice for any lower clansmen thinking of graduating early in the up coming school year. In the past years lots of high schools have witness a portion of students graduating early due to the students choice in education. Not only does the student have the choice, but gains more responsibility, and thinks about his college future. Every student should have that choice in graduating early since they have every right.

Having the choice to graduate early probably sounds like a pretty good idea, to any lower class men trying to see his options in high school. High school choices are pretty slim but knowing you have that option during your 4 years of high school, means you could take that challenge and overcome the odds from everyone else not taking that choice. A student taking that choice is well aware and willing to take full responsibility on his choices.

Gaining responsibility through out this path, is great for a student to obtain. Obtaining responsibility shows a lot in a character, because having this trait takes you far in life, and shows you don't procrastinate in completing a task. In all Honesty responsibility is a major key in a student looking to graduate early, a reason is because you are getting double the work, taking all core classes, and multiple tests happening throughout the week. Just by having double the education in a single year takes a lot from a student, but having that commitment and responsibility shows, and proves a lot in a hardworking student trying to graduate early.

Working hard and succeeding in graduating early is gonna look good, in a students resume for college. One of the reasons a student could graduate ahead of time, is most likely because they wanna get straight to college. Going to college is probably on every high school students mind right about now, but colleges will automatically notice a change in the students class, and be aware of them graduating ahead of time. Colleges noticing the students activity is a good thing for them, because they notice how the student is ready to take another step in their life, and willing to put a lot of effort in their tuition as well, just by doing this they could take a lot of consideration in allowing the student to attend their college.

Overall graduating early is a great choice for a high school student looking into this option. All students in every school district, should all have that choice for themselves. If the student makes their choice they should take into consideration that they will need to take a lot of responsibility in completing all task through the year for all core classes taken. Lastly to take note that colleges have a good eye for them, and seeing the choices they make and how they are doing through their high school years. ",4.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,4.5,4.5
CD99E2D6DBE9,"Hey dear employees.

I'm writing this letter to tell you about some of my characteristics that are needed for this kind of job. I'm a responsible guy, who likes to be able to help the others if they need help in anything. Also I'm a hard worker because I'm constantly doing work, never stopping to do anything else if I'm not do with my work.

First,I think that I'm a responsible worker, because I never stop doing my work until I'm done with it. A lot of people tells me that I should get this kind of job, because I dont like when people are irresponsible and since I'm a responsible worker the rest of employers will like how I work, then they will start to their work just like I'm doing mine. I'm always on time. I'm always trying to able to do all the work and to help the others if they don't know how to do it. If I want to go out and be with friends, the first thing that I tell them is that I have to finish my work if I have time to go out after work then I will be able to go with them, but if Im not done then I cant go, because the job is the first thing that we all should have in mind, then the second thing are friends, free time, all that kind of stuffs.

Second, I'm a hard worker in any job, because I like to demonstrate that I can do the best and any job at anytime. So if you need that type of employee I think I'm the right person, because I will work very hard to finish the job by one day. I don't like to many works to be doing at the same time, so I try to finish one per day so later on I wont have to come and start to do the same work I was supposed to finish the day before. Like I said I like to work hard, to finish everything by the same day. I like to make other people work hard to, not just me, because if we all work hard we are all going to be successful in this job, I'm not trying to be successful by myself, I like to see more people success in life. A lot of employees dont work hard for the job that they have, if they dont work hard, that makes the company or the rest of workers look bad because he doesn't want to do anything. That's what I'm trying to change in this job. I'm trying to get this job because I know that I can help other people succeed, I can make this work by helping others and by working hard every day.

In conclusion. I think this are good reasons why I would be a good candidate to be hire for this job, I'm here trying to get this job, so I can help the others to be good workers and help the company look better, because we will work hard and be responsible to make the best out of the best.

CDCE16D2C836,"Boom that's the sound of a volcano that just erupted. An enjoybale educational activity for me is a volcano because they are intresting and an excellent science expirement.

The first reason I like volcanoes as an eductaion activity is because they are intresting. I've always wandered what caused a volcano to explode. Now I don't need to because I know now what causes them to erupt so voliently. Valcanoes are very fascinating to watch erupt when you see the magma flowing down. The magma can be so hot it can be like being hit with a ray from the sun. It's very awesome how the volcanoes are fromed and made. But as cool as volcanoes are they can still be pretty dangerous,because they could cause harm and erupt,cause chaos. sometimes volcanoes erupt at random times. Sometimes in villages or islands and in this case people don't have time to run. Because the magma flowing down is like an avalanche because it goes really fast and the people can't outrun the magma because it is to fast. There have been more volcanic eruptions that have killed people even children. Like pompei which was a huge volcanic eruptionthat killed a lot of people. After the eruption paremedics and police went back to discover the remains of people under huge rocks. Volcanoes are very intresting althougj they can be dangerous at times it's amazing how it looks when it erupts. Volcanoes are one of the greates things to study.

Next a volcano would make agreat science project. A volcano is a good science fair project. Because it's very amusing to see how the volcano erupts. When it erupts you can see the hot flowig magma as if people on a raft were going down. Volcanoes are a good science roject because it lets you know more about volcanoes and how thy come to form. Volcanoes are very rare to find here where I live at but there are still some outhere. That's a good science project not only because they explode but because you can even show the layers. Volcanoes have layers the top the middle and the bottom. The top is where the magma shoots out like a bullet from a rail gun. The middle is the less calm part and the bottom is where all the magam is. That is why I think a volcano is a good science project.

In conclusion an enjoyable educational activity is the science project of a volcano and i gave my two reasons why a volcano is a good educational activity. What is en enjoable educational activity for you?",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.0
CDE661A599F5,"Imagine the president and the government of our country being nothing but idle and letting the country run on its own. There would be no regulation in the country. The history would repeat itself and many of the tragic historical events that happened in the past would happen again. We talk about the American Dream a lot but being lazy and just waiting for something to happen will not take us anywhere.

As Thomas Jefferson said, ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"", I agree that if we always do something we accomplish more.

We as human beings have so much potentials in us but we will never discover it through inactive.

Firstly, I believe that inventions and new discoveries have made people more lazy and inactive. I dont blame Inventions and discoveries because they were made with good intentions and not through idle ism but there are people who trust inventions more then they have to. There is always something to do in this world; we accomplish more when we aim higher. Even small chores prepare us for something big. laziness is a big wooden door which can only open by ourselves and once we open that door, theres always something big waiting to happen and once we accomplish that another big adventure awaits.

In the history of United States, there were many people who idolized idle. We had a government who let the country run free, this had a great impact to the country. the country was poor, people died because of huger, disease etc but now the country has accomplished so much then the people in our past would have imagined. The country is well know all over the world now. The country has accomplished by establishing government regulation which removed all the laziness from the country. If a whole country can accomplish so much from not being lazy then imagine what a person can accomplish.

I believe there are people who supports on being idle more that have to do work. I agree that it is okay to not do anytime sometimes because everyone needs a break in their lives. There are people who believe in not having to go outside their house because they have all the technologies or they think they have nothing to do. Technologies serve their own purpose but we have our own purpose, we are born to do something big. If we could just go out and just help one person and day, that person would help another and another to another, this would be such a great accomplishment.

In conclusion, I agree on what Thomas Jefferson said and believe that there is more happiness in doing something everyday then being a idle. I hope everyone see's how much bad impact idle is in our lives.",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0
CE43CDF8BAA4,"Social Media,Technology,and Education. The World around us is a beautiful place , but we do not take notice.

The smart phones play a vital role in today's society , it is the hobby of the century. The schools are now taking the advantage of the new technology , but along with the new use comes new problems.

Although, using the technology in schools becomes a faster way to learn , most schools are relying in the new invention of the century. Nevertheless, distraction in the schools will be a problem, also the students will be less perceptive in class because the students will fail to maintain self control over their devices and the results will be disastrous in their future.

To begin, the students in the school should have all the things they need to learn such as books, they should not rely on the devices to give them certain information. For example, the internet has a wide variety of information which could have a negative or a positive impact on the user , also the information in the web is very inaccurate which could lead to misunderstanding. This shows that the students could gain wrong information and could be getting a misconception in the topic , which could lead to failure in academics and to achieve nothing in their future careers. Clearly, the user have to make a wise decision between using an information in their cell phones that could possibly be wrong, or use a textbook that it is revised by many authorized teachers.

Further more, in today's society there is social media which is use to stay in touch with close family members who are far away. Cell phones are a great tool for anything , it is a mini computer. The students will be using their cell phones in social media to talk to friends instead of focusing on their task. For instance, if the school allowed such action, not only will be making a very poor decision but the school will earn a bad reputation from parents and even to the national level. This proves that it will not only hurt the kids academically but the school itself will have a downfall in popularity. Obviously, the teachers and staff will be unemployed by the county due to the lack of income from the state , teachers but not only students will be damaged by the decision that could be taken.

Overall, having the ability to own a cell phone is a privilege to have not a right , teachers and administrators should take away the device from the student if and only if the student is not cooperating, and return it at the end of the school day or simply not bring it to school. The devices were not made to harm others in many ways that people have tried .Social media plays a role too in the students it is like a temptation in their pockets , they always have to update their status in social media and text their friends and stay off task. In conclusion, Cell phones are a great way to study and do some homework and stay in touch with family members but in school is a learning place where it should stay like that and cell phones should not take that away.

Choosing a career at a young age is bad idea.

Every once in a while people would want to visit an opportunity company because if they help me and I could help them, convince others to participate, and they could help me become more and more successful.

First, they help me and I help them. I'm interested in Landscape Design, I would want to learn more about that work force. Many things about Business Management, improving a business is worth any companies while. In return for them helping me, we could talk about improving the managers company to draw more attention. It's a win-win for both me and them.

Second, I would convince others to participate. When I get the help I want, I could explain to different individuals that there is many work opportunities. For example, if they want to work in Construction or Welding the company can teach them about that work force. Gathering people for a job opportunity could be hard. For example: giving out fliers, business cards, or writing a book and selling it. Only what matters is to convince others to part-take in an opportunity.

Last, the company could help me become more and more successful. In the future when success comes my way, I would start my own company/opportunity work. On the behalf of the first company/opportunity-work, who has helped me be the best in the future. This is a little off hand, but it's for the one who has made me successful. Many other individuals, adults and young teens think its a waist of time or this won't help me in the future. In reality, opportunity work will help you to be successful or famous.

In conclusion,

I would help them back and help their business grow to be the best. I would return the favor of them letting help me. In the future, I would want to grow be or be famous. I feel that opportunity for future working is very important.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5
D06C0F3D5553,"People love doing their favorites things where it will keep them safe and healthy. Activity means when you are doing something like playing sport, going outside, or participating in some type of competitions. There a lot of activities, you can choose and participate in it. My favorite activity is playing with my friends at national parks. The choice, I chose is playing with my friends at national parks because it keeps you healthy and unstressed.

To start, one reason I chose is that playing outside keeps you healthy. For example, I had one friend like some years ago, but now we don't talk because we kind a faded, so we used to play a lot. One time my health was getting bad because I stayed at home all the time and doing nothing then I talked to my parents about my health and they said that I should play outside with my friends, go somewhere special where you haven't been. Then, I went to the parks and played there tag, played hide and seek, and played soccer. I had fun and after some months, my health got better and I just continued playing those 3 games. It's important because nobody really wants their body to have some problems and then they regret, so that's why you should go outside and play with your friends.

In addition, other reason, I chose is that playing outside doesn't give you a stress. For example, in 2016, I had this big stress about school and about homework and what we do in classroom. I just couldn't focus on my studies and got like bad scores on the test. Then I tried to find the way to get out of the stress and it said that you should go outside, do activities with your friends that you like. I asked my mom about this and she said yes to me then I started to go outside with my friends everyday and I was kept forgetting about my school and homework which was good for me. I didn't have any stress after in 2016. it's important to be not stressed because then it affects on your study and also it affects your health, so that's the other reason, you should go out and hang out with your family and friends.

In conclusion, playing outside helps you not stressed out and keeps you very healthy. As a result pf these reasons will help you in your life and honestly these two reasons are actually reliable, you just have to follow them and there you go, your life will be amazing. Playing outside and doing more activities help you a lot and it doesn't give you any bad day or anything like obviously you don't want any and bad situation to be in your life, so follow them.

D129F19FF7F7,"People should make their own decisions to avoid bad guidance from other ""experts"".

Everyone should make their own decisions because they know themselves better, they know what they like and what they want, mentally and physically. For example if someone bought someone else something that they didn't like or didn't want and is the total opposite of what they needed, they wouldn't have sent the other person to go get it in the first place, now would they?

Also, people should make their own decisions so that they could learn from their own mistakes and their misjudgments. For example, people buy the wrong size of clothing online everyday without trying it on in stores first. People will now know to go in stores first or to get themselves measured first before ordering clothes online. Another example, is that people look at something they think is interesting and nice, but won't read the directions or the descriptions that come with it and once the package that they got or ordered it at their homes and in their possession is either not like the picture or is smaller then what they thought it would be or is just one piece of what you ordered. This is a great learning experience for them to not do it again and to always read the descriptions of what you're ordering comes with.

Lastly people should make their own decisions because not all ""experts"" can really help you with your situation or not even do so well on your case. For example, people can pay a lawyer a huge amount of money for them just to fail on your court case. Another example, people pay to see a doctor for something they think is wrong with them because they're hurting badly and doctors will say you're perfectly fine and prescribe you an expensive pain killer, which people can already have at their homes. Last example, a therapist can also prescribe you medication that you don't need but will still give it to you because they can. Some therapist don't believe in that but most do.

So therefore, these so called ""experts"" sometimes don't know what they're doing or sometimes they are trying to make money out of innocent people or even sometimes is it always okay to make some mistakes and learn from them and your misjudgments. So it is always better to make your own decisions to avoid bad guidance from others.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0
D1A682106D3C,"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. Although some people think that a positive attitude will not help a lot help a lot to be successful, actually that is not true. A positive attitude is the key to success because, we can always be out of stress and bad thoughts, we can always have a high confidence about ourselves and for something good to happen, and we can always have a good and friendly personality wich makes others to feel good about helping us and we can use their experiences in our lives.

Here are some reasons that explain why a positive attitude is the key to success. the first reason, is we can always be out of stressand bad thoughts. For example, when we are in the bad situation and we don't know what to do, if we have a negative attitude you will be filled with bad thoughts and anxiety, we can't think properly and find the right solution. The second reason, is we can always have a high confidence about ourselves and for something good to happen. For example, if you are studying for our test, and if you have a high confidence and you are certain that you will pass the test, you will absolutely pass it. And last but not least the third reason, is we can always have a good and friendly peronality which helps others to feel good about helping us. For example, if we have a problem and we don't know how we can choose the right way to slove our problem, when we have a good and friendly peronality it'll makes other people to feel good about helping us, and we can use our experiences in our lives.

We have been talking about the benefits of having a positive attitude and how is helpful for us to slove our problems and have a healthy mind. These reasons such as, first, we are always out of stress and bad thoughts, which makes it difficult to think in the right way. Second, we are always have a high confidnce about ourselves and for something good to happen, which this gives us strength and make it easier for us to solve our problems. And third, we are able to have good and friendly peronality, which makes other people to feel good about helping us, so we can use their experiences, are little details that effects a lot in our lives.

I agree with what the quote which said, ""Unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" because if you stay at the limits that you were already at before you'll never know what other things you can accomplish and we as people have to acknowledge the fact that in one point in life you probably said to yourself

"" I am going to maintain this life."" by saying that your not improving your life.

I agree with what the quote said, ""Unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" if you stay at the limits that you were already at before you'll never know what other things you can accomplish. To begin with, you want to to go beyond standards because maybe you'll learn something new ,or you will encounter an ability that you probably thought you didn't have. For example, when I was in freshmen in high school I decided to start playing and training for soccer and I tried out for the junior varsity soccer team I told myself I am gong to play at my standards, so the coach saw me playing nervous and he asked me "" why are you playing nervous"" I said, "" I am trying to play at my standards"" the coach said, ""Just relax."" after that I found out I had so many abilities to become a great soccer player. In addition, it's not bad at all trying to go beyond your limits because the more you go beyond your limits the more you'll want to keep doing it. Also, there's that one saying "" Go Big Or Go Home"" one of the sayings I live up to. Finally, you always want to think big for the most part of your life. Also you always want to try new things in life that's the only way you'll grow in life.

I agree with what the quote said, ""Unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" we as people have to acknowledge the fact that in one point in life you probably said to yourself

"" I am going to maintain this life."" by saying that, your not improving your life. To begin with, life is short to be honest you and I am still trying to do things to improve my life. For example, I am 17 year old in highschool, I listen to with one song called ""the nights"" by Avici. He talks about his dad telling him you always want to experience new things and try to live life to the fullest, so right there I am just saying to myself don't maintain the same life, try to experience new things in life period. In addition, don't have a simple life try to be creative in this life. Also, you might not be ready to go beyond your limits, but just know that one day you might be willing to give it a try. Finally, there was one time I was scared to go on big roller coasters. I could only go on medium roller coaster because they didn't look scary at all, but there was moment on the day I told myself I getting a big roller coaster so I did and it made feel good about myself because I tried something new.

Also some people may say that, you will grow even though you don't try anything new in your life. In addition, some people probably don't even care about life. Finally, others might have their own opinions about this topic. Also some wouldn't really care about. In conclusion, in the future I will try to improve my limits and think big.                            ",2.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5

For example One day i got in trouble for hitting my neighbors car with a soccer ball, the next day my mom told me to tell the neighbor about his car and i didnt want to tell him because i know that he will get mad at me. so i went and told him that i hit his car with a soccer ball, he was mad at me and i got in trouble. but i was honest to him that i didnt mean to hit his car.

In addition to this prompt i think it might be impossible to change our first impression not because we can't change it, but it'll be because is part of our personalities, in my case should I say is part of how I really am, how my culture distinguish me, that's what makes me unic and by trying to change a part of me it would make me feel empty, because first impression means a lot to me and is all thanks to my past experiences that I've been through.

In conclusion to this paragraph i think that first impression is important, it helps you to understand how a person is, also it helps you to analyze that one person, and most of all i think it helps a lot when you're patient when trying to understand others at the first time, sometimes or most of the time people would judge others by their first impression without seeing what's really their intention, this is what I think about it, we shouldn't judge just by the first time you meet someone even if you think that person is an stranger, just give them a change to prove you're wrong with their actions and their way to treat people, thank you.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0
D2517350CB3A,"Elective classes are chosen by student who are intresting to be part of it. Many students

Probably prefer to have a elective clase because they are learning what they like, and will be less difficult for them to understand the class. In my positon students should be required to take elective classes because they attend to school every day, students are teach in what they want to learn and students are much success in class.

Many students do not attend to school in order to not have a clase that they do not like. Students that use to not attend school is when he/she have a class that is not intresting to learn; they may think that the class is not important enough to help them in a future, and letting students to take elective classes probably will stop the absence of many kids because they will want to know new things about the class . Furthermore if students have an elective class they will have that exicitement to start the class on time and not be late, neither to miss school any day because of their interest of learning .

Students should be guide in what they may think is useful and much helful for them. In some school people had heard that many students are teach In things that may not be needed in life like art, some students take art because they like that clase and problably because In the future they Might be plaining to become an art teacher, but for others is preferable to select an elective class that will manage her/ him to be succsessful. As a result of take an eletive class can be a tool for students to discover what subject is most important for them to have knowledge and have the passion of keep learning.

However other may say that students should be required to take a music, art , drama class because students can have intertainment having these kind of classes, but I stiil be thinking that students should be required to take an elective class because learning what they like, they put much effort to get knowledge and good grades, for example study, pay attention to what the teacher is saying participating in class or any other activity. Moreover obtain good results of what they decide to choose to become a successful student.

Students who take elective classes have the advantage of learn what is interesting for them , and be succsess no just in class also might be helpful for students in a future.

D25F59B6DC95,"Although some people say that first impressions are impossible to change, nevertheless I think that first impressions can sometimes change because you get to know thaht person, how they act, and that can sometimes change what you think about them or they can sometimes not change.

In order to think about something about that person you have to get to know them because if you don't know them you won't know why are they being like that. You can't just think something wrong just cause of how they dress. If you get to know that person you will know what they been through. Sometimes people judge just to judge or to think someting that is not true about them. For example when I first saw my guy friend I thought he was wierd, but when I started to talk to him he was totally diffrent from the guy i thought he would be, he is fun to talk with and hang out with.

Some peoples' first impression about someone they are not good. Some people jugde you in how you act and how they dress. The way people act is how sometimes how they are actually are. But I mean if you talk to that person they might be fun to hang out with 24/7. Talk to that person then you will see how first impressions are not always what you think they are.

D2E545CFEBF3,"I would agree and disagree at the same time because their can be good reason and bad reason of why it good to extend 2 hours of school and working for 10 hours each day. My first reason is that it good extending the 2 hours helps you learn more things and catch up with any work. What is good about Working for 10 hours each day is that you will have money for colloge and save up. What is bad for working 10 hours is that you will be tired and sleepy.

For example if you work four-day week you should work at least for 8 hours only because you need to get enought sleep, leave some time for home work. But it also can be good because you can only work for four-days and rest the week days. Working more than 8 hours you will feel tired,sleepy and frustrated. Therefore it better to work only 8 hours instead of 10 hours because it too much,as a result you can get bad consequence or bad grades.

My other reason is that I think school should not follow this model because working each day 10 hours it too much. However their can be bad consequence of working 10 hours and extendidng

2 hours in school. My first reason is that you can be tired and not listining to the teacher while she teaching. Second reason is that if you extend the hours of school many student will be livid for staying more hours in school.

I think that the school should not extend the hours is because some teachers need to be in places too,needs to rest and also needs more time on grading papers. I also think that many students have part time jobs and also they need to be somewhere. Some students will be tired and sleepy. Another reason I have is that student needs to go home early to go do their homework,rest alittle.    ",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5

D36CCF111F86,"A positive attitude is more helpful to others and motivational,But ones attitude dose not necessarily have to be positive in order to succeed. Ones attitude can be either positive or negative as long as it improves ones ability to succeed. There are many keys to success but attitude is a major key , because attitude introduces or rather shows character. A positive attitude is a great thin but ones attitude can be negative ,but it is more over whelming to others and some might not either like or no longer associate with that person. As long as that attitude helps with your success it should not matter what type of attitude youve got.

Ones attitude is ones guide as it allows more options to come ones way. In a way attitude can guide and help ones path to success or it could close all the doors to ones dreams and success. On the side of a beneficial attitude; people can really catch the feeling of your attitude. What that means is if the attitude is negative but it gets things done then it should not matter as long as it benefits the amount of work or what ever is being or getting done. A positive attitude is more or rather feels more rewarding that much of a negative attitude. A positive attitude is more rewarding and dose allow the people getting that attitude to feel more successful and more appreciated.

Although a positive attitude is more beneficial it can lead into less work or less progess being made and shows that one is not trying hard enough to succeed. By having a negative attitude your showing to others that your work matters. And by doing so you can encourage others or rather inspire others have have a good work ethic by tring your hardeste even if some one is pushing you to work in a negative way. Success come to ones mind and it over comes everything if they put their minds to it.

Yes attitude is a key to success, but it dose not have to be positive if its beneficial to one in their path of success. I do believe that a positive attitude is more appreciated but a negative attitude is less appealing. I feel as long as your attitude is improving your work ethic and it benefits your progress then is should not matter wether or not its positive or negative as long as you have the right mind set you should have a successful work ethic. Your attitude reflect on your work it just depends on how you use your attitude in your work. for example if my boss came in yelling at me saying "" get to work your not getting paid for nothing."" thats a negative attitude so thats going to make me have a negative mind but if i can use that frustration and negativity to inspire e to do my work I will notice that all I have to do is do my work and my bosses attitude will change one me. But if my boss were to have a positive attitude then I could also use that as a motivation as it not only shows me that my boss likes that I do my work but it shows me that im appreciated.

I can see that having a positive attitude is more motivational, but ones attitude can be negative as long as it benefits you and others in a positive way. people need to understand that they can use these attitude to benefit themselves.

I do not, i believe that if you give a student false praise then the student is going to get lazy & stop producing work with the quality and efficiency that they used too.

In truth I was just like this, I once had a teacher who put so much false hope and praise in me that i started to not care as much as i used too, it effected my social life & determination as well as my standards, intent & self-esteem, I was no longer able to spend more than five minutes on work without getting distracted or discouraged, eventually i came to terms with the fact that not all my work was gonna be perfect, but if i spent enough time on it then it would be a hundred times better.

So what is the best way to build self-esteem, well that would be hard work and dedication, lots of people think that just because they do some work they should instantly be rewarded, there work does not even need to be good, for them to think they deserve praise.

The best way to actually build confidence is through achievement's,when you accomplish something and you do it well you get this since of success unlike the half baked work most people get credit for.

Once you actually build up confidence everything in life gets easier, you start doing your home work on time, when a test comes up you would be very well prepared to get an A, your friends and teachers start to respect you more & your parents will be proud of you, but most importantly you will be proud of yourself.

In conclusion having false praise & hope is bad it lowers your standards and makes your work ethic terrible the only good way to build self-esteem is through achieving something out of hard word and dedication.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0

First reason, it allows people to do much more in less time. We can complete many tasks without having contact with others. For example, people can check out books, shop, and learn without having to go no where or speaking to another person. Not only that it saves us time it also saves lives.

Another reason, it helps us and others on emergency situations. For example, we are able to make emergency calls at any given time for help without having to go no where. Also, we can call to report someone or something that will harm us and others. Not only we can call for emergency we can also call people we care about that we cant reach.

Final reason, We are able to talk to people we care about and love that we can't reach. For example, If your parents or someone you care about are in a different state or country, and you want to check in on them you can just call them without having to go or travel to them. This what makes technology a positive effect on our lives because it makes everything easy.

In conclusion, technology has a positive effect on people lives because we can save time, save lives, and contact people we care about. This why technology has a positive effect on our lives. But at the end of the day it all depends on you and how you want to use it you can make it positive or negative to your life.       ",3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0

D45A0B7F9D48,"A topic that is frequently debated is whether students should be required to take a class in the arts,or should it be elective? Because of both students and parents opinions I believe students should not take a class in the arts,besides it should be an elective.

There are several reasons to consider when debating this topic,for example:the class in arts will require a block that could be used for a class the student is interested in taking,or it could be used for a class the student requires to take in order to achieve graduation. As a student interested in having an advanced diploma,I believe art classes will not help anybody to achieve their goal of obtaining the advanced diploma,also if students are capable of choosing their own classes they will gain experience in that field,and be more successful.

Students should be able to make their choice when deciding if they are really interested in the class,if someone else choose the class in arts for them and they didn't like it;they could ruin the experience of other students who are really passionate about arts. Students who are not interested in art could be a problem for the class and even their grades could be affected if they don't participate,or turn in assignments. Moreover,it could lower their GPA and their dream about graduating could be affected.

In addition,art classes will not give them much credit as other classes,will not help grow their GPA,and it might not be as helpful as other classes. As mentioned before:not passing the class will lower their GPA,even passing it will not give them too much credit,and of course school want students to be successful during their journey through high school. The choices they made during school and the classes they took during school will impact when they graduate.

As you have read,giving students the opportunity to choose either they want art classes or to take classes by their own choice could have a big impact in their graduation status. Schools should offer our students classes they are willing to attend,a class they feel will help them succeed in life,and in a way they enjoy their journey through high school. It might see insignificant to debate for something too simple like this,but letting our students take their own choices could help them take better choices for our society. Moreover,if our students are able to graduate and accomplish their goals our society will have more people that could help to assure a better future for our legacy.        ",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5
D464E294DDB4,"Our character traits are formed by influences beyond our control. For example family has a very huge impact on who you become as A person because you are with them every day. Another big impact on our life is the community we grow up in.

We do not get to choose who our family is therefore thats beyond our control. Family can influence you to either be a great person or A horrible person. For example If you grew up watching your father abuse your mother, you have a higher chance of putting your hands on females. How ever if you have kind, loving parents you have a higher chance of becoming a nice, loving person. Keep in mind we are with our family everyday so were most likely going to end up like them.

We can't choose our community either therefore its beyond our control. Personally I feel like the community we grow up in has a huge impact on our life because it determines the kind of people you grow up around. For example if you grow up in a bad neighborhood you will be around gangsters and drug dealers. As a kid you may think selling drugs is fine because you seen other older kids do it. Selling drugs is going to result in you going to jail which means your going to be around other bad people which is most likely going to have an influence on the person you become.

Others may think seeing bad should inspire you to be better but unfortunately it is not that simple. Your character is usually built over the years not over night.

In conclusion the person we become is built by influences beyond our control and we can not just change when we want to.          ",3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0

Some people would fight for this task, that is how much a person love recording data. There might not be author person to fight for it but there is always going to be a person that wants yo do it. Experiments might be enjoyable to some people that like recording data. Some people might be in a math class recording data, but I think a experiment is more affected.

In the other hand, some people like to find out how something works. For example, a person might want to find out how the Faces of Matter changes. Maybe that person already knows, but want to know more about it. Therefore, that person does a experiment to find out more. Some people love to learn different things. other people will spend all their life trying to fine something out. It maybe new or not.

One reason why I'll rather have afterschools program is because it improves your skills more than you could ever had. Afterschool programs are reasons why students have been growing a lot this past years. I had a friend call Generic_Name who had really bad grades, he sign up in a afterschool program and in a few weeks, he already had almost all A's.

Another reason why I like afterschool programs is because is a easier and faster way to do your homework. I'll rather do my homework afterschool because they can help me and I could have more free time at home to do whatever I want. Homework is good to improve your grades specially if they count as a quiz grade, because quiz grades count as thirty percent of your grade! Furthermore, There's one more reason why i'll rather have afterschool programs than having nothing.

Some student's may need time to do homework, go places that take a long time, or just make up time to study. If schools were to add more time the students would not get enough sleep because they stayed up late studying for a quiz, test, or just homework causing the students or the other classmates to sleep during classes

Second, it would affect the mental health of the students. Making them stress out over knowing that they would have to wake up early and be dismissed late.

Third, the education time of some student's may be cut short. This may happen when some student's are in a sport or they just need to leave school early. Student's who participate in a sport may have to leave class early to go practice for an up coming game making them miss half and hour or more of education.

Those who believes success shouldn't be consist of failure have their reason. Some say failure may negatively affects people in their life. But, success makes people feel proud and enthusiasm. Because a failure makes you a loser, not a winner.

Failure helps people to find their a path to success. People fail, but they can learn from their mistakes. For example, I took math test last week, and I didn't do well on the test.

I know many people hate failing, they think it's negatively affects their life. But, failing is sometimes there's benefits because it's positively affects people personality. Such as, hard working, proud, and encourage. First, people have their dreams, some wants to be a football player, or some wants to be a president. They need to work hard to accomplish their dreams.

Actually it shouldn't because students can cheat during a test and they get distracted.

Some say that cell phones shouldn't be allowed in classrooms because students can cheat during a test and they get distracted. For example one day my English teacher told me that she let her students to use their phone during a test to search something about the meaning of the words that they doesn't know. Then, she told me that she told them that they can only use their phones to translated the words that they doesn't know what it means or to translated to their own language. After that she says that she gave to her students the test and she went to seat to her desk, but then she was observing that one of her students was using his phone too frequently, she went to see what the student was searching and she saw that the student was searching for the answers of the questions that the test have. After that, she saw that one of the others students was taking pictures of the exam, she went to see why the student was taking pictures of the exam, she ask him that why he was taking pictures of the exam and he told her that he was sending the answers to his friend who was sitting in the back seat.

Moreover, she told me that the other day that she was explaining the class, some students were using their phone and paying less attention to the class. Also, she says that the students who were using their phones during the class when they got the test they doesn't know what to answer because they were distracted with their phones and they got a lower score in the exam. I believe that cell phones shouldn't be allowed in classroom because is a distraction for students, sometimes there are students that when the teacher is explaining the class they are using their phones and when the teacher gave them a test they got bad score in their test and that can be a problem because their grades can get very lower.

Those who believe that cell phones should be allowed in classrooms have their reasons, they believe that using cell phones in the classroom it can help students to research for a project or it can help to do any other assignment. One example can be my friend Generic_Name, his history teacher always gave him assignments that he have to search in the book about the Civil War or World War II. He told me that it's very complicated for him to search some things about those tittles in the book because the books doesn't have enough details for him to what to put in his assignment or sometimes he doesn't know how to summarize the meaning of the paragraphs that the book have. However, when the teacher let him use his phone he began to search about the tittles that he have to search and he says that it's more easy for him to understand more about those tittles because he is using his phone for a educational purpose. Also, he says that when he plays Kahoot or Quizlet live (

those are learning games that sometimes the teachers use to help students to study

) he learn more than when he read a book. In my point of view I believe that cell phones should be allowed in school because for me sometimes is very complicated to read a book because there are some words that I don't understand, but when I use my phone to search it's more easy because in the phone there are some meanings that I understand .

In summary, some say that cell phones shouldn't be allowed in classroom because students can cheat during a test and they get distracted. However, some believe that cell phone should be allowed in classrooms because it can help students to research for as project and to do any other assignment. In my opinion I believe that cell phones should be allowed in school because it easy for me to search the meaning of a word that I don't know and I feel that I learn more then treading a book.

It is not a good way to enter college nor work without finish the four years of high school.

First, to do only three years of high school is not a good way to start forming yourself for the future, all this is based on the future and what you are going be able to do, for example, if you do not do the four years in high school you will miss more information, that is going to affect you in the future, and sometimes you will not be able to select courses, or in some cases you will have to take these courses on summer, which is not a good idea, because most of the students with ages around sixteen and eighteen hang out a lot, so for the students is harder to focus on their thing as their courses, While the students that are doing four years of high school will have more time to focus on their courser, and they will have the oportunity to learn more.

Second, the student that decided to graduated early are not goint to have the necessary knowlege, as the students that are doing the four years, for example, responsibility is one of the most important things, that you will use in the future, so how can you get it, for example, the homework, projects, and team work that you will have in high school, because doing four years in high school give you responsibility, and new abilities in the proces of learnig, also it develop your brain, and as consequences of learnig, and responsibility you will get new skills that you will be able to use in your work area, or college, while the students that graduated early are not going to be able not have the enough experience to enter a new system.

Last, in my opinion the school that let student graduated one year early are not thinking in the welfare of the students, because they are not just letting the students go ealry, the schools had found a way that the student can rush themself to get out of the school soon, to go to college or work instead of doing the four years in high school, that will help a lot in the future.

Because it is not a good way to enter college nor work without finish the four years of high school, the students will not have the necessary knowlege as a regular high school student; to do only three years of high school is not good way to start forming yourself for the future.

In this essays, I will argue how a healthier lunch menu can improve students diet and make them more secure of themselves. People that eats healthier tend to be more active and optimistic like my family.

My mom has been a great example to my family. ever since, sher started eating healthier we have seen a big change in ther. she gets on time to her job and has more time for me.

Although, my family eats healthier, not everybody keeps their diet. My uncle was the second one that started eating healthier but, it has not shown any results out of his diet because, he eats junk food before he gets home. this behavior has make his more fat and lazy.

Moreover, when my family started eating healthy, we stopted expending in junk food. Eating healthy helped us reduce our expenses by a lot. All the money that we used to spend on junk food has been going to an index fund, that will be used once we finish highschool. It wiil be used to start a company.

Some people think that eating healthier doesn't get you anything but, they are wrong because, healthy food gives more nutrient than junk food. In the world, healthy people have been very successful. In the future, I hope that the school change the lunch menu, so we can have a healthy and active life.     ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

Some peoples opinions can support your choice or can go against your choice. Getting other people's opinion can help someone think of a better choice and make that choice more helpful to that someone.

Why getting other people's opinions can help someone make a better choice or think of a better choice is because, people can tell you the same thing but in a different wording. Having different opinions can make someone think of a better choice because people give that someone ideas of the choice they're going to make. Having more opinions does help a lot because they could make someone's choice more beneficial and help someone's way of thinking about better choices, having less people wouldn't really want to persuade someone to make better choices and it wouldn't be that make someone think of a better choice. The more opinions people give someone, the more likely the choice will be or they will think of a better choice.

Opinions can persuade someone to make a better choice because a good friend or a good person can give his opinion that would make someone want to make a better choice having lots of good opinions can benefit someone's choice and make better choices. Having two or one opinion doesn't persuade someone to make better choices but having five or eight people could make someone want to make better choices because people can be very persuasive and some people wouldn't really listen or care what one or two people say but if its at least five or more then there is chance of that someone might listen or even care because lots of friends and family or even teacher want that someone to make better choices and he or she can't just ignore that unless they want to make bad choices.

D95A9CC4C62B,"One educational activity I would like to do is being in a chorus class. Because I get to practice my singing skills,I can learn from others,and also I can perform in from of people. I can do this by staying after school so i can practice more skills,or ask the teacher or students for help when I need too.

I think practicing your voice skills is very important if you want to enjoy the chorus class because you can get alot out of it. Ones you're out of the basics you can get more advance classes.

Secondly i think learning from others can help you because if you don't know something that other student knows you can ask if they can help you. Also seen what other student might do you can get an example from them or you can do what they are doing for you to get better at it.

Also when it gets to performing in front of alot of people I might get nervous because I'm not use to that I might even forget the lyrics of the song that I'm singing ,but ones you've done alot of performs you are not going to be afraid of going to sing in front of alot of people.

In conclusion, joying a chorus class can be fun because you can be with your friends or you can make new friends,and you can learn your singing skills,you can also learn from others and ask for help when you need too. So I think being in a chorus class can be helpful for you and others.

D96EF27304E5,"Should schools control how many extracurricular activities you take? There should be a certain extent in when schools can control how many out of school activities your in. The students family should be the deciding factor in whether you leave or not. That is if you start to fail classes, your parents ask the school to take you out of some, or if your attendance towards the meetings look bad. Then that is when the school helps decides what happens towards the student.

First of all, I think it should be a certain extent in what you can enroll for but it should always be up to the student and their families since that is a major factor inn deciding what to do. If the family thinks the child has no time to do homework or study for upcoming test then they should talk to the student about the issue and hear what the student has to say. If the family decides on letting the child continue is upon them but if they chose to take their child out of the extracurricular activities the must notify the child's guidance counselor and notify the main person in the activity

However, if the students starts to fail classes or most of your grades keeps dropping the the students guidance counselor should talk to the student and see why. If they see to many extracurricular activities then there should be a talk with the student to see which ones he can drop for the time until the grades are up. This should encourage the student that if they want to be a part of the activities the they have to be able to maintain their grades.

Lastly, if the child's attendance to the meetings are bad and are inconstant they should not be allowed to participate in the extracurricular activities. The child should only miss up to five meetings per month with out any consequences. By making the child leave the club and notifying their parents the reason why then should the child be kicked out. Without furthermore, reasons the child could be suspended from coming to the meetings for a certain amount of time.

In conclusion, the school should have very little say in the decision of a student being apart of a extracurricular activity. More or less said the families have the most say in the deciding factor unless the students grades are dropping or starts to fail some of their classes. Their attendance towards meetings are bad or if they just don't go to any meetings.

For example in my life when I don't have a good morning for example like missing the school bus or having a disaggrement with my parents. I try my best to leave a smile on my face and just have a great and postive day. Another example is when I see it in other people would be just diffrent because people are diffrent and they act diffrent in every way. What I mean by that is that they can be either mad, sad, or annoyed, or just super excited to have a great day. Why I say that they can act diffrent in the morning or afternnoon is because when your going to work your maybe tired and exhasted and stayed up till like 12 AM for an asssignment for your job. Same with school. On the other hand there could be people that are super excited to have such a great day for work or school. Those people are probably really excited because maybe they finished there assingment or homework quickly. Another one is the afternoon people that come back from school or work there. Sometimes there's people that can't wait to go home and eat and see their family and just go to sleep after that.

Some students have a hard time focusing in a noisy environment because other students are disturbing the class whiles they are trying to pay attention.

Students who aren't comfortable in a noisy environment cant express themselves in class,but if you take classes online you get to express yourself for example video confrence you get to express yourself and ask good question with good explanation. Because everybody has a way of learning some students adapt quick and others learn slowly,but taking this one on one course helps you adapt really quick because you are alone in a quite environment which is going to help you adapt really quick! Online classes also helps because some students have a hard time waking up early in the morning to school which causes you to be late everytime,being late can lead you to detention,saturday school and other things. But with this online course you can take it anytime during the day. Mainly my point is online classes are very helpful and it helps students to concentrate more.

Some students would disagree to take classes online because some people have a fast away of adapting. Some students like to interact with others,students like to experience the high school life.

DA26E5E2C08E,"Many people believe that teenagers should have a 10 p. m curfew on the weekdays and during mindnight weekends. In my opinion I say having a 10 p. m curfew on the weekdays for teens that works and get out of work late might not be a good idea. Another example can be, you never know when an emergency can happen at your house and or anywhere else and you have no one to pick you up or an emergency hoccurs at your house and you have no one to take you, at least you got your son/daughter to help you out. Lastly during high school is when you get a lot of projects to take home and when you have test the next day and a project due before that can be a hand full and it can stress them out, by letting them do their work and have more time to study, it improves their grades in school and they do better in their classes.

I have a lot friends that as soon as they get home they get ready to go to work, and most of them come out at 10 p. m but by the time they get home it can a little more passed 10 p. m depending how far their job is from their house. Many teenagers help to support their family in whatever they can, having a job that can help them support your family is truly a good help. Letting your son work passed 10 p. m is not something you want to get in between due to thier boss changing their schedule sometimes and if hes helping you out by giving you money to pay a bill or to go buy food for the house it's worth him/her working a little late. I have friends that work very hard in school and after they home they change, they put on their uniform and they go to work to bring food the house due to his mom not getting payed good enough at her job. Others work to buy themselves their own needs, for exmaple when they have school dances and you need to buy a ticket and your mom has no money, by working you can buy a ticket and attempt to the dance. Another example is prom, prom can be one of the most exiting activities high school has, but it can also be very expensive if you have no money and your trying to look nice and presentable.

You never know when an emergency can occur at your house and you have no one to call or help you out. I once had a friend that his mom was pregnant and he had little sibblings that could not drive but him, and as the pain started to get worst he took her the Hospital and thank god everything turned out fine for them but the reaon they didn't call anyone else for help due to the fact they we're new in the city and didn't knew anybody and it was passed midnight, so his older son carried her to the car and drove her to the Hospital. You never know when an emergency can happen to you or someone in your family at anytime. Another example was when my dad and I drove to Walmart to buy my mom some medicine because she had a bad fever and a headche and we left the house exactly at 10:30 p. m and when we got back home we gave her medicine and the next day she felt a lot better.

During high school is where I have gotten a lot of projects that are hard to make and thier due two days later, not only do I be having projects, I be having homework from all my teachers and test that I need to study. Staying up late to complete your work can most definately help you complete your work or at least do more than what you couldn't had finished if you were to sleep at 10 p. m. Whenever I have a lot in mind like projects, homework, make-up work and test that I need to study really be stressing me a lot until a point where I feel like i'm being rushed and I can't concetrate right if I have other things in mind that I need to get done. But by having no curfew you can go to bed late, but at least you were calmed about it and you werent rushing into getting it done, when you took your time.

Many people can see 10 p. m curfew as something that should be done, but think about the consequences that it can have for example, not being able to work and help your family because can work passed 10 p. m or you never know when something can happen to anybody at anytime and there's noone to help out, or when you need more time to complete your project that you weren't able to finished due to curfew.

Imagination is more important than knowledge because you get to picture or about what you want to do when you grow up or something you want to do with your life or your friends. You can imagine all that by thinking about it or just doing it when you want to.

I remember one time my mom ask what I want to do or to be when i grow up I said a soccer player and I said i imagine me playing with one of the best player playing with me mom said but you have to practice very hard to even make it on the team and I said you going to see on your television very soon. Knowledge is not important than imagination because knowledge you have to learn about it to make sure you no what you talking about but imagination is when you imagine something in your life that you know is going to happen in your life one day is as fun as everything in the world that can make you happy in life or a point of your life.

So ne time i was playing soccer with my friends outside in the rain and I imagined myself making it on the school team I was very happy when I made on the school team. So the next day i went to school and they were calling out the people who made it on the school team, So I head the call my name and I was very happy because they called my name out and it is because I imagined myself making it on the school team and every worked out good, So I was the best soccer player in middle school, now i can not wait when I am famous and ever body know my name.

DA8F8C0D6952,"I believe that students attending school from home will benefit for many different reasons. Students who experience anxiety attacks, depression, bullying, or just not being able to attend school for the day will find great use in online school, they can connect with their classes or teachers without being in school and not have to miss out on important information or work. Students are able to be in a safe environment at home if they do not feel comfortable in school.

Furthermore, students with anxiety or depression may have a harder time going through out the school day then their peers. For example, my girlfriend who has very often panic attacks, dislikes attending her current school. She was a new transfer student to the school and was also new to the school itself. She found it hard to not have anybody to go to and vent during the school day which causes her to stress and have anxiety. Moreover, she gets very often panic attacks during the day which makes her not want to come to school more often. She finds it easier and safer to stay at home. When ever we're on the phone over face time, she's always doing her class work that she takes home to complete. She's a hardworking student and always does her work but because of the environment she's in, it limits her on what she is capable of.

Not only that it would help students feel secure, but for the students who are sick for the day and cannot attend school, wouldn't have to miss out on important information or work. For example; there are days where I just feel weak and tired but I wouldn't want to miss a review day for a major test the next class. If there was online school, I would be able to connect with my teacher and the classes from home where I feel comfortable. Also, my mom wouldn't have to worry that i'm failing my classes because i'm not showing up to them. I believe that other students would agree with me on this argument because almost everyone I know, wishes they could attend school from home.

Moreover, adults might not have knowledge of this, but let me tell you; there is a lot of drama and rumors in every high school. No matter where it is, the policies it has, the advances of the students, there is drama. And drama is one major factor on why students wishes to attend school at home. Just Imagine the advances of our present civilization if there was no drama at school, and no have you heard this or have you heard that. Drama and rumors are big time distractions to daily school work and it peaks the interest of every student. By enabling online school, students dedicated to become scholars are able to take this distraction out of their equation. They can attend school without dealing with the big mouths talking up and down and all around the school.

Overall, distance learning has a very good impact on the students. Students feel safer at home, and when they are sick or cannot attend school for they day, they wouldn't have to miss out on important information or work. Online school would be very beneficial for everyone.",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5

That's why I believe that people should always try to seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters. I understand that some people may like making their own decisions but it's always good to take advice from experts. It's always good to talk to someone in case of an emergency. For example I was sick at home with a lot of pain and I refused to go to the hospital, until I talked to a doctor about how I was feeling and he suggested that I go to the hospital to get checked up and I did and it made me feel a lot better. Sometimes it's good to take an experts advice in a matter like I was in, you don't always have to take their advice but its good to just talk to someone about it and keep in mind what they say for future references. It's always good to follow your own instincts but sometimes it's not. Their are people who have experienced the same thing you might be going through right now and are certified or trained to help. For example my aunt is currently training to be a consular for high school kids and her goal is to gain the trust of her students so they can come to her when they need help. She always tells me that she was a high school kid at a point and she knows what its like and the problems kids might be going through, so that's why shes training to help them in making the right decisions. When I need help making a life decision about something like college I go to my consular who's been in college and knows what could be right for me, I always take in mind what they advice me and make a decision. It doesn't always necessarily need to be help for an adult it can always be help from a sibling or other family member who has been through what you have and who you know will lead you in the right direction.

Usually 12th grad, they don't have any P.E class, they need to have some sports to make sure they are more health. Or you can just stay at home for study if you think school time is not enough for you, help your family do some work at home, like clean house or make some food for your family.

However people should have some change and progress for our life time , and make it become more and more good, perfect. Don's always keep the old way for your life, try some thing new. It will be fun. There are lot of first time you try already some not, for examples first time eat fish or some food that you never try before, first time go swimming or some sports that you never try before, life only have one time, and it's short , fast , don't make your life without color and fun. It will be boring, nobody want have that kind of life.

It's good for the teacher too, they are most tired people in the school, when they teaching, they can not sit there ,they need walk around and make sure you understand that the knowledge he just teach you. they need time for break too. so I suggest our school should change to this model, extending the school day two hours for four day.

I think we should not allow the student to bring there cell phone to school because they only use it to play or text that why peoples grade are low and 10% of people are failing.

DC247D62DB3E,"Why do people need to follow their own instincts and ideas?

I think people should make their own decision because they have to follow their own instincts and their own ideas. They have to believe themselves because if you not believe on you ,so no one can believe on you too.

First of all,I think people should make their own decision because they have to believe on themselves. They don't have to think as much because the ideas come from their mine not from someone else. When they have to think of some ideas that mean their don't have to ask ideas from anyone. When they have to do some writing that mean they don't have to copy from someone or from internet.

Secondly,I think people have to follow their own instinct because when something happen to you that mean you don't have to wait for someone to help you solve a problem. They don't have to seek for guidance because you have confidence in yourselves already.

In addition,They have to believe on themselves because if you not believes on you by the way no one can't believes on you too. For example,like when you have to do a presentation in class and you have to present in front of teacher but you not believes that you can do it, so it mean the teacher might not believes on you too. After that is might effect to your grade because when you have to present you keep asking teacher that you say the right thing or wrong.

Conclusion,I believes that people should make their own decision because they have to believes on themselves first before they ask for some help. They have to believes on themselves because if you not believes on you by the way no one else can't believes on you too. Lastly I hope all people believes on themselves first because if you just listen to someone else but you not listen to yourselves that mean you not have enough value.",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.5
DC2E6750CDEC,"Nowadays we live in a world where everything has to be perfect if you wanna fit into this society, therefore humans have made up an exteriotype of how people are supposed to dress, look, act and live. We all have the right to do whatever we want and be whoever we are unless you want to hurt someone. We are free to do what is better for ourselves without being judge, so why do we let society control us?. People should not be afraid to be who they are and show the world what they are made of. All humans are different, we all come with different shapes, sizes, personalities, skills and that is what makes us beautiful, the power of being ourselves.

Experiences make you grow and morph you into a better person, life makes you realize how bold and smart humans are, in addition to this we all have been raised differently so trying to follow an exteriotype is like letting go the opportunity you have been given by life to find out what you are made of, to find oud your power, your way of doing things and solving problems, and last but not least you are letting go the opportunity to make up your own thoughts just because you are giving people the chance to control your mind and the way you think.

I totally agree with this statement, to be yourself in an environment that is constantly trying to make you something else is one of the best decisions you could make, perhaps just by being yourself you could teach someone else how to improve its personality, or maybe you could show them how to act when it comes to solve an issue, theres is multiple opportunities we miss just by trying to be someone else . All humans have a superpower within their selves that they could share with everyone, therefore, trying to fit in, follow an exteriotype and trying to act the same way the others do is equal to not take advantage of our power wisely.

We are afraid of showing who we are because, to us is more important what they would say and think about it. We care more about their reaction towards us and what we do not realize is that maybe they would like more who we actually are than the person that we are trying to be. Once humans face the truth and notice how valuable and special we are, that will mean that we have gotten the greatest accomplishment in life, which is being ourselves no matter what the others say or ask us to do.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0
DC33D5F69792,"In China we don't have the thing that Ralph Waldo Emerson. I know Ralph Waldo Emerson think he is grow up because he beyond he has already mastered. In my opinion people are different, so not everyone can grow up from beyond the things his already mastered. If they beyond the game that they already have play the best, they are not grow up. And there are three reasons I disagree about what Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote looking for new things and learn it make people grow, some small vital can make people grow up, and other vital matter can make people grow up. I am disagree with Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote.

People can look for new things and learn the things to grow up. The new things are not for human control. Students learn new things make their knowledge be more, they can grow up in this way. This is a example of my mom. When she first time can to America, she didn't know any English. She is learn English for three years, now she can talk a little bit English to other. Nobody can say she is not grow up, she learn a new Lagrange she never know before. In my mom story I know not the things you have already mastered in past make you grow up, the new things can make you grow up, too.

People can have many small things that they don't care make they grow up. In a science experiment if you get a small mistake, the all experiment will be destruction by that little mistake. People who learn science, if they make that small mistake they will get their master abusive, nobody knows if the experiment will make people change. I think this is a big things will make people who learn the science grow up. They can control it is happened or not. In this example I learn the little things happen let they know the mall will become the big thing than it will bother you life.

People can have many things in their life can make they grow up. When you go to the society, you will find it is so different between school and society. When you go to the work, you can feel effort is not the only choice, it is many way can get you go to the high lever. If you know this one, now you really become a adult. When you have a wedding with a girl. That will be you best time time, you grow up again. Then if you have a baby, you will get what is the really mean about responsibility. Responsibility make you get a word called grow up. Many things make people grow up the work, wife, kids, and other things make people really grow up.

Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" It may work for Ralph Waldo Emerson or other people, but I disagree what he say. People are different, they have many different way to make they grow up, not the only way like Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. People can study new things to make their knowledge be more. They can learn the things from the small mistake that they made. They can grow up from society. In China it has so many reason make you grow up.",2.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5

In this way students will be able to socialize with other people. Also, they will have the opportunity to do other activities. In this days sudents recive free education and it is easy for them to attend to school. Online programs may have a cost for the courses or classes.

if students attend to schools they will learnd more about their classes because teachers will be able to teach them with enthusiasm. In the other hand, is good idea to recive classes online but you will not have the opportunity to interac with teachers or other students. If you go to school there will be a way that you can make new friends that you can share adventures and stories with them. It will be more benefit for students who go to school than students who stay at home watching their scream on the computer.

Attening school also give you the option to enroll many activies. For example, you can join the football team. music band, and the theater shows. I know a friend that he didn't like to attend school, but when he start to play for the football team at his local school, he was more exiting to speen time at school. At school you can do many actiivities. In contrast, reciving classes online can be a good option for does students that don't have the resources to go to school. For example, if they don't have a bus stop or the school is to far away. Also, for the students with special disability.

The united states have the advantage to have free education. This is a good thing for does parents with not reasourses. Parents can send students to school without worry for a monthly payment. They know that their children are in a good learning place. In the other hand, having classes online may cost a amount of your money. It will be difficult for students because they will have to find a job to soport their online paymants for the courses. In this way have classes online is not a better option for all.

Offering distance learning as an opion for students is not a good advantage for all the people who want to study. it's because many students prefer to attend to school than staying at home.

Recently, my friend Generic_Name were in a problem of what sport should he choose and we all gave out different opinions because some of us think that which sport can benefit our future better, some of us think that is important to match your hobbies and benefit to your body health after you play the sport, but we never think about the sport that Generic_Name like better.

The partnerships with companies and schools allow student to know waht kind of skills need for different jobs. Then students can find out their strong points and select the jobs according to their skills. Studens are good on math work on computer programing,web designing, and computer engineering. Students without internships activities take time to select the work that they want to grow up. They suffer to select their jobs. On the other hand, students with internships activities already had began to grow their occupation. They are heading toward in college as well as their jobs.

Work environment is very importent. Different people like different work environment. We should select the job that attends our demands. Some people like to work individually while other like to work with group. Internships and shadowing allow student to know about different work environments before select the jobs. Some people may say people adjust themselves with the work environment but the question is how long time it will take a person to adjust with the environment?. Also, in a recent report says that we accomplish more when we work in a favorable environment.

All jobs have some requirments. All the jobs do not have same requirements. Some jobs need experience while other jobs do not need experience. Internships and shadowing opportunities help students to get these information from the employers. With these information student get a chance to prepair themselve. They meet the requirement before their high school graduation. People may say that job requirements can be find out in online, but often we get the wrong information from online. By internships and shadowing we are getting right information directly from the employer without any difficulty.

I agree with that stamens because when you have a problem it a chance for you to to your best and overcome it. Unfortunately that not the case. Mostly in sports you are driven to do your best when losing. But adults tend not to do there best when facing a problem. You should be always motivated to do your best.

If you play any sports you know that when you are losing you are motivated to do your best. No mater how many points you are losing by you try your best to make that come back and win the game. If you don't win that game you at least know that you tried your best. If you were to give up you would have wondered, if you tried would I have won. This not the only example, for example you boss is about to fire you and try you best to keep that job. There are many more examples you can try to be your best.

Some times adults have to face problem and they don't know what to do or how to face that problem, they think there nothing they can do. They give up form the start they don't try there best when facing that problem. They simply give up. They miss out on that chance. For example, My dad got fired from his job, he was depressed and did not care at all about anything. He did not try his best. he simply gave up. But you should never give up always give it your best no matter what.

Form trying your best you don't lose any thing you only gain something. you can't follow you dreams without trying you best, does not matter what you want to be. you will face problems no matter what path you take. For example bill gates he did not become one of the most successful people by doing nothing. he gave it his best. So why should you not give it your best .

No matter who you are, you should take the words of Duke Ellington and try you best when facing a problem. Does not matter if you are playing sports or having a issue at work. or trying to achieve you dreams . Never fail to give it your best, or you will regret it.

Reason to have guidance is to release stress or don't add more stress. In daily hours people get stress out a lot at work and could get out of the control very easy,getting help from another one is good idea so you know what you doing and how you doing it. People stress things out and they don't know about what causing it, that give even more stress and have a chance to get an heart attack and lose motive to do work. Guidance could help us by rethinking our plans or working. While taking a guidance you could learn more things that we didn't know of.

Having guidance will also help you keep tack in time and help everything more clean in your work space. It good idea to have an open mind and have work done easier and fast. Having an open mind can give a good mind set in life and think more a head in time and saving time.

Another reason is people have depressing life or have health issuer. Depressing is a big thing that come to life in everyone and it cause a lot problem the way they living. Most of the population on earth have depressing in their life, so it a good idea to seek help at all time. People who having that need get some help from guidance right away to tell them what going on in their life, it could help them cure their depressing.

It a bad idea to to let people guide they own way without any help at all, because trying teach yourself is hard enough, and try to teach yourself might get even more worst because they mind might be wrong and could cause more problem in later runs. People rather do it on their own and not get help because it might give them false inform that they need to learn or think it a waste of time, but guidance are here to help. Having guidance will always help you and they always teach you more things. People can still guide on they own way, but it better to get guidance. It be more easier and get better in live in the long run.

In conclusion, guidance are here to help release stress, learn better, get thought life, cure depressing, saving time, give more open mind it, have work done in time, and make life little bit more easy.",2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.5

E0EBA1995BCB,"First impressions works as a normal form to react to a person, the impressions will depend how scary or funny it is, and how people feel in that moment. Impressions are almost impossible to change, they come instantly, people can not have control of it because first impressions come naturally from the human, the maind sends the first impressions when people are impressed, and people are not prepared to the first impressions. It is impossible to change.

First reason, impressions come naturally from people, they can not have control of it. For example, when people meet with other people, they automatically have impressions of the new people that they are meeting, do not matter what type of people they are, but the impressions naturally come. Second example, people usually move around the country to live or visit, every new place that they are arriving, the impressions come by itself. Third example, during the school year, the students are exploring more about the classes, they even have been not thinking about it, but they already have impressions what the classes talk about, and the students did not can change those first impressions about the classes.

Second reason, the maind has an important work on the first impressions, the mind sends the first impressions to you. For example, when people go to shopping to a marked, they are looking and comparing the prices from other marked. People are having impressions about the prices and their minds are working sending them impressions and also information from the other marked's prices. Second example, people who work on hospital, they are constantly seeing people with cancer, their minds are prepared to make impressions and send them without any difficulty. The type of impression depends how their minds are prepared to react on that situation. Third example, people who come to the U.S from other country normally they are having new impressions, their minds are having a big change. The mind is who make the biggest work to give the first impressions and adapt to the new type of live.

Third reason, people are not prepared to the first impressions that they have during they are discovering new things, it come by itself. For example, when people go to the cinema to see the new movie about the world, they do not have any idea about what is waiting for them, they just infer that the movie is about the world, but stating the movie they start to have impressions. the impressions come without notice them. Second example,when people got 18 years old, they are not prepared to do everything by himself, they start to have impressions on how hard if the life outside with more responsibilities and without their parents. Impressions always surprise people because they never prepare for it. Third example, people who are starting new job, they are learning how to do it. They are having impressions how the job is, they were not prepared for those impressions that they are having during they are learning the new job.

In conclusion, first impressions are almost impossible to change, because first impressions are naturally from the people, it come instantly as result of a new thing that people learn. And mind has an important work on the first impressions, the mind is who send the first impressions to the person. Also, people are not prepared to the first impressions, it come as a surprise. People just explore new things and impressions come as a result.",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0
E1ACA6A0198E,"Hi, my name is Generic_Name and I am interested in pursuing in Microsoft Engineering. I am experienced with most Microsoft products that they have made through out my whole life. I am also experienced with Microsoft Software that they have created.

I should be elected to work with Microsoft because Iv'e been using Microsoft products through out my life. For example I use there gaming console, laptop, tablet, and there desktop. I have experience with Microsoft products and I know how there system works. Iv'e study how they first made the gaming console and I also study how they made the Microsoft tablet/laptop. Iv'e been buying Microsoft products through out my whole life and that shows that I love there products and it shows how supporting I am to Microsoft company. I don't just use Microsoft products I also study the products and how the system works. An average person would just buy the project to use but they care less how the system works. In the other hand I care how the products works because its interesting. I also fixed broken Microsoft products therefore the only reason I knew how to fix it because I learned about the products and Iv'e studied them.

My second reason why I should be elected in Microsoft Engineering is that I am very experienced with Microsoft software and programs. I use Microsoft software on a daily base because I use there software to work on something or to study them on how the software works. Most people use Microsoft software, For example Microsoft Word. People use word too type an essay or something really important. Most people know how to use Microsoft Word because its built to be simple, but in my case I know more tools and know more stuff about the program. Iv'e studied most of the tools that Microsoft has to offer in there software and trust me there is a lot of more stuff you can do with Microsoft word then just type a simple essay. Most people only know the basic tools in word and that proves that they are not interested in the software then just to do a quick essay. I have studied most tools and all Microsoft software's. Iv'e taken classes to learn about these tools and more about Microsoft programs. It taught me a lot of stuff then an average person. The Microsoft Industry most likely want people to know how to use there programs and software's because they are most likely going to make the employee's use the programs.

Some people may disagree with me that you don't have to be experienced with Microsoft software's and products because they think in order to get the job they will have to spend money to purchase Microsoft products and there monthly programs. They also may disagree about me having to know more tools and skills about Microsoft software's is a better way to get the job. I will say they are wrong because in reality most jobs would prefer people who are experienced with there product and software because then they dont have to teach a lot of stuff to the new employee. It also shows that they where interested in there product even way before they where interested in the job. Most jobs I will say want people who are experienced in there products because it shows that you enjoy there company and it shows that you will do great things for the company. Better and skilled people equals faster progress and thats what company's want.

I should be elected into Microsoft Engineering because I endure the company and enjoy everything that they have to offer. I am skilled with most of there software and most of Microsoft products. I will do great things for the company and make the company better then ever.                ",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.5,3.5
E21038BEF290,"Could Impressions Change

In this prompt statement i disagree sometimes impressions can change time after time, but some people need help of how to control it ,or they may not know how to express them selves in front of people some impressions change by you trying to say something,a person maybe happy one day and the next day mad, or the person may not like you.

Impressions could change in many ways we as citizens, have so many expressions of how we should confront others. Some of the popularity of the United States don't like people because of their impressions, but some citizens hate it when they have the same impressions too. Even though people have problems of how their impressions work also they say that citizens may need help of how to control their: sadness,anger,happiness,and fear when they give impressions to others. Teachers in schools say they have problems with kids attitudes this year of how they approach others, and of how they approach their teachers too. We as citizens can't help of how we express, give impressions,and how to put our emotions out their even so you can't trust your parents,friends relatives for help nor the teachers the government can't help us or the president .

People can change their impressions;in so many ways of thinking they can: ask for help, ask for advice,and talk with someone about it.

Impressions can be held in different ways of being they can be held by trying to go for something at the store,eating ice cream, talking with someone close.

Parents think that their kids or others won't change their impressions towards others even though they think that there can be a possibility that can happen you can try and approach your kids by sitting down with them,giving them time to help them,trying to understand them.

Impression can change in many different ways,but it's not impossible to make that change sometimes impressions can be helped by others some of the people in the U.S. have problems trying to say good impressions about how they feel,wanting to confront a person,but others just might dislike that person they might also have hate in them,but they might not.

Into today's economy people are the same of their impressions,some citizens have the problem of dealing with those impressions,although they have the same emotions but also the same expressions. Everyone has a different background, so they may have different impressions of everybody around them. Impressions can be changed nothing, is impossible to do unless you give in the effort to do it or not try to have confidence of who to trust let impressions change or not nothing is impossible to do unless you put your mind into it.

E21BAA47A9F4,"People almost always credit their success by having a good attitude because they treat people the way they want to get treated, it makes other people happy and it makes the them happier. Having a good attitude to another person makes that same person give you that same attitude back, and to other people. They spread good vibes, and it makes them feel happier. Giving a complement to someone every day can lead them to doing the same thing. Having a good attitude can lead to having good karma so next someone says ""nice shoes"" to a random person. That someone will get treated with good karma like passing their test the next day.

Having a good attitude to people at school can lead to having more friends, and getting treated better. By treating the teacher with respect, and kindness. It can make the teacher do you same thing back. Good attitude is the key to success, and every famous person you see on TV always has a good attitude. Maybe thats why there successesful and famous all that hard work they put into their job. When someone has a good attitude it's most likely thier happy, or everyone they talked with was happy.

But sometimes there's a sad person and to make thier day or cheer them up a complemant can help. By saying their outfit looks good, or their hair cut looks better than last time. It can cause them to feel better and do the same thing back to someone else that's having a bad day. There's also people that have good attitudes to make them selfs feel better It's like leaving chruch you fell happier. But coming to church it's just feels good.

Having a bad attitude can effect other peoples mood it can make them happy or sad. Having a good attitude makes more people happier and feel calm. Attitude effects almost all of the day and other peoples day including your family and pets. If your mad all day it's because someone was mad to you or just got effected by it from someone eles.

It's just better to have a good attitude all day than being mad all day and causing other people to be mad insted of being happy. Being happy in the worst times in your life is a good thing and can change your fellings somehow. I would rather have a good day in a bad day than have a bad day. If half of the world had a good attitude next thing you now the whole world has a good attitude. But people don't like doing that they rather be mean to other people and that's why the whole world is violent and wars start and people die Because people don't have good attitudes.

Good attitude effects a lot of people like in music and in movies sometimes it's good and sometimes it's bad. People that are famous and have bad attitudes are really common they get mad at their fans but the fans is the only reason why their famous and rich. Rich people are usually the sad ones and the poor are usually the happier ones because they have better attitudes.

Good attitudes effect a lot and so do bad ones that's why thiers all types of people in the world. Good ones and bad ones the ones with good attitude and the ones with bad attitude. Good attitudes effect friends and family and that's why people should always have good attitudes. One time I was testing and I had a good attitude but when I saw my score I had a bad attitude for the rest of the day. And the same things happens when my parents are mad at each other it gives me a bad attitude for the rest of the day in school and in soccer. But when someone is nice to me or gives me a complement I feel better about myself and it chages my attitude.

Sometimes having a good attitude in the worst times is bad like having a good attitude in a funaral or at a sad movie. But sometimes it's best to be happy and have a good attitude to spread good energy to other people and family. It's sometimes good to have a bad attitude so people can know your sad and be happier near you to cheer you up. Being nice and having a good attitudes can really change someones day so try it and complement people so they will do the same thing back.

I usually have a good attitude even when I have a really bad headache or am sick because having a bad attitude is not fun. and it makes other people have bad days or feel bad so that's why I always have a Good attitude. To other people and my family so they will all have a good attitude and that's why having a bad attitude is bad because it causes bad thing and we don't need that we need to be nice and help other people. Thats why people are so mean and don't care.

And that's why problems start and people get mad and that's why you should have a good attitude everyday to make other people happier.        ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5
E2687856AA7D,"School districts should not allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. Those programs force the students to take summer or evenings courses, don't allow them to take elective classes, or students might not have the time that they need to be prepared for college. This information can help students to think more about their decitions, and have a successful life.

Summer, or evening courses can always be stressful for some students. Sometimes, they will not have time for family activities, or they might not have the opportunity to get involved in sports that they like, which is a good way to spent time with other students. It is also very important to know that students need time to rest, a free time when they can sleep and release the tiredness.

The elective courses during the school year should be available for all the student that wish to improve their knowledge. For example, learning other kind of things can encourage students to think about more ideas for their future, and develop new skills on many activities. Taking away the opportunity of students to choose any of elective courses, and forcing them to complete all the hard classes that they need is not a good solution. That will make students to force themselves to do hard work, which can end up in a failing situation.

In other words, its very important for students to be prepared for college. Also students should have the sufficient time to prepare, and choose the career that they really want. If in case students are not sure about what career they want, four year of High School should be enough time to learn more about carrers. For example, students will have more opportunities to attent college day also, they could go visit, and get information about any college that they are interedted on. Being well prepared is the best key to bulid a good future nad accomplish dreams.

This decition should be made by the school district to eliminate this programs, and let the students have a comfortable schedule for thier everday activities. spending more time at home with family, and refreshing their minds it's better than summer courses. Students should know that getting involved in elective classes is more fun, and bieng well prepared for college is more important. Even though students know it's going to be a longer way, it would benefit them in the future.        ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,3.5

However does that believe that is not a good idea that students commit at the young age one reason is that they will file tire , because when they want to pay atention to math class and they see that the teacher is talking to much they are going to say no I want to sleep to to be in this class borring,second when they are in the corridor study for a quiz and they will be talking about the career and when they are going to take the quiz they will know nothing because they did not study .

Does who believe that is a good idea for students to commit a career at the young age give one reason ,one reason is that tey can see can the life is very hard and they will have to do there own thing ,second is that they can buy a car so because if they shoes a good career they are going to resif a lot of money so can have a car and help there family with other thing at home .

Finally that career it have to be good some you are not going to be looking for another commit career because you try hard and ask you family and teacher to help you to fun a good one, second if you like that career you most talk wit you mom or dad that you are happy with that and tell you teacher that help you to found that career and tell her can you will talk to other students to come and talk to the teacher so she can help them .

Inconclution people shoud agree that students can commit a career because it will help other students that are in High School and wants to be someone in the future they vere found what career do they want to work or study for ,second they will feel for good if they get the thing by there own ,thrid if they are traying to make something in their country their very try to talk to someone a friend or other person that can help them ,finally they can get more oportunity if they study hard and them founf they career that they wants .",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0

Somehow, recollections can give you positive or negative effects. If a person had a bad impression, it can gives you anxiety, which is a person needs to get help about negative satiation. It doesn't matter how bad or how good the impressions are, it is important how people get effect.

Second, I remember when I was first grade in elementary school, I did not want to go to the school. It was the first day I wanted to stay at home. On that day, I was a little bit bored, I took the big pillows from armchairs then put them together. I was trying to jump from the pillows to the other sofa. The first time I jumped it was successful. After a moment my mom caught me. I was kind of scared, she told me it was dangerous, and I can hurt myself with that.

After she left, I put the pillows together like I did it before, then I jumped to the wall. The walls corner was really sharp, and I hit to the wall. I realized I hurt my self so bad. Then I went to my mom, I was holding my head and crying. She was so mad at me, then I took my hands off from my head, it was bleeding so much. She called my dad, then we went to the hospital.

E4C49D70C330,"What would happen if the school menu is change? Most of the kid will be upset because the menu have all the delicious food they like. This does not mean this food is healthy.

United States is consider the country were more fast food is distributed and consumed, and also where more people die because of their high cholesterol.

Now a days with all the technologies advantages people is doing less exercise and moving less , for example: We use the car to go everywhere so we walk less ; we do not even need to walk to talk to a person , we can just send them a text ; even to see the weather outside we do not need to stand up ,we can just check the weather in our phone; we have got to a point where if we are to lazy to go to the cinema we can just stay home and watch Netflix,Hulu, Disney or any phone app.

All this is great but at the same time is making lazy people more lazy and more fat , witch is causing more medical problems; like hart attacks , high cholesterol.

In a future if we do not change anything this it will get worse.

A way of helping the future kids like the students from this school would be by teaching them that there is more than fast food , that there is also healthy food that can taste awesome and some even better than the unhealthy food, for example: avocado, fruit juice ,Cesar salad, fish,etc. That all this types of food can create a balance between eating what your body need to work correctly , and what it want to eat.

One way of showing them other variety of food , is by the school menu. The menu could contain food that the kids have never taste before , and that could have less fat than a pizza.

This way when they get older they will not only look for , hamburgers , Chinese food or chicken wings. They will know there are more options that could help them with their body.

And if we do not teach them this habit right now it will be a lot more hard to get them in the healthy habit in the future.

In my opinion considering being part of the school community and thinking about my future and my classmates

I think that including a more healthy menu in the school cafeteria would be one of the best ideas for everyone. We do not want to have any medical problems because of the food we eat.

E4F813D54870,"In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. I strongly disagree with this prompt because once we enter high school we are transitioning to a bigger school with more new subjects that catches our attention. My reasons for disagreeing is that I was once a rising ninth grader and I would be unhappy with the career I wanted in my freshman year. For example when I first came into high school as a ninth grader I wasn't sure of what I wanted to be once I graduate. Now I am a senior at Generic_school and I have two option to choose from.

In my perspective I believe that at a young age mindset changes; you find new interest in things and also our mind isn't fully developed at ages fourteen or fifth teen; we aren't mature wisely on what we want. I think the student should started preparing them self once they're in junior year which is when they're a eleventh grader. My reason for saying that is because you're close to graduating and need to start planning your future, looking for scholarship, and making sure you want the career you've chosen for a long period of time.

I don't think its a bad idea but i wouldn't agree with it because I know how this generation is like and we need more teacher to start talking to them seriously about life after high school. These past year a huge amount of student have dropped out of school because they do not feel like they have support from teacher, friends, or even their own parents; or maybe the student think they can't afford college; not many teacher talk to them about financial help or support.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

E54E238C6DDB,"I would think that some student's would stay home so they can catch up on things they need but some stay so they can get the help they really need. For example if a parent see's his child struggling they could ask their child and be like do you need help or what do you want us to do to help you. I'm pretty sure that some students are gonna take this opportunity, and take online classes or get the help they need from a teacher or someone they know who can help them. The real reason that I think they will do it is because they would want to graduate from school so they can get the diploma and be happy that they did it with the help of a parent. Yes, I do believe that student's would benefit with taking classes at home or by online classes with a video conferencing. Student's should be grateful that some school's are giving them the opportunity to take some classes at home or even with a teacher they can video chat with and they can help them too. If it wasn't for the school who was giving us the privilege do take this opportunity for the help then we wouldn't be passing anything or getting the help we need. For example, if a student goes to the school and tell's them hey i'm having trouble getting this subject i know for sure the teacher are gonna give them a choice to pick if they want help or take online classes at home with like a teacher who's helping them. Another reason kids ask for help is because they probably ask at home and sometimes's parent's dont have the time to help them cause they are tired from work or they just tell them to ask someone else and then they don't get the help they need. For some student's it's easy for them but for some it isn't easy so some students can help each other so they can understand it. For other reason's it's better for kids to try on there own first and then if they still dont get it then they ask for the help or ask the teacher for help at the same time. In conclusion i think it's a good idea that the school can give the benefit for student's to take online classes so they can get the help they need.

Sometimes the first impression can be good.

However if we do bad things like with our girlfriend if we treat bad her the parents are going to have a bad impression and that can change or with our friend if we don't help or if we give bad adviser to him the parents can think bad about us even if the first time we get a good impression.

However even if I give a first bad impression that will change if in the same interview we use a good language and if we respond the answer properly that can help you and finally in my own interview a give a bad aspect but I use the correct language in the interview and I get the job that's why I think that can help you in a interview when you get a bad impression.

In conclusion the first impression not always It's impossible to change if we know how to deal with it.",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0

If you do everything with your phone you can loose you vision beacuse the telephone has to much light, but you can play the games and not talking with nobody.

for example in this time the parents when their children start crying they just give them the cell phone, why they do that beause they now the kids gonna addicted to wacht videos then that gonna be a problem with the kids when they grow up they don ganna talk with nobody but that not de kids fall beacuse they parents teach then how to use the cell phone but they dont teach them how to talk with people, they need to lear how to talk with older people or teach them how to do other stuff.

this is another example when parents go to the shopping stores and they are in the store they losse their kids they are always in the phone they never can missed call but they can missed their kids that not make sense because when they found the kids they star to saying thing.

my opinion is we need to talk more share our ideas or meet more friend that better to be everyday in the phone talking with people's like my mother always told me dont tlak with bad people but the thing is we never now when they are bad but that why we need to do everything carefull, is better to meet peoples in person.

If the student have 17 or 18 years old he can leave the school and not when they have 22 years old like the hispanic because they coming with 15 or 16 years old and the school put they in grade nine and if you graduate in only three years is better for you, becuase they going to was 18 years old and they already for to work in learned more english but that not is the same case for American People.

With the work force for to finish the school in one year early, I think that is hard but is so good for students with 18,19,20 years old because they can finish early in lirobic time in one year.

If you're hispanic that's not better choice for you, because you can't learn more english and that's going to be hard for you when you start work, but that not is the samein the case with American People because the english not is a problem with they and if they have the same years old they can get a good job and leave the school in lirobic time.

That's what i think about the finish the school in three and not four years and the work force for to finish the school in one year early, If the school give me the oportunity choice I say ''I want to finish the school in three years'' because is better for me for my years old .",2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.5

First, yong students are late born then older student. Their parent might atempt their student early or late to school. Young students needs alot of stuff to be teach. Some studednt might be smart or intelligant then other. It depends on their skills of listening and reading. If they do well on listening or reading or others, they will gete smarter.

Second, when the young students gets older, their starting to change and turning into a teenager. Student also start growing like the other older students. When the students gets older, they will have a deploma paper like other studetns will get. Students starts at a different subject then others.

Most likely, olderer students are brilliant then the younger students. They're are available to any program with other students. The older students studys alot then the younger because they get prepare for any test their gonna take. Students also goes to many program when teachers assign them to go, and get important details about that program.

Finally, older and younger students are most likely different comparing to each other. Their both have different reading, writing, and speaking skills. The most important thing about older and younger student is that the older studentes like to help the younger students.

I disagree imagination is more important that knowledge.

I disagree because, I think knowledge it's more important because, you have to knowledge after you imagine because, I think knowledge it'a more important because you have to knowledge. The situation to think really good if you dont due you can not think what it's gonna happen.

because if you only imagine you don't gonna knowledge good because, if you only imajinate and say the words after you knowledge the words you what to says. and if you knowledge first after think you can be able to due son tings.

If you gonna to due a story if you only imagine you can not be able to due because you have to Knowles the situation first after you think because son times you can get good imagination and you have to knowledge.

like for example if don't knowledge you don't gonna now were put tings to knowledge the situation were you gonna put things and the ca n be better.

I don't no what scientists Albert Einstein think and i gonna now what he thinks because, people have different opinion like how it's more better to they can use, and because persons have different ideas,like me i think then knowledge it's more important, then imagination but others people they can think it'snot because for people to see things it's different, because if the person am gonna write the story am gonna use the knowledge to knowledge, the situation better and make good story.

The knowledge it's like then a group because you have to search or knowledge to now what you gonna due because, if you only have in a imagination to what you gonna due that can work, like when you go to your job and you have to knowledge,what you gonna due for the day.

when you go to school and you go to science if you have to examine the a plant you have to knowledge the plant to now were you can star to examine the plant.

when you due sometimes you have to knowledge the situation,like for example,when a person quilled to another person, the police they have to knowledge,the scene and who was the criminal and knowledge the situation how died and who was .

some people think the imagination it's was first and it's more important would, I think the people see for different forms to due would a think some people it's right because, I see for different forms like when you imajinate it's like when you imajinate the things would you can have a picture in your minds like you can see pictures like were you what to put things.

but you can have im imajine in your mied but you have to knowledge first because i think if you knowleged because i feel more necesary to knowleged beause when you knowledged you can feel it's more easy or if you look like the pictures way it's more easy, because you see the things more specific en your miend.

it's alot ways to you can see things because for people some people looks diferets to others you can see more better in you way if you don't get.

This will be a great idea for many students that has trouble doing their homework at home or doesn't understand or their stuck on their homework, but the other reason people don't want to add this club to the school is they don't like the idea of having it they say ""it's a waste of time for us"" or other more things that they say, some other students might say they don't have time for it or they don't wanna join the club.

I think the should not be pair with younger kids. If a older kids does something bad the younger ones might do it to. It can go super wrong like if a older kid does a trick in a skateboard. The older knows how to do it. But the younger does not know how to do it he can break . Something arm or leg. One my brother was with his friend doing trick on his skateboard and i tried to do it but i fell and Brock my arm.\

I think older kid should not be around younger kids. Because they can be on drugs or be smoking who knows. That bad for younger kids if a kid see you smoking all the the smoke can go to his lungs and maybe give him cancer or die. My fiend Generic_Name brother was smoking around us we told that smoking can kill us and him bu he didn't Leasing.

I think older kid should be respectful to younger kid and everybody. So they don't to be like them if you're respectful to other younger kids can be respectful to others. But if you're not respectful other are not going to be respectful. One my friend brother was not being respectful to us so we were not being respectful to him.

E8C554B25F19,"Do our character have to be formed by that way the we performed or by influences. Your character will be what yourself choose to make it. We should formed our character by influences beyond our control.

In addition, by the influences that we receive day by day we chooses how to be creating our character. For example, I introduced my character in the situations the I pass, that help me how to be a better person. Also, sometimes we take our family advice, they tried to persuade our character by doing incorrect things. In others words we can said that they just want to influences our self because they ready pass for al this things that is good because we can see how much love they have to us. Is wonderful when your mom tell you the she can't believe that way the you get influences because sometimes we don't want to get they advice but all that they said is correct event if we don't want to believe then. For example my parent always want the betters things to me but i know if i don't try to fix my character I going to have less opportunities to have a better job or a better future. Also, Things are necessary somethings is hart to change our character because we think the we are okay but other think all the appositive, so we never have to think the we are fine because the never is going to happened always we have to be better in some thing we need to be honest with our lives and accept what we are doing wrong is more better to accept our errors and there is went we are going to see how our character change in a better way and then we are going to feel happy about our character and our lives.

Moreover, The influences control our character by the way the we act and think. For example, I was a person the if something I don't like I really have to talk to you the was horrible. Also my mom help me to change my character in my way to act because went sometimes people tell me things the I really don't like I do bad faces to then, I was doing bad with that. In other way, we don't think in the consequences of having a bad character, sometimes we don't think if others are going to see the actions in our lives and they maybe are going to influences you but no we the same attitude, because some people have bad attitude to but all the influences help you in life because if you don't like the people act with a bad attitude you don't have to be like that to. Also, you have to be prepared to make the decisions of what changes you are going to make. Having a good character gives you large of opportunities people always is looking for person with a good character,because costumer look the. In addition, all thinks the people said about you help you with your character, don't feel sad because you change your way to think. Obviously the take your time because you are not going to change in one morning but with a professional character more doors are going to open and more opportunities came so take other people influences.

Some people argument the we should choose our own character traits, because some people just are going to tell you bad opinions in the way the you have to act. Moreover, some people believe the is no necessary to get a great character. In other hand we have to feel free in what we want to do we know what we need to change we don't have to do what others want because sometimes they just look for they benefits what is better for then and that dont have to be like that. In addition, some people don't care if you are okay, or how you feel. In addition others argument the is necessary listen to others influences because sometimes we don't find a way to resolve our character problems bur other know what to do and they try to find a way to make you live easy. For example, I know some people the dont know how to control they character when they are mad soy they contact person the know how to act in the situations. Also, some people take careers for find solution to person the have serious problems with they character I really dont know if is normal the people get mad went they want to eat, I have a friend with the problem in my point of view the is not normal because i never pass from the situation so I can't help her but people the have long time studying on the yes they can tell her what way to eat or i don't know but they have a solution for the problem in her character. In Addition all this problems can help you to have a good character a better attitude because is necessary for talk with other because we need to have a way a formed how to talk without breaking they feelings because as humans the we are we feel sad went other trade us with a mad face and sometimes we performed don't talk to then. So always remember the a good attitude change to many things.

In Conclusion, sometimes is necessary be influencing by other because they give you different ways how to be working in your character. In addition they received influences by other help you with the control in your character by changing a your way to act and covert you in a better person. Also help your character in a better way to think, in be focus on your ideas. In conclusion all this things are necessary in whatever way the you want to used then because in the proved of the live all things are necessary event if are smalls things they are necessary don't thing the people just influences your self in change your character because they just want to fight with not the is not like that is people is trying to give you a better influences about how you have to act because they always want better things to you. Always if you do bad on your character they are going to tell you and I thing the is more better if they tell you what you are doing wrong the others persons the you don't know came just for the just because you don't want to obey always think in you future.

E91F2E8986B2,"If you master a subject you like and dont try pushing your limits you wont succeed.

Why wouldnt you want to push your limits?

Theirs a reason why people get stuck in life, when they master their subject.

They get fustrated when they can't find jobs or good pay wage.

I agree on what Author Ralph Waldo Emereson because if you dont have that motivation on what you master it can affect you.

If you dont push yourself into doing more than beyond than life will not treat you as you wanted.

I agree on Author Ralph because I've experience things in life that if you dont try on something , than you wont be able to grow.

If you look at bill gates he master on his program and what did he do he share his product and open stores. He grew just by mastering his program. My experience was mastering in learning how rebuild a engine from just the block to how to make more power. Now im fixing peoples cars and doing tunes for their cars.

I know these guys that called themself diesel brothers. They are master diesel technician. So what did they do? They bought a shop , got a crew and got sign to do a tv show. They work on diesel trucks, diesel cars and anything that is diesel. Then they decided to do custom trucks and custom military cars. That wasn't enough for them, so they came up with ideas to use military axles and putting them on custom trucks making those trucks so heavy duty they can even pull a train!

My father told me that you should never stop, even if you reach that goal. He said,"" you reach that goal make another goal, you can't stop at what your doing and if you do,than theirs going to be bumps in the road and than your going to make huge mistakes."" just from those words it's like million bucks to me. Why because if you stop at what you master ,than somebody is going to master it better than you ever thought and your not going to grow from it.

When they master their subject, those people get happy right but whats next? Lets say you master your subject and than you find a job that pays good. The money looks good and you stay at that job for a couple of years. I'd say that probably 75 percent of you staying at that job will make your miserable. People get bored and can't find nothing else to do,but do the exact samething over again. It's going to make you want ot quit and find something else to do. Then once you quit your job what's going to be in your mind? Probably nothing at the moment,but then your realize that you master that subject and want to share it, make it to your own business and improve from it.

So I do agree on what Author Ralph waldo Emerson wrote. I believe that if you dont go beyond your goal than you wont succeed in life. So make sure that you push yourself even if its harder. I promise you that you will succeed,have better thought, better examples and freedom. Remember having to do more you will get more in return.     ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5
E952F0EB5083,"Former British Prime Minister once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". I disagree with this statement. In my own experiences I have never failed to succeed, I have always failed to fail. In 7-11th grade I have tried out for my school basketball team and never made the team. I have also experienced doing something on my first try and succeeding, Failure never brings success.

All through out my life i wanted to play basketball for my school. The only problem was every year I tried out i never made the team. This year I am a senior in high school and still havent played basketball for my school. I have realized that no matter how good I got it wasnt enough. Personally i can not relate with failing to succeed because it has not happened to me. I have never been able to fail and then succeed.

I can say from my own experiences. Somethings just come to you and your able to keep being good at it. While there are also things that are not able to do on the first try or ever. For instance my seventh grade year I was trying out for football. I had never played a game or ever tried out. First try and boom I am on the football team. I played left tackle and was a starter for ""A-team"". I had never played before and I was already starting. I didnt fail to succeed, I just succeeded.

As a result from the facts I have stated. I do not believe or agree in ""failing comes success"". Failing happens to everyone and I have yet to hear someone say "" I failed to succeed"". It is very uncommon for someone. If it has not happened to me in all of my seventeen soon to be eighteen years of life i dont believe it is possible. ",3.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0

so you do a whole long procisior for getting a one good opinion what you need to do is that ask opinions from two or three people and then if u think it's not a good opinion than think your own and then take a good decission. everyone takes thier own decission i think if you wanna ask for a opinion find a good trustful adult who really really wants to help you who will give you a better choice and then think about it if you think that she or he is right then just follow the directions for example i have a birthday party and i need to select the dresses for everyone and arrange the birthday party and i don't have enough time i am so worried and confiused i don't known what to do .

i need a help from people i asked from my friends, cousins ,family, teachers and then i think that i have a lot of opinions so i can't choose

1 so what i did was i asked my older cousine and then we discused about that she told me in details what to do and then i managed my time and i choosed the dresses i arranged the birthday party in one week everything was so good that's how we make better chioce for our self if u can't do that at least think on your own or ask for help and ask from a good person not anyone you don't know well becuase people can play with you so we have to be carefull so i think asking an adult is more better than asking a lot of people becuase asking an adult will help you more becuase the first time i need help and i asked a lot of people and i was so confiused and i was like what is going on with me because it was my first excperience i didn't use my mind it was so bad waste of time every thing was ruined and that's why i learned something is never do anything that your parents or adult don't like here is another way to make a better choice and that is always listen to your parents and your adult because sometimes the decisions that you are making it seems like they are good but after some time you realize that it's not good for you u get in trouble and all you have face somethings so thats why do what your parents are telling you to do not what you wants to do it's ok to listen to your heart but sometimes it's not so the best way to make a better choice is listen your parents and adult

2nd is use your mind to think that it's good or bad the 3rd way is to ask someone who is an adult and such a nice and truthfull person believe in your self and your god these are the best ways to make a better choice we should always believe in your self and your parents because they will always tell you a thing that is good for you no matter what it is just think that yuor parents tell you to do that and again believe in yourself if you will everything will be good if you be feel good believe in your god becuase he will help you everywhere he is with you so these are the best way to make a good choices are these..",1.5,1.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0

For example what if a student wants to go pick up his grandma from the airport but her flight gets in while the student is still in school. If school would've ended at the normal time he could've went to pick up his grandma. Even though staying an hour more would help students more, there won't be anytime left for after school activities. in the winter time it gets dark fast and some kids like to go outside and play for a while after school,but if they add that extra half an hour kids would have to get home fast and leave there stuff to go outside for a little bit. There are many bad reason why adding another hour to school is a bad idea but, there are many good ones too like a good reason would be kids can catch up on there missing work, a bad idea is kids go home later then they used to and some parents would not like that. If they do add an hour of school they should open the school at 8:30 instead of 7. If we come at 8 kids would get more sleep and not fall asleep in class with more sleep kids have more energy and with ms are more energy kids are more productive. In my opinion i don't think adding another hour is not so bad, just that no other student would wanna stay another hour.

EC5138D8C9D6,"I dont think thats good what they doing with the student because there school are not letting then choose there career or what kind of career they want to follow i think is a bad thing what they doing because they not letting the student study what he wants they are choosing what the student can and the career that he is going to follow , i say thatthe student have to say what he wants to be ansd what the they want to study.

From the point the im seeing the situation i dont think in those societies are giving, them a good reason for them to simmit a career,to the student because they are choosing the career for the students and they not letting them to follow a career, that they like because in school they are selecting the classes for the students ,that they are going to follow for only one specific career, and for the age ,that they have i dont think thats a good idea to summit a career because ,you have time to choose what king of career you want to follow and by taking classes for a career that you want and having the time ,and then you think your ready you can summit a career , because what they doing in the school is choosing what the student is going to be went he grows up.

They not letting the student to select there classes that are going to help then in the future for a career , in the school that they going they are selecting the classes ,for the students they not helping them , what they doing is ,that they are giving classes for only one career , and i dont think that they should summit acareer because, they not choosing a career that they want tey are choosing a career, that they giving to them with the classes that they making them have, so student dont have the much career to folow they taking whatever they giving to them.

in conclusion im not agree with what they doing with the student and they still not on the age to summit careers , went they get to the point at school is went you star looking for a career and what you like and what is making you follow the career and i would say ,that if u still in school it dont matter but the school they cant choose what you going to be you have to chose what you going to do and what you like the most and follow your dreams not what others say the you can do do or what you can be you have decide what you going to do the school is to teach you not to chose who you going to be.",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5

ECF0CBAE7E06,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, '' Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.''

I disagree with Emerson's statement, because you can keep growing by trying and trying hard on whatever you already know.

However; when you try and keep trying somehting is when you grow up more and more each time.

Additionaly, we grow more with stuff that we are good already, because we become more and more greatful.

Primaly, we think that by trying what we already know, it makes us better each time.

Generic_school made a survey to all seniors to get everyone's opinion base on ''Unless you try to do something beyod what you have mastered, you will never grow''. sevendy five percent of students desagree, they said that you learnd more and more of what ever you already know.

In my expecience I have become more and more good of what I already know.

Therefore, knowing more what you already know and you are good at it, you will become better and better each time, never give up on what you are already good at.

Secondary, expericences make us better, we learnd more of we already know, of what we are capable to do.

We have a company that has to do with Generic_school, they go to a lot of schools to talk the the juniors, and seniors of what they think about Emerson's statement.

fifty percent agree and the other fifty persent desagree, because some student say that we need more new stuff to keep succesing in life, and other say that we can still seccess with what you already know.

In my opinion I totaly desagree, sometimes we can keep and keep trying what we already mastered is either you become better or just fail in life.

Therefore trying your best and working hard base on what you already know helps you to grow more in life.

ED81EC443A69,"I remember one summer vacation, that my family and I took, where we went to another state to visit another relative that we haven't seen in awhile. Summer vacation had been the same for many years, summer vacation is when teenagers take a break from school to enjoy what they like to do during their free time. By having a long summer vacation, does not affect students to retain information from the past. teens should know that summer vacation is when they can enjoy their break to do what they want for fun.

First reason, why teens should know that summer vacation is for them to enjoy, is because they can spend time with their family. For example, the whole family can got to another state to visit another relatives that they have not seen in awhile. By spending more time with their family; consequently, teens can be more closer to their family. Teens can also, enjoy their summer vacation with their family by playing video games, watching movies, and go on a road trip.

another reason, why teens should know that summer vacation is for them to enjoy, is that they can hangout with friends. teenagers hangs out with friends to go to a party, or to watch a movie. by hanging out with friends teens can do what they think is fun for them and their friends. For example, teens can have a fun time playing pool with their friends or just by going to a gym. In addition, teens can also have fun with their friends by having a sleep over or go for a camping trip.

Lastly, on why students should know that summer vacation, is for them to enjoy, is that they are away from school, by being away from school students can have more time to have fun and do the things that are important to them. For example, students can stay up late and does not have to wake up early in the morning. However, teens can have more time in their hands, instead of having to learn.

In conclusion, these are the three most important opinions, on why teens should know that their summer is for them to enjoy, by having more time for summer vacation, teens can enjoy more time with their family and friends.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5
EDA3FF6D2DCA,"This is true for me ""example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."". If you talk someone for one thing, information, film, music, game, ... Best support for your idea is examples. I think is the only thing for support your idea. You don't have other options But never mind you have a one more way for influence others everybody know this way because is the best way of everything it is the money.

Once upon a time me and my friend talking about one film (i did not remember the film name know.) we are saying only examples (because we know is the best way for support our ideas) he is saying one example i am saying another and we are talking like a 30 or 35 min finally i gave up and i said if you accept my idea i will buy a large size pizza and he said OK.

After for this conversation i learned example and money is not the main thing influencing others; it is the only thing

Although some people may think its okay to be yourself in a world where its always trying to change you , nevertheless , some people may think is not okay to be in a world where its trying to always trying to change you into something else because people should express them self how they want to they shouldnt be in a world where its constantly trying to make them into something else and people should live how they wanna live.

For example , people should express them self how they want to be they shouldnt be in a world where its constantly trying to make them into something else. People have all right to be who they wanna be but if you in a world where it is trying to change you that is not a great accomplishment. Clearly people should be who they wanna be.

Therefore , people should live how they wanna live. Everyone picks how they wanna live in a world some people pick to live in a world where people get to pick who they wanna be and some people pick for them self who they wanna be. But its NOT okay to live in a world where everyone picks for you u not making a great accomplishment for yourself. If your making a change for your self you should be living in a world where it doesnt judge you for trying to be something you wanna be and you turn your self around and be come something where everyone want you to be a they call it ""great accomplishment"" .",3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0
EE855A723FE0,"First of all Hello, Ms. In my opinion I think that is better to work in group. I have 3 reasons that I would like to share with you my reasons are that everyone would like to share differents ideas, Also working in group we can finish more early, and we can socialized with different people. Now I'm going to describe you why I choose this reasons. By sharing ideas I meant that everyone can have the opportunity to think and talk about that that person think. Because we don't have the same's idea's as other people thought. After all people in the group share their ideas we can writte in a piece of paper and see which one's are good and makes any sence, about the topic we are talking and we see which one's we can put on the class work we are going to do. Also about that we can finish more early, we can show it to the teacher on time and she can give as her opinion and ask her for some help about what part she think that we can add more especific words or meanings. Because sometimes we think that we have a good project but sometimes we have to figure out what part we can change and put differents things. And the last but not least that we socialized with other's this one is my favorite because in this one I can discribe a little bit of my self when I just came to this country from another I was so shy because no one came to talk to me in my second day of school. In my English class my teacher make a groups and some people start talking with me 2 person from that class help me in my english because it wasn't that good. I was so scare because first everyone was looking to me like I had something in my face and in this country everything is different to my country in this one we need some friends that help us when we need some help in english.

Them I introduce my self to everyone and I start making new friends. When we are new we think that no one is going to talk with us because we are from another country. Sometimes they don't talk with us because we don't speak the same lenguage as other. But we have to try our best to be friendly and make that the person doesn't feel shy we would like to that person feel happy in school and in each classes. Tha's why I think that is good to be working in group not alone. When we have homework or projects we like to have some help then doing by our self that is more hard, the projects are always so difficult or sometimes you don't understand what the teacher said because we are seatting on the back and some students are talking and we could't hear anything about what the teacher is talking about. But in a group they are 2 or more then 2 in the same group is good that one of that person of your group understand and explain to the people didn't get it. The internet is a big problem to alot of us some of us that we don't have internet or computer eather. I think that is a problem for me and one of the reasons that I like working in groups some family doesn't have enough money to put internet in home or buy a computer in home but also go to a public places that have internet and computer we have to pay. But working in group one of the students may have internet and go to that person home. I know that in our school we have computers in the library but on weekends is close the school or some of us we can't stay after school. Because we have to pick our littler brother or sister from other school. But the good thing is that one of us could have computer or internet in home and research some things about our work or project. Another thing that is good working in group is that when we are explaining a project in from in class we don't feel ready because we have to talk a lot or others reasons but in groups we can break parts and each one is going to talk about that part she or he loves more.

My Final opinion that I would like to share is that working is group is a good option then working by our self. Because not all of us have the opotunity to have internet, not all of us speak english some of us we need that someone speak our language for example sometimes I need someone that help me with some words in english that I don't understand because my first language is spanish and it's hard came to a country that don't speak your native language. And we can know new people to talk, not with the sameones because there is a lot of people that we don't talk and they are in the same classes of us we just want to be with the same ones and have to talk with everyone and help then when they need help.

EE99F74CAE44,"Philosopher, Physical, and humanitarian Albert Schweitzer say that example is not the main thing in fluencing others, actually being a example can not be a good thing to influence others becuase first you need to start doing the right thing on your own before you decide to be a example or influence others and that's mean that you need to do everything perfect when that's means that it is hard to do it.

They say that example is not the main thing in fluencing others becuase being a example can be stressfull. For example, they can be stressfull on trying to do everything perfect to do not do wrong things to influence others and they have to be responsible with what they do to not do mistakes so that they can influences others and they feel that it is a very stressfull responsability of influcing others.

However, they believe that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others people and being a good example makes they feel responsible to others and they feel that they have the responsability to do the right way in their own so that they can be a good example to others.

In reality, they say that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others people because they feel that they have the responsibility with their own behavior so they can do the right way in their own first to influence others. They also say the having respect to others is a good example of our behaviors and being humildity is also a nice examples that we can teach or influenes to others. They believed that being honest with anyone is also a good example of our behaviors. For example, they believe that being responsible with their own behavior is a good example to start doing the right way and to influence others because the responsability gives to others respect. They say the being on time in any meeting makes they responsible with their own behavior and gives other a good example of responsability. They say that responsability is a example of our own behavior and can be something that they can learn with the time and needs practice. I believe that being honest with others is a good example by start setting our own example behaviors. I also believe that humildity is a good example of our behavior because the humildity and that responsability is something that I can learn from others with their own actions or their behaviors. For example, I learned how to be responsible with my things for my mom and my dad because they teaches me how to do it and that this need practice too and I also they teaches me that being a example with our own behavior makes you humildity and teaches you how to valore what you already has and accept what

I don't have.

In conclusion, they want to argue that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence other people because being a good example by your own behavior teaches they how to do the things rights, so they can influence others by doing and taking the right way and also teach how to be responsible, honest, and being respect to others.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5
EEB5AAA18E11,"Some people believe that student should be required to take a class in the arts, Or student should take classes such as elective ?

Imagine doing something that makes you happy, An doing something your comfortable at an decide what are your capable of doing in life. People believe that each student should required an electives in school cause people believe that this will help the students find what they want to do, Also this will help them find they skills an get opportunities, And importantly this will helped students in future .

Its really important that students should pick any electives they want to do, Imagine students get an electives they dont want to do. This will have the student feel lazy going to class, An when student feel lazy going to class student mostly skip class. When student skip class students will have a bad grade, An when students get a bad grade they get irritated. And they dont have the motivation so they give up and when students give up they will not receive any credit an students needs enough credit to graduate if a student dont graduate high school the students cant go to colleges. An the student cant have a better job , Also companies would not hire them. people who has no job they could be homeless an its very hard. So this is why it's very important students decide what electives they want to do.

People believe that everyone has their special skills. Students should find they skill taking the electives they really good at cause if a student is good at something they will love to go to class, Also going to class will have student have good grades and would like to learned more things and importantly you will receive an credit.

For example if students is good at drama company will hire them as an actress an people will get famous, Also have their own movie an this will makes a lot of money out of it . also not only a student can only have one skill you could have a lot of skill just not one but more, An this will help a student. If a student has a lot of experience an know a lot of things this will definitely help them. This one of the reason that students should find their skills .

Future is very important for the students cause when a students who takes electives and doing the electives they like an love to do students would take this opportunities to have a good future after graduating high school, Also College cause this when their adult life would begin and things will be different. And this why its very important student take their skill so future would not be hard it would be easy for students, It would have a lot of hard an rough times but with the skills they would get through it . Also this is when the student begin their dreams, An student could use the skills for a better future and things would not be hard for them cause students would know what they doing and what is going to happen also most student would find their destiny, An their destination they would love to be at.

Does Mr. Emerson thought about the people when he wrote his message in his text. Yes he does. He thought a bout it because he clearly is talking to the people in his writing. People shouldn't stop learning other stuff or do other kinds of work because they are professional in one job. I agree with Mr. Emerson about his writing. Many people in society just want to focus in one thing. but that affect the development of the community of work. Also if you never try something new you will never know. and if you do not try you are closing you mind and the opportunity to learn. The people should think about to grow up.

""Commit a career at a young age gives time for students to approach their goals and advance towards the future""

During High School, many Juniors and Seniors are already preparing themselves for college, taking classes that would give them credit and would benefit them as they go, also there are some classes that would provide students lots of experiences, these experiences prepared students in a way for them to see how much effort they must put to approach their goal.

The Board of Teachers in a private school have said that, ""The more early a student starts their way to a career, the less struggle is for them to accomplish it"", because at their young age they have more time, less worries and not that much of responsibility, as a person gets older the more problems and responsibilities come to them, Although students also have many struggles in school, their house etc, is more less then an adult, That is why teachers think that is better for a student to commit a career at a young age because they are less worried.

The percentage of students that commit a career at a young age is high, many of this students received a schoolarships others financial help, because of their behavior and their effort,The other half of this percentage of students have a well financial situation and there is no need for help or schoolarships, although there is a low percentage of students that prefer to work instead of going to college, because of their financial situation,However many students with low financial situation have succeed at their young age because of their effort to accomplish their dreams by working hard and knowing what they want to succeed in.

Commiting a career at a young age could be difficult or it could be simple, there is more students that had said that is a great idea, because your mind at a young age is envolving in everything that surrounds the student, such as important information that would benefit him, as i said, the brain has more potencial to store as much information as it can, because the student is young and is focus on its goals and there is no problems or thoughts that could disstract the student.

Other students had said that is a bad idea in a way of making the biggest decisition, which is choosing what career you want to accomplish, because at that age they do not actually know what they really want.

Parents and the societies have a big influence when students are choosing which path to go, some parents wants their kids to follow their steps, so they encorage their kids to take courses that would help them as they go, parents would always want the best for their kids more when its about their future.

Accomplishing a career at a young age brings many benefits, one of them is that the person not longer have to be thinking about it, takes a big weight off their shoulders, also the person would have more time for the family and especially the person would have many opportunities to find a job, because that person is young and lots of doors would be open for them.

As we see commiting a career at a young age has many advantanges the biggest one is that, the students approach their goals and advance towards their great future.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5

Students at school are getting tired eating same meal every day. If our school principle change to the healthy lunch, students at school will be so proud trying new food, but some students who have their favorite cafeteria food they might have to get their food from home or try new healthy food at school.

Students will stay healthy from eating healthy food. Eating same lunch everyday can be very dangerous in our life. Students are getting sick everyday and have to struggle with disease like food poison, vomiting, and so on. Changing school cafeteria food to healthy food can help many students stay healthy. Over the past years many people have died eating same meal everyday, and that's what we are doing here at school ""eating same lunch every single day"".

Working with groups is such a good idea because the classmates can communicate with each other , take the stress away from working alone. For example I have a lot of teachers who like to assign assignments independently and group work. It's a hassle for me to work on my own because I have a busy schedule after school. At times I dont even get to turn in my assignment when it's due. When my teacher assigns group it's way easier for me because all of my classmates will get to get a job to do with the assignment and we can work on it at school and be finished before the due date. It's also nice to go out of your confront zone and make new friends while working on assignments and an easy A.

Being in groups knowledge you to understand better by your classmate. Example one day in history we had a project to do as a group and I was completely lost on the civil war. I had to ask my classmates questions if they can help me so I can understand better and get to do the work. Sometimes teachers doesn't know how to be specific so it gets hard to understand. Seeking help from a classmate that's in your group is a good thing to do and you learn more and becomes more understandable. Not a lot of students like to work in groups because their scared they have to do the work , however; if you communicate with your classmate and assign a job it will go easy on them and get the work done quicker and easier.

It is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? Students should be commit to a career at a young age because it helps students to develop more and it allows a lot of opportunity for many students.

First, start a career at a young age it's important for students because it would helps to develop more. For example, sometimes students choose to do other stuff instead do work. Some students really want to success and get everything in life. Students would always like to have good future over everything. If students commit to a career at a young age, they would be develop in different ways. For example, students would have more stuff to do, more homework. Their mind would be thinking about stuff for their careers. They going to take things more serious for their life.

Secondly, start a career at a young age it's important for students because it allows a lot of opportunity. For example, Generic_Name was a student from Generic_school, she choose to start commit to a career when she was 17 years old. It was hard for her because she took a lot of extra classes.

To conclude, people would always say that students should no be start a career at a young age. But start at a young age would be the best choice for students in life.

I could easily write about my six years of experience in this area, and you would see that I could ""qualify"" for this visit, but I don't want you to select for those reasons; working in a TV Production company has always been my dream since I was a kid.

I was a little girl with a lot of energy, goals and really confident about myself, I enjoyed being in presentations, ceremonies or anything about being in front of the public. I kept growing, and a lot of people thought that I was going to forget about all this crazy dream to be in TV, but it wasn't like that, my interest was increasing more and more; I was still in my country, Generic_City, when I went for my first time to a news channel, the principal of my school in that moment selected me to make a commercial about a festival that we had, I'm not going to lie, I was scared and really nervous, but once I touched the microphone, I forgot all my fears, the employees of that place were so surprised, they told my teacher, ""how a 13 years old little girl can have a lot of talent? The way that she speaks make It see it so natural and easy to do it""

I would never forget those words, because It was there, when I realized, that all this was for me, ever since that one day, my principal asked me to do all the commercials for the school.

Two years later I had to move to a different school, and I had a big surprise, this school had way more opportunities to be successful in this area; the owner of the school saw my potential in the way I speak, and yes, he asked me to do every ceremony and commercials during the whole school year. But that was not enough for me, I wanted to learn more, so I stared to used professional cameras and make homemade videos to practice a little big more; that same year my family decided to move to the United States. I was really sad, no only for my family and friends, also, I didn't know If coming to America would change my dream,

everything was different, traditions, school and most important, the language. This change was not going to change what I like to do, I stared taking this class called: ""TV and Media Production"" and I felt like coming back to home, everything that I love to do, was right there, I learned how to editing videos, how to record professionally and take all I know, to a whole different level; couples moths in this country and I already had the opportunity to being in different news channels,video for the school and they loved how I did it, and I don't have to think a lot to know that this is what I want to as a career.

When someone act something they are not, they are kinda lie about how they really are, When we chose to be something we are not, It's the worse decision that we can do. But I know that every person think different to what others think. some think that act someone they are no is something better for the world. I totally disagree.

We need to stop thinking or worry what other people are going to say, we just need to worry about our self and for the people who accept how we are, with the people we can act how we really are and those people who don't judge are the best people in the world the best accomplishment a person can give is when they tell you that they accept you how you are and that we are unique, don't need to change to something we are not, that is the best accomplishment that someone can give to someone.

I don't agree with what Emerson's statement say because, we don't need to change to someone else. We can't let the world change how we are. I don't think the greastes accomplishment is to be in this world constantly trying to make us something else. The greastes accomplishment is that we show how we really are we all have something unique we need to be ourself in order to make the world better.

Being our self with someone it's kinda the best thing someone can experiment, being our self with a person is the greastes thing in the world, now and days most all the people can't be them self around other people some of them laugh at the people who act exactly how they are, some of them don't really care or pay attention to what others are doing, and I think that's how it should be. now and days we see a lot of things, people that are gay, transgender, people that are bisexual, homosexual, now we see all that for almost all the people in the world that is something normal but most of them is not. but they just acting how they really are but sometimes it can just be confusing.

Something that happened when I was 16 years old is that I had a friend that always was lying of how she really was, she used to said that she had a lot of money which wasn't true, she did have like the normal she was okay with what her parent had, she said that she was rich and all that, and because of that she make a lot of friends even that ones that were my friends stopped taking to me because i wasn't how they wanted me to be, they would tell me to go party with them, to drink, smoke and all that, my answer to all the was always no, so they stopped asking me, later on they find out that the new girl didn't have that much money as she said she had, the people who I thought that were my friends told me all that and the realize that acting something we are not is not always good being someone we are not, or telling people that we have something when is not true. We all have to be honest with each other.

That's why I always tell people be yourself no matter how hard it get, the best thing we can do it's to be our self, people need to start accepting others how they really are, Don't need to be two faces, that is how we saying now in days. Now in days most of people would wear say whatever they want,

most of the people don't care anymore they just focus on what they are doing no in what the others are doing.

I think is great idea, because some students sometime or usually work. One reason why the students do not go to the high school is because they do not have enough time to do homework, study, or just hey want to make more money.

Rarely students really want to learn, or to feel like they need to go to the college or university, cause they have a few time to go to the high school. This idea is great and amazing to someone really dream and feel that the high school is the door to the college, university, or opportunity to do your dreams real. The advantage is if you finish high school in three years you have more probability to go to the college or university. The disadvantage is that three years would be very stressing and harding time, because you need really to focus in the high school and all that stuff like: homework, worksheet, project, study, or simple attention the class. The good news is you can do anything if you have purpose, if you have motivation and completely focus in your dreams and What do you really want to be or to do?. Do not worry is you feel fear that is normal everybody feel like that about the test, high school, or dreams.

I think is a big opportunity to me; well, I work and really need pass my last year, but sometime feel like ""I cant anymore"", and I want to leave or run of the high school and just work, and work, and work, but everytime I think like that just say me "" NEVER GIVE UP "", always remember everything I did, why am i here?,and How too far wil be go for my dreams?.

Sometime the life is very unjust, cause some people have the opportunity of study withouth work, While others people do not have chooses, and that is the situation where the hispanic people live today.

Yes school should control students involvement in extracurricular activities, If they're doing terribly in school. If a student is doing terrible in school and he is in so many extracurricular activities, The School should take action right away. If the student has no time to study and involved in so many activities the student is defenitely going trough something. For example: The student's familymight be going trough rough times and he does not want to come home early, and Also he might be avoiding someone at home.

Second reason School's should control student involvement in extracurricular activities. because the Student has no time to study and the student is in so many school activities that is going to result to a bad grade. If the student has bad grades the Student is going to be stress about school and The student might ended up dropping out of school. If the student drop out of highschool it is not going to be easy for him to find a good paying job.

That is the reason why school's should take control of students involvement in extracurricular activities. If they do take control of the students with bad grades the it's in a club. They should be taken out of the club and help the student to get his grades up, and if he does he he get to join the club. Every students should earn it by having good grades.

We gonna ruin their life indirectly. So that we should teach them about career and guide they to the right way . We love our student that's why we should support they to have a better life in the future. That's all of my opinion. I hope we don't make any mistake because everyone deserve a happy life.

I would really like to go to collage to study about how to be a lawyer but before i can make it to collage, it's very important for me to make sure i'm doing good in school and also making sure my grades are good, i am hoping to graduate high school with being top of my classes. I want to show people that with trying your hardest, you can sussed in life. I would be the first in my family to make it to collage.

I have to make sure I am doing all my school work, making sure i get to school on time. also something thats very important is keeping your life profile clean. staying out of trouble is very important, something collages well look at is grades and your background life. a collage wouldn't want someone who has bad grades, someone who is always getting into trouble or someone who just doesn't care bout anything. They look for people who are trying their hardest to be someone in life. going to collage means you want to try hardest so you can be someone in life. collages teach you everything on what you want to be. they help you make your dreams come true.

3. Something i'm also looking forward is to learn on how people do their job. i want to learn how they speak up for the person who they are helping out, how do they know what to say, is it scary? i have so much questions t ask. my goal is to be someone who can help people out, who everyone comes for when they need help. i would like to make people happy but right now my goals are to make sure i finish school. i have to work hard to keep my grades good and also make sure i stay out of trouble.

tudents should not be allowed to graduate of high school a year early, as this will cause students to only have a lack of free a time and enjoyment of being of high school.

These student will have to take rigorous courses during the summertime vacation and late into the evening.

These students will miss out on taking electives, as well as missing out on valuable high school experience by being forced to grow up a year

Some high school offer students the option to graduate in three years. However, allowing a three years school programs would result students taking extra classes in summer and and at night. As results would no larger be an idea on summer for the students. In they are working throughout with no mental or physical causing more stress and responsibilities such as extra homework and getting to night. In order to get classes during nighttime, students would have a transportation to and school. Driving to school would in students spending money and increase price of gas. School also have to spend money pay teacher for extra hours after school. Another common problem would be teacher will want to work after school will would result in the hiring of teachers.

Working with someone else can bring many benefits and opportunities to everyone, but there is many people who prefer to work by their self . working in a group can help to have done everything on time, and we can establish a good environment in the classroom. Each person have different opinions, and we have to respect it.

Working in groups help to have everything done on time, since we are gathering many types of ideas and information from everyone. For example, in USA there are a diversity of people from different parts around the world, and each person have a different opinions and ideas in how they see everything. However, some people think that they have better opinions about what they are doing than others, but an opinion or idea is just a help that can guide to the best option. Having groups in classes is a help that can benefit. Because, they are helping each other. When someone is working alone can be struggling and do not ask for any type of help to keep going and make things nicely.

When we are working in groups, we can establish a good environment with our classmates, since there is a lot of communication between classmates. For example, if we work alone, we would not be able to communicate each other, because, everyone is concentrate in what are they doing. Otherwise, people from different parts of the country would not have the opportunities to meet each other and learn different cultures from their classmates. Knowing each other can create a calm and gradable place to stay and share with every student in the classroom. Even other students would prefer to be there.

Many people would like to be in a place where they can share and work together.

F2B390040C12,"My school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours, and four day school week. There are some benefits but also disadvantages.

First reason, if we take only two hours of class during the day probable should more express try the best of us, for use that time of class. In contrast, lose hours in others things not necessary; with more hours and days off the students would be distract of the responsability that is demanding the school.

second reason, less pressure for the students that have a job is a big idea taking the school day two hours, because they want time for both during the week. For example, i work 27 hours in three day i came home so late, hungry, and tired sometimes i miss days of school, for that reason i think is benefit take time on sleep then came to the school just for few hours. But, one disadvantages that could be happent is less time of classes when the students don't work or spend time in others distraction. Clearly, they feel more in liberty in do something else on free time, and would not put all in the study.

Third reason, another disadvantages is not focus at all maybe should not work that idea; in the way that lost time of school is lost sacred time. The teachers miss day of their job too, and the student do not see the loss of the oportunity that is the school. However, one benefit and important for the students is the repose, so when our brain is in repose with not too much pressure it was relax, and we going to be blessed. Because, we have more time to think much better what we want to do for our future,so we think most clear.

In conclusion, in my opinion it is a great idea if my school take a four day school week of two hours each day. Obviously, it's probable that students feel more easy in this way, for making their homework with time, wisdom, and decoration.

My first reason is it keeps you away from boredom. It keeps you away from starring at a wall for hours. And it keeps you away from sleeping in a class room. Its more helpful having someone to raise and boost your energy and being the confident person you are. Now days in a classroom were haveing 60 percentr on students being unsure about there answers and being unsure if they should even speak up. Being in a group helps you raise your voice. Manny Adult and students are suffering boredom and thats not healthy. Talking to your peers and being around people more keeps you away from depression. Making your self feel more confident about yourself shows who you really are its like the next step to being a risk taker. My second reason is you can talk and discuss with your group about your project or work together. Its more faster being in a group where you can actually discuss about your thoughts and idea and feeling more confident than ever. Having a partner check it look togerther for any mistake or errors. My final reason is you save lots of time for yourself. And not everyone is right. But creating these ideas from yourself and your group could make something turn out to be unthinkable. Being in a group makes your mind grow and learn new things and ideas from other people. Your having a good time with your friends and if not you meet new people that may become friends with you. You want to talk and move around and meet new people getting out. Not being shy or denying yourself wrong. Being in a group is like your bring peace in a table. I belive that everyone should try new things being in a groups and its okay if your wrong because there is no right answer.

First. People need to believe in themselves and do what they think that it is right. Sometime we are afraid to make ours onw decision because we think that is wrong or because what others can think about us. But just think about, all the things that people had been invented along the time. What would will happend if they did not make their onw decisions, nothing that what we have today will not exist. So do not be afraid to make your onw decisions because others. Is not bad to look what other had been done and see if what you are about to do can be good or not. But always follow your ideas and do your onw work.

The instincts is a natural aptitude that human have, is something that make us do things without a well reason. The instincts make us do things that we think are right because a felling that we felt. No matter, sometime that felling can be rigth or not. But sometime bad decisions teach us what we do wrong and learned how do it better in a future. people should follow their instincts and ideas because that is what make us defferent. Learn of what we do wrong make us a better person. Poeple always are going to judge you and talk about your decisions no matter if are good or bad. So do not let others stop you and doing the things that you believe are right.

The decisions that we make today can harm us in the future. That may be is right, but if we always are thinking about what is going to happend. we never are going to know what is really going to happend. So make own ours decisions can make a big change ir our life for good or bad. It is important to listen to experts because can be helpful in what you are abuot to do.

As we know, technology has became one of the most important things in our lives, and people now are abusing the use of technology and forgetting to contact with the others around them. Although it has both positive and negative affects on people, but we cannot declaim that our lives have been easier and better since we have had techonlogy.

First, technology are used everyday by people at all ages because of its functions. We can complete many things online by using technology such as study, entertain, shopping, etc. For example, students use technology to serve for their learning like stuyding online or researching important things for their lessons. Lots of people also use it to play game, chat with their friends, or shopping online to relax after a hard-working day.

With technology, we can find and do almost things we need so we can save our times and will have more times to do the other activities like spending time with family, or hanging out with friends.

Second, technology helps us adpot hot problems, new informations of society faster and easier. We can read news on the websites, or watch the agenda to update more things everyday so we can have better knowlegde about things around us. Besides, many poor people have been helped by the others because the news about them have been shared wide-spread. This showed the major of technology and the care of people give to the others.

Many people said the use of technology has the limitation of human contact, and it's not all right. We can easily contact to the others by texting, calling as technology is developing . Using technology in general and social media in particular also can help us make friends. People often use Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat to add friends over the world and follow them. It is a best way to know our friends, family members' activities without asking because we don't have too much time to speak with them everyday. Otherwises, we still have to speak face to face to the others as much as possible so we can understand them better, and it also shows our care to them.

Not only technology, everything in the world also has both positive and negative sides, and the main idea is ourselves. If we use technology for the right purposes, and can limit the time of using it, technology will be very useful to our lives. In short, technology can limit human contact or not based on us so let's try using it as limited as we can and don't forget to use it right ways, right times, and right purposes.",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5

That was the reason how I understood how to answer the questions on the quiz.

My science teacher then told me that I could stay after school and go to the homework club with her to practice on the parts of a cell.

One week later my grade went up to a B because my teacher helped me pass my test.

F610B3CBF3DF,"Winston Churchill once said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", Meaning success can only be achieved by having few mistakes along the way. Many believe achieving success means doing everything perfect and not making one single mistake, having a couple of mistakes doesn't mean failure it means progress to be successful because one can learn from the mistakes that are made and helps improve to achieve something better.

To be successful, there will be some mistakes in the journey but when those mistakes are made learning from them is the best way to accomplish your goal. For example, when one is constructing a house but have little knowledge on construction, the one building the house will mess up and fail at times but the best way to finish something is to learn from what went wrong. To clarify, to accomplish a certain goal, learning from the mistakes along the journey is the best way to do it. Not only learning from mistakes help be successful but it also helps improve one another.

Improvement is a big key in success. Failure will always have a role in success but it happens to help improve to become or do something better. For example, famous altheles in sports make mistakes in games all the time, but from the failures in the past, pro altheles train to improve more to become better and to not make the same mistakes again. In other words, failure may be the worse but it's a way to show what to improve. From mistakes made in the past one will become better or do better than expected.

Having a couple of mistakes doesn't mean failure it means progress to be successful.

Elementary school students learn way more when someone is teaching them a lesson instead of the kids learning it by there self. Teaching kids a lesson in school or out of school is not a bad thing to do because kids and others can learn anything out of school walls, once they start go grow up they will understand what they have learn and what not have learn in elementary school, and of the hard effort the kids have put into there work in school and at home.

Why is giving a lesson to elementary schools important ? I feel like it is important because your teaching them something they have not learned or know about what they will be learning about yet, teaching younger kids can be really nice and all, but some of these kids can be very hard to take care of and handle like upper up classes/grades.

When giving a lesson to a class can be difficult and all that, but it can also be fun to teach them some cool things they should know about and teach them easy work so they can understand the work faster and so they can see what level or understatement they are at, kids that go to elementary school can be way easier and faster to teach because upper grade level can get hard and exhausted, cause of there beavers and they way they love to act in front of other people which, they shouldnt be acting like that. Younger students know better then not to behave really bad and act crazy, thats why i think it is important to teach younger kids then older kids, younger students they well ,they know what they are doing, also understand of the the work we teach them but we always got to teach them very well and help them with the lesson we have given and show how it is done and how to do it with out being upset.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5

I believe, when most of the people don't understand how relevant is to do something instead of being inactivity that also serve purpose because like everybody else it is normal to always do or make good things for someone, and it could be family or close friends for example.

My reason is if we try to done good stuff for people, and not receiving anything back for example: If I give people chance to not try anything, then how are we gonna communicate? how are we going to accomplish our goal when you don't deserve it? so my point and my reason is the we need to do something about not being inactivity with people are around you. I understand that not everyone are gonna have the same thoughts as me or with other person. However we need to be on the side to the change for good.

I grew up knowing when people put a lot of their afford to you, it means a lot because you'll never know when people will trust you and believe in you again it's a huge difference between those, and we people show us or make us see how important is when almost everything is easy when we ask for it example: Trying to hard to show how many things you have done for that person without asking, but it means a lot to you because you give a lot to that person and you hope that person can give you the same thing you've done for her or him.

Sometimes some people misunderstood about always doing something for her or him like you don't have to do it for them, but believe you'll feel great if someone do something for you isn't a bad thing then you will be fine and grateful knowing that theres good people around you, and ready for help you. You ain't alone anymore believe theres people for you and try to not think too much about it.

My conclusion is about to always do something for people because there is people who will need you, and being around, and everything you want to do for them it will make it better like.

F6C88F801A8A,"I would have to disagree to this statements. Letting be controlled by the world

(people)

it's not a good idea. There is so many things to accomplish, by not being controlled by other people. We can so many things without people controlling us, we can succeed our life. We can actually be someone though our hard work and deduction.

being us:

just being who you are would be the best and great choice to do. You would think properly with correct knowledge, just by doing that, You would accomplish so many things in life without people going agents you. NOT being you or being someone you really not are, is not a good idea.

Don't let them control you:

letting people control who you are, isn't a good thing. Many people think is a good thing because they can fame or attention, Its like having a double life, 1: living the regular life, being who you really are, 2: Being out in public pretending to be someone when your not. You won't accomplish the things you want to do when your not yourself. You will feel important when the world wants you be someone. Be yourself and accomplish the things you want to do and you will improve your skills and achivments. They will just control your life and they won't help you on the long run. No one can control someones life who they want them to be.

being us, not them:

We need let people do what they want we shouldn't be controlling their life. Everyone should chose there who they want to be and what to do. Not everyone should be controlling them. Not everyone are they same, they are different from others. They don't know their weaknesses to be telling them to be.

We shouldn't be controlling other people what to become. Many people do it for the fame and attention but they are the most unsuscceful people. They dont achieve things they go by there fame and people. We should be us and not be someone we cant be. They end up being embarrassed.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5

One of the reasons i would not want them to add an hour to school is because if they add an hour to school they would have to add class to the chool to. but one of the main resons that i would not want another hour at school is becuase kids just want to go home and adding an hour would just get kids and parents mad for there kids getting home late.

For example if it was day light savings time it would be very dark once every one to go home. Or if a teacher staff memeber or student plays a sport they would be late or unbkle to go for the late releas at the school. In addition if there where to be a lockdown at that hour and a half that the school bored had added the parents of the students might want to sue the school bored for putting there children in danger at the time they added to the day.

First, my cousin was going through a bad path last year when he was a freshman in high school. He would always come home late at night. He always had his mother worried about him. Next, there was this one night where she was so worried, she had to call the police because she thought something bad happened to him. When my mom told me about the situation, I never looked up to it, never imagined myself doing that. In addition, he would barely answer his mothers phone calls. She was devastated seeing her son go through a bad path. One day she was done with the things he did, so she decided to take him to Generic_City with my 37 year old cousin. He spent about 2 weeks in Generic_City so that he would think about his bad choices. When he came back, his mother decided to move to another house and another school for him. Finally, things are so much better now. His grades are much better now, he doesn't go out to late at night anymore, and his mom is peacefully working.

My cousin is doing good choices now. First, he is not in bad paths anymore thanks to his mother. Recently, he has been working out and eating healthy. Every Saturdays and Sundays morning, he goes to the gym with this older sister that is 21 years old. Next, he gets home he eats a bowl of sugar free oatmeal with sliced strawberries and blueberries. I know for sure that he wants to be a new and better person. Last year when he was a freshman, he would skip a lot of school days. His mother would get phone calls of him absent. But, he is putting a lot of effort into school. Over the summer, my dad decided to take him to work with him. My cousin helped him out with construction tools. They both worked for about 7 hours that day. A few days later, my dad had to meet up with his boss and other co-workers to earn the money. Lastly, my dad, siblings and I drove to his house to not only drop off the 80 dollars he earned, but also see how him and his family were doing.

I never experienced this, and I know that I never will. Seeing the suffer in his mom was terrifying. I would never want my mother to suffer the way his mother did. Think about the good choices and how it will bring joy into your life. I would be very lost to see myself into his bad choices.

Another reasons why I disagree is because student might not like school and it can get boring. Something else why I disagree is because parents might want you after school for something and if you come from school late them can't do what your parents are telling u want to do.

Some reasons why I disagree is because you might have to do thing after school. Something are you might have sports practice for a team or for clubs. Another reason why is because some students have family things to do out of school and it would be for a long time. Some student would have doctor appoints and that is very important.

Another reasons why I disagree is because student will get bored in school. Some student can start to get mad try to leave the school and get in trouble and the student can get in a fight. Something else is that student can fall asleep and not pay attention to the teachers and they can get trouble as well as the student can stay even longer. Something is that they would not be able to learn if they fall asleep.

Last reasons why I disagree is because parents might need their child after school for something. There parents might need them to help clean them clean there house. If they need to tell them something important. Another reason why is because there parents might need help to buy food for there house. Some parents might not like that because they would not be able to see there child for a long time.

That why I disagree because school is just for certain time it not all day. Some student will get bored and not want to come school again. They might have thing to do after school like sports and practices or other thing. Some student parent might need help from there child and would want to see them more time not for a little while.

F89738650EDF,"Self-esteem comes from achievement. My reason for saying this is because you shouldn't be getting praised for a low assignment that they did; then they are not going to grow. My other reason was that teachers are here to help students improve and if the student know they didn't the best they could've and get praised for it; then they're going to think that they don't have to do that much and will have a low self-esteem.

To elaborate more on my first reason for why I say self-esteem comes from achievement is because if you do excellent on a paper and are positively sure you did amazing then you should be getting praised. That shows how much a student can have a high self-esteem for themselves. Even though, the paper probably wasn't easy that person didn't get lazy. They wanted to do better which means that they want to grow and improve not just stay where they are.

I am going to explain my second reason for why self-esteem comes from achievement. This is all about the students and how they improve. Therefore, if a student knows they could've done better on an assignment and get praised for the lazy work that did then they are going out think that they don't need to do that much work anymore. Although, as the teacher; they shouldn't be praising students on lazy work. They should pull them aside and say "" hey this was good but it wasn't you best work; I know you can do better"".

My counterclaim is teachers shouldn't let students get away with lazy work. I say this because sometimes some students might think that the teachers don't pay attention to them or they don't care about their work. Even though, if the student approaches the teacher with a problem then the teacher will remember you and know to check up on you when it comes to your work.

In conclusion, true self-esteem does not come from praise on an effortless assignment. If you praise students on a low assignment then that's the level they are going to stay at because they got praised to be lazy. Which means that the teacher leaves the student not wanting to improve and expand on their writing skills.

If managers give students the opportunity to visit their occupations,students who work hard won't lose that excellent opportunity,and managers would have an amazing great roll in students achievement which I know it would help the company. Although some say that companies should not give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because if the company that I went to visit doesn't have that much of of opportunities for me to discover,whether I'm interested in what they have,and I may be disappointed ,and probably I would have in mind to talk bad about the company that they don't have sufficient knowledge or information,actually companies should give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because I would have a great experience of the excellent opportunities that they may have,and I as a student I will have the experience to explore and get some knowledge at a young age of the opportunities that I can be able to get if I prepare to have a amazing future.

Companies should give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because I would have a great experience of the excellent opportunities that they may have,for example,my mother always tells me a story about how she became a lawyer,she said that as a student,she was preparing herself for the future,thanks to school,they gave her a chance to explore and get some knowledge about lawyers in a company called ""Everything is possible,if you believe it""she had the chance as a lawyer to meet the president,also there is a story about her in the internet,she became a lawyer because she had the opportunity.

I as a student I will have the experience to explore and get some knowledge at a young age of the opportunities that I can be able to get if I prepare to have a amazing future for example,I read about an incredible woman who know is a professional chemistry teacher ,in the story gave details about how she became who she is it doesn't specific which company she went to learn about her career,but the point is that she has an excellent job,because she got prepare for it.

In vacation many students go for a trip with family or with friends. In school days students are waiting for vacation but when they have vacation they miss there school friends. Students need break for 4 to 5 weeks to enjoy there vacation.

Some educators students feel that the summer break is too long and they think when they return to school they cannot catch up easily. They said we have a holiday in year-round means only 1 times in a year. It should be only for 3 to 4 weeks as long as a winter break.

I did not agree with the educators students because students have aslo there life. Ther need to enjoy it make a fun and they also have dreams for their life. Educators students cannot decided others life. If they needs short break then they after 3 to 4 weeks they start study at home and fweel like they are doing their school works. Educators did not like long break because in schoolthey always study and at home also. Long break for educators student is like a death. Educators student cannot enjoy their vacation properly because they alway think about there study. I think in vacations all students cannot think about the study. They need to enjoy their vacation . Educators students also have their life and they need to enjoy it properly had a fun, spend time with with famil or friends. Go gor a long trip and refresh there mind. After all that they can start from begining for their study. They get better ideas for study. They study properly without tension.

I suggest educators students and normal students go togather because educators students also have an idea how to enjoy it make it fun and where they want to go. In summer vacation students may go beach, park, sunshine point and enjoy it. In summer vacation students may enjoy ever single movement because it can be there memories.

After then they finish there schools they can missed tht evey single movement that they had a lot of fun on it. They miss theirfiends whom they enjoy. They miss there school.

FBE8983EF69C,"Have you ever participated in a extracurricular activity at school, Did you enjoy it? In today's day and age there are tons of extracurricular activities and even maybe some you never heard about. Its always nice to give something a try even if you have never done it before. You could even join something that you have already done before and that your good at. For example, if you are good at basketball you could join the basketball club and have fun doing what you like. I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can gain new experiences, it could help with their health, and they can make new friends.

My first reason that students should participate in extracurricular activities is that they gain new experiences. Its always nice to try something that you've never done before. For example, lets say you have no experience in cooking and theres a cooking club you can join. By joining that club you could learn about different foods and how to cook them. Those cooking skills that you learned could take you a long way or help you with something simple like cooking you or somebody else some food at home. Another example could be joining a club that has to do with the wild and things like nature. You could learn about things like how to make a fire or what plants are dangerous and which are not. There could even be some hands on experiences like fields trips to go camping or just explore the wilderness. These could help you if you ever wanted to go camping on your own later on in the future. These are just some of the things you would get to experience joining new clubs,there are so many more.

My second reason that students should join extracurricular activities is that it could help with their health. If students join a club they will be surrounded by other students and this will help them stay socially active. Instead of being at home in a dark room playing video game or on their phones, they could be talking other students and enjoying the activities in the club. Its always nice to have people surrounding so that way your not alone. Being alone could lead to things like depression or social anxiety and no student should have to go through any of those things. Another way it could help with their health is by joining a sports club. By joining any sports club students will be getting at least forty minutes to a hour of daily exercise. This exercise that the students are getting could help them with things like weight loss or just trying to stay in shape. Its always good to try and maintain good health and these are some great ways to do it.

My third and final reason that students should participate in extracurricular activities is that they can make new friends. By joining these extracurricular activities students may meet other students they have never seen before. This could be a opportunity for them to be able to make new friends. On top of that, they could most likely have the same interests as they chose the same club or activity. For example if they joined soccer they may have a interest in soccer and they could build off of that. Once they become friends they could do things like help each other in school or maybe even hang out. They could even introduce each other to other friends that they have. For example, One student could ask the friend he made in the Art club if he wanted to sit with him during lunch and now that the student has been introduced and they can all be friends now. Making friends is always a good and fun thing to do.

Overall, extracurricular activities are a good thing for students. Whether its if your making friends, helping out your health, or even learning new experiences. Extracurricular activites are a big help to students. They should be encouraged to join and try them. I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they gain new experiences, it could help with their health, and they can make new friends.",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0

If the teacher do not have the time because she is helping others student to help a group member they can support each other. And the student have different ways to do the work so they can help each other to finish the work more faster. In conclusion the Students should work in group because they are going to receive more help.

Student should work in group because the student are going to prepare for the future. For example when they get out of school, and they have to work in a office with a group of people they are going to have the experience to share ideas and get and give support. When the student have a family they are going to support each other with the family member to solve any problem that they have in the way. In conclusion the Students should work in group because the student are going to prepare for the future.

Student should work alone because they are going to their work independence, however; It is better to work in group because students can help each other.

In conclusion for me the student in the school should working in group because they are going to have more ideas, more help and, they can prepare their self to the future.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0
FC831CB27E25,"Although some people might say, if the students choosed a specific career at a young age it will help them to focus on their future. Choosing career at young age would make the student stressful, because the student will feel scare of failing in what he choosed, he dont have close people are supporting him for what he want, he choosed a career he doesn't want it because of few members of his family want him to be what they want not like as he want to choose. Having a specific career while being young student would make the student more responsible and creative of what he is going to do for his life with full of confidence, because in growing up more hard decisions the student will have so he has to choose the right decision, being creative at his career will let the student get a big succeed, and being already chosen a career is enough by itself to stay away of the people who failed in their life because they dont have a goal or career they can get.

In conclusion, choosing career at young age would make the student stressful, having specific career while being young student would make the student more responsible and creative of what he is going to do for his life with full of confidence, the student won't be worry if he is going to choose his passion, let the student take what he think its good for hisself.",2.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5
FC9DA73D1EA0,"Even in classroom everything catch student's attention!

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

I strongly believe that there is no benefits from attending to classes from home. Next I am going to illustrate three reasons for saying that. First, by taking online classes at the end of the semester students do not learn anything. Second, students most of the time get distract very easily, they don't focus on what they are suppose to be focusing on. Last , is more convenient when someone is teaching you literally face to face.

To begin with, sometimes students don't learn anything in classroom imagine in front of a computer.

In other words, being at home students will do everything in a rush just to finish it quickly and go do something else. Another consequence is that they will not put any interest in the classes and later, when the time to show your knowledge comes, they will not know what to do.

For Example, in my case when I am learning something something in the computer I feel like the light of the computer blocks my mind.

To continue, is very easily for students to get distracted by something. Taking online classes at home means having access to any electronic device to distract them like, cell phones, same computer that you are using, TV, etc. For example, sometimes when your family sees you at home they will tell you to take care of your siblings; the student will have to be supervising the kids and not focusing enough in the classes. imagine that in the classroom friends distract students at home that will be more terrible because young students always have friends playing video games at their home.

At last, is more convenient to be learning in a classroom where you can see the teacher. For example, In my case I like to interact with the teacher and my classmate about the topic that we are learning, to get better understanding and sometimes to get other viewpoints. Therefore, is more efficiently to be seeing the teacher literally teaching you to get all the knowledge needed to pass the classes. Most of the time that students are learning somethings in the computer they tend to forget it right away.

In conclusion, being in a classroom and interacting with the teacher and classmate is the best way of learning, getting all the information needed to pass the classes. By taking online classes at home the only thing that is going to happen is losing the semester by not being able to score what is needed to pass.

Electronic distraction is more available at home and get students attention very easily.

Attending to a classroom is more convenient and better way of learning and get educated the way it should be. It is not just about classes but also how to interact with people and and everything that is needed outside in the world to be educated and successful in life.  ",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5

FCF714354720,"We will never learn and grow until we try things we never did. Trying new things would lead us to grow and gain experience. Everyone should improve themselves in order to grow. We must learn about different things other than what we already know to gain knowledge and experience. People that have dreams and want to accomplish should work on trying new experience, learning new things, and improving themselves.

Trying new things is the key to gain experience. Soccer players do not always play only soccer. For example, they try different sports to learn more about them. Teachers always try to come up with new topics to teach their students and help them gain more knowledge. Buisnessman always work on improving their buisness to grow and become better. To gain more experience we should try different things.

To learn things we never knew about we should work hard. Soccer player work really hard to become the best. They do that by learning new skills from big players. Also, teachers try to learn new languages to be able to teach their students who does not speak English very well. Kids should learn from their parents the good things so when they grow up they would have a lot of experience that they learned. We must learn new things to become successful.

We must improve ourselves to become successful. Bodybuilders always work on improving their body and getting big. However, parents try to improve, and change the way they treat their kids with to be able to teach them good things. People that just moved to the U.S.A should work on improving their English to be able to talk with everyone. To become successful we should improve ourselves.

In order to accomplish our dreams we should work on trying new things, learn things we never knew about, and improving ourselves. Engneers try to come up with new ideas to build better buildings.

FD7DC289E98E,"Many students involve themselves in a lot of school activities to enrich their educational experience, some Students can also learn responsibility, because the students can choose how many activities they would like to do.

The students could also feel more mature by having to talk with their parents to do any activity after school. Students also have the opportunity to make lots of friends by joining clubs or doing sports.

Although if the school controlled the students involvement of doing any activity, the students would have a limit of joining a certain amount of activities after school. That could help the student not stress about all the responsibility they would have to do. The school also makes students have good grades in other to join a club or sport, which helps the students focus on school assignments first. However letting the school control a student, would make the student struggle with responsibility and communication with people.

If a student wants to play a sport and be in a club after school because the student wants to make friends, they shouldn't be limited to joining just one by the school. Instead the student should be allowed to choice and join as many clubs or sports they would like. It would help the student to communicate with people without them being scared or shy to talk to someone. Going out of their comfort zone early would also help a student with finding and working for a job. Communication is one of the most important things in a daily life, and if a student can't join an activity because of their grades, how would the student be able to talk to someone if their scared too.

Joining a lot of activities after school, helps a student with responsibility. When a student is involved in a lot of activities, they learns to use their time wisely and would help them later in life for when they are working. It would also help with daily events like taking out the trash, washing their dishes, cleaning their room, and doing their school assignments. Since they have to be doing well in school to even be doing after school activities. Responsibility is something a student should learn in a early age, and should have during school and after they graduate from high school and even collage.

If a student is committed to doing all the activities they chose to have, they will do great. Not only will they feel good about themselves, but that will make their parents proud and show them that they ready to be independent. That would also look good for when the student signs up for a collage they would like to go to, but also for when they get a job. When someone is committed to their job, their boss will notice that they really wanna work and could even get a raise. Commitment will help a student, because if they believe they can do a lot of school work and do lots of activities, They will feel great about themselves at the end of their high school career.

FDC94E0FE9C8,"Have you ever did something because is on trend or just because someone else did?. As you must know humans are easily influenced by others way of thinking and acting and it is because we want other people to like us showing that humans are social individuals. The best way of influencing others is setting an example by ourselves because we tend to compare ourselves to other people, also humans repeat what they like like the fashion trends, and lastly, because social pressure can lead us to do things even if we don't want to just because everyone else did.

Everyone is influenced by what others thinks or do.

First, we have to begin with the way in which we usually compare ourselves to other people. Is common that if we see someone breaking the rules we'll claim that ""We are on our right to do it to"" . Or we can just see that this happens a lot between siblings; if one of the siblings gets something the other one will want the same. For example, when my parents buy something for my brother, I want them to buy something for me to. Or when they let my brother be out until a late hour, I'll claim that I have the right to do the same the next time I go out. People is always comparing themselves to others in what they have or don't have.

Next, is imperative to analyze the humans dependence in wearing what others wear just because is in trend. If for example Gigi Hadid wears sweat pants with heals and looks good, every girl in the world would run to buy the same clothes and wear them because now is a trend; or if a girl in my school wears makeup in some way and I liked how it looked, I'll copy the look and wear it some other day. Humans like parrots repeat what they like.

Finally, the social pressure can make us do things we don't want to just because someone else did. That is why many times we've heard "" If other people jumped from the bridge, Will you do it to?"". For example if we are on a party and someone offers a drink, the probability of drinking it is high because everyone else is doing it, and we want people to like us. If someone challenges us, we would do it because we want people to like us. Social pressure is an influence in what people do.

In conclusion, Setting an example on our own will help us a lot in making people do what we want them to do. A smile is contagious, kindness is contagious and humans as social individuals repeat what they like and humans want people to like them.",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5
FDE0B653AD74,"When you play activities or an instrument, don't you get a relief when you play them?

I like to play volleyball, because I can make new friends, it gives me an opportunity in life to have a good life, and it is really fun to hit the ball when it flies really close to you.

My first reason is that I can make new friends. Having friends is an amazing thing, because you can always rely on your friend and have some kind of connection to them. Friends will help you at any time, whether it is hard times, bad grades, fight with someone, arguments and others. Friends are always there for you and it does not need to be a daily conversation with them to be friends. If you have friends, you will have more success in your life and it will give you new opportunities in life, such as, jobs and etc. When you become friends with someone, you become a different person and everyone around you are happy and you also can make a difference in the world if you have more opportunities to have a great life.

My second reason is that the games give me more opportunities to participate in any activities that I am interested in. Doing activities is good, because it keeps you healthy and a more enjoyable person. When you play sports it teaches you math, because the ball is circular and it has a circumference, radius, and a diameter. People don't just play sports, they play sports, because they enjoy them and when you play it, it feels like that you are free and able to do anything in the world. When you believe you can do it, you will be able to do it, you just don't need to give up if something goes wrong.

My third reason is that it is fun to hit the ball when it flies towards you. It is fun, because it give you new experiences and different feelings that you have never had felt before. But to play a sport you have to have good grades and a good spirit of wanting to play the game. Sports are like your new life, because when you start playing, you cannot stop. It feels like you are addicted to the game and that it is so fun that you cannot stop playing it. When you are in a team, it gives a different feeling, because you have to work hard to get into the team. You don't just go and play a sport, it has to include how hard enough you have worked to play in that sport.

My fourth reason is that you should never give up on any sport, if you already started it. Sports also give a different point of view of people. Having feelings is a really good experience, because it shows a whole different part of our personality. Sports give you a life experience that you will never forget, even if you are old. And, whenever you feel along you can go talk to your teammates about it and they will help you out with it. Teammates are the best part of the game, because they open so many new doors to you and you just have to work hard enough that you can go through the doors that you chose to live with.

My final reason is that even perfect people make mistakes in games. If you want to be perfect in a game, you just have to practice a lot to become better and better at it. Practicing show your teammates that you care about them and the game. New friends always pop out from different angles in your life. Life without friends would be miserable, because you have nobody to help you in anything.

Playing volleyball is really important to me , because I can make new friends it is really fun to hit the ball when it comes towards you, and give opportunities for a new and better life.

In conclusion, sports are really fun, because you can always gain courage in the game. You can experience things you never experienced before. It can make you want to become a coach, because if you are a coach it will be fun to give kids what they want to play and get new ideas of new kinds of games that they can play. Your life doesn't always depend on the game, because we always have something else to do even if we have a game and it is always hard to find what time you are going to play the game. It is how the life will be when you are a grown up. Our lives always give us surprises that we don't expect. Sports are the most important thing in our lives, because they helps us overcome our fears of communicating with people.",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5
FDFB04ED3388,"I agree with John Lubbock statement about ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it""

because in order for you to get to your career , you want to have very good character traits. For an example , you love working with kids , so you apply working at a daycare center where you'll teach little kids the different types of shapes and watch them while their parents are at work. You apply and get schedule for an interview and the owner in charge looks over your resume and realizes you have bad character traits , do you think that they'll give you the job ? no they wont because they want someone who has good character traits.

Another reason , Your character shouldnt be decided by the world or your friends. Your character is something you show to somebody like loyalty and respect. If your loyal to someone chances are they'll be loyal to you. For an example a Hospital hires you to be a general surgeon most likely they want you to stay loyal to them and stay with them. Respect goes a long way , respecting someone is very important you never want to get in someones bad side because you never know what they'll do if you disrespect them. You want to always respect someone.

Your character is something that is chosen by yourself never the world, because you could be a very good person and you'll still have people talking down on you , but you choose to accept the fact that people are always going to have their own opinion. The world shouldnt decided if your a good person or a bad person society shouldnt decide that either. You choose to either be mean , rude , nice , happy , or sad. Your character shouldnt be based on the people around you. They shouldnt have to choose your attitude.

Even though people think that your character is formed by influences beyond our control , I think we control our own character , we choose to either to be mean or nice. We control what goes through our head and what comes out of our mouths. The people around us should respect our character. We decided what we want to do for ourselves not others.

The proposal of increase the school day two hours has the pros and the cons. I'm against of extending the school day. I know the pro is that way we save more energy and resources but has more cons, to continue I have three clear reasons.

The students to lost one day complete of class, and they needs to learn more of each class material. I think that if the teens study just four-day per week, they will can't to be a good output academic. I have a friend that she studies in another school, her school is not ""common"", And you ask me: ""Why do you tell me ""not common""?"" I can answer you because the school day is similar to the principal question, she study just Monday to Thursday; She told me that is ""cool"" because don't have class on Friday but I think that was ridiculous, I know is funny don't to be class on Friday, is really funny!! but We are need focus in to study, we need to have a purpose that is the school and graduate. Studying four-day to week is not similar than study five-day to week.

Some students have a job after school, if they study two hours more per day to week, so the teen would not to be to work almost per four days. They need to work for pay their phones, their clothes, their rent, their food, etc. My cousin have a job after school , he works 5 or 4 days to week. He works because he need the money. When the class is to finish (He can to work that days), his job's schedule start 4:30pm to 10:30pm, so if the school decide change or increase the two hours per day, my cousin and other teens that have a job, would not to work.

The students need more time after school in their home, because they can to do homework or study any quiz or class materials, even any teens have another class in the afternoon, like to study computer, French, Spanish, Arabic, or whatever language , also study arts, math, ballet or whatever dance that they to prefer. Patty is 15 years old, she is a cute girl, she loves to dance class, her dance class start 5pm to 7pm, her schedule is on Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday she takes computer and Spanish class the same time that dance class. If the school decide follow this model by extending the school day two hours probably she lost her afternoon class

In conclusion, I think that should not follow the model be extending the school day two hours, because the students lost one day complete of class,lost the concentration and focusing in the class,

would no to get job after school and they would not to study another class after school. ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.5

I agree with what the scientist

Albert Einstein said the imagination is more important than knowledge because you can have more fun, and you can discover a lot of new things, also you can enjoy life more.

To begin with you can have more fun because you can be really entertained while creating new things like when you start a new project you can have a lot of ideas, and you can enjoy explaining them, or drawing them, you can have fun too when you are making those ideas come to life because you imagine them just how you want them, and you can have fun too by learning in the process something like you may not know, and you can apply them on your project just by using your imagination because you are the only one who knows how you want it.

Also you can discover new thing maybe you would not Know is the thing that you are creating could work, and there you can discover a lot of ways to work more well, or you can also discover, and learn more thing like what to use, or how to put thing right, but thats not the only thing, for what you can use your imagination for, you also can use it when you are drawing or writing histories like when you write you can discover a lot of knew words, or when you are drawing you can discover where you can put lines in the right spot, or at what measure, you also can discover how well you can draw.

Finally you can enjoy life more because you would not be so stressful, and you can enjoy imagine, and in my thoughts when you imagine you are in your own world you can imagine what ever you want, and you would not be worry about what the people is going to say about you I think I'm an example of it because I like to draw a lot and when I'm thinking about what I want to draw I always forget about everything, and I really enjoy drawing, and I also like to go out a lot because of that because when I go out I see a lot of thing and when I want to draw I always imagine them, and then I draw them more colorful than how I saw them and I really enjoy it.

In conclusion imagination is more important than knowledge you can have knowledge but if you don't have imagination you won't see life the same because when you imagine you can have more fun, see life different, and you can discover a branch of new thing you wold see life more colorful, and you can also enjoy life more how I already say you can have knowledge, and you can have and do a lot of things with it but if you have imagination you can have the whole world just by imagining.",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5

Everyone has seen marching bands doing all types of exciting things in the middle of a football game. Have you not seen the routines they make, those take hard work! Orchestras play classical music and make their sound flow in the room. Not only do they play classical music, but they also play loud and exciting music. Everything you can do while playing an instrument is enjoyable. Some things are more enjoyable than others like being able to listen to yourself making good music, going on fun field trips, and being able to find all different types of music.

While playing an instrument you play all different types of music, and all of the pieces of music are good. When you hear yourself play a song well you get a boost of confidence. Hearing your class play well makes you confident that your concert will sound great. It feels good to know that you're capable of playing music that others who aren't able to do. You get to enjoy the amazing sound your class makes. Whenever you play an instrument you normally audition for the class you want to get into and when you get into it, you are full of joy. It's always nice to know that you can achieve the level that you want to achieve. The opportunities you get while playing an instrument are endless.

When being in band or orchestra you get the opportunity to go on field trips. Schools don't normally go on field trips unless the students are in band or orchestra. They offer the field trips to people who play an instrument because of all their hard work they put into it. All the field trips you go on are enjoyable because of the people in your class. You always make friends whenever you join band or orchestra. Some schools know that the students want more fun, so they include more field trips than others. Every field trip is a gift to the students who play their instruments from the school. Some places that schools go to are Kings Dominion, Busch Gardens, Hershey Park, and many more exciting places. Those all have roller coasters, water activities, and carnival games, who wouldn't want to go there.

Every movie or show has a soundtrack which the classes can play. You can always search up the sheet music to any song you want to play. You can also make your own sheet music and play that yourself. You can play every song on an instrument. People enjoy playing the music they've wanted to play since they first started playing an instrument. There are movies that people love and the people who can play an instrument are able to play that movies theme song. Not a single song cannot be put in sheet music so, if anyone ever wanted to play their favorite song they could search it up and it would pop up. Even though some songs are harder to make sheet music for they're still possible to do.

When playing an instrument, practice does make perfect. Nothing about playing an instrument is easy, but everything about it is fun. The effort put into playing your instrument does pay off at the end. Playing well can make you so happy and proud of yourself. Not only are you proud of yourself, but others are proud of you. Being able to play an instrument is a privilege that not everybody gets. There is nothing that can stop someone from becoming a part of the music community. The friends you can make and go with to the exciting field trips. Play all the music you've ever wanted to play. Everything you can do in band is limitless. ",3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.0,4.0

To start with, the way I started to do the same things like him was because he got good grades. After that, started to think about my grades and his grade and I felt bad because my grades were bad. That's one way Generic_Name shared him wisdom with me.

Secondly, He was nice to me when I didn't know him so I was begin to nice to everyone. Then, teachers liked how I became nice and sweet. Another reason why to be nice is because you will want to treat someone the way you want to be treated.

Third, Generic_Name made me feel like a new person. You can make new friends like that too I made six new friends because I became nice. Teachers are nice back if your nice and let them teach the class so think about it and be nice to everyone.

This is how Generic_Name shared his wisdom with me. So now you know how to share wisdom with someone else. Generic_Name shared his wisdom with me because I follow direction like him, nice to everyone, made me feel like a different person.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
FFA3D98123DC,"I agree that having a positive attitude is the key to success because in life no matter what you do you need a positive attitude. for example when you go for a job interview you go into the place with a positive attitude of you wont get the job. its like getting a job you have to have a positive attitude when your working with your others or with customers. i think that in life everyone needs a positive attitude to accomplish there goals. I think that people that doesnt have a positive attitude wont get very far in life. because when i was in middle school i never had a positive attitude and i would get into a lot of trouble because of my attitude, and now that my attitude has changed im becoming successful in life. i think that in everything you do in life requires a positive attitude. you need a positive attitude when your talking to people. if you have a negative attitude people wouldnt want to be bothered by you because people dont like to be around people with a negative attitude. for example when you have a positive attitude people would like to be around you then to be around someone with a negative attitude.

being positive is the key to success because if your being negative your not going to be successful in life.    ",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5

To be yourself in a world that os constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.""

because, in this generation kids are trying to fit in with other kids, by changing the way that they speak or the way they dress. Kids also try to fit in by doing what other people tell them to do, making dumb decisions that could potentially end you up in jail or possibly something even worse effecting their future all because they wanted to fit in.

Peer pressure is a main factor in kids that are trying to fit in. Kids pressure other kids into making poor decisions when in reality they don't wanna do it but they wanna look cool infront of others kids so they do it anyways. In reality it isn't cool to do what people tell you to do especially when it's just to fit in with others.

In my opinion people shouldn't make poor decisions trying to fit in with the others, you should be yourself, it doesnt matter where you from or what type of clothes your wearing everyone should be accepted no matter who they are. Kids should be leaders not followers, you can end up with the wrong friends that could care less about you, but are only with you because you make the poor decisions they're telling you to make.

Kids should just be themselves, you don't have to try and fit in with the others, there plenty of other kids with possibly the same interest as you.",2.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0
FFD9A83B0849,"Working alone, students do not have to argue with other about decission of their proyects and have to work with someone they do not know; however, most students prefer to work as a group because students are able to dived work, to share ideas and to help each other. Working with a group allows students to work more efficiently. Personally and due to the facts, I would prefer to work with a group because working with other is more beneficial for students.

Firstly. Most students are required to do many proyects during each marking period which is to much for each student, and specially when there is a big proyect for each class that worth 10% of the period's grade, but working with a group the proyect might be diveded to each person in the group, and share between them. Each student have different and unique qualities that can be helpful to do do certain parts of proyects that for other can be difficult to do.

Secondly. Working with a group might be also seen as opportunity for student of gaining values of cooperation which is important to have due to many companies assign jobs to two or more people to realize them because of the different knowledges they can provide to each other. Companies usually use the phrase:

""Work as a team""

to make their productivity more efficiently. Teachers should see this as way of helping students to get expiriences of working as team, and also that way, we as students would get knowledge of others.

By allowing students to work with group teacher might be helping student to get more confident about their due to the fact that students can disscuss betweend eache other the topics and loook forward the best way of doing them. Schools are allowing students to stay after school which is perfectly fine for those students that are not able to go to a house of one the members of the group. A group might be also helpful for those students that are having issues turning their work on time because; now, they can get be supported by other and be more productive.

To conclude, No students should be in the position of having a big proyect with no enough time without the opportunity of work with a groups. Many companies are assigning jobs to be done by more than one person, they know that a team works more efficiently than one person, and teachers should do the same in their classes to help students to get their grades up, and also to be productive on turning work in. Working with a group should be allowed for students during classes to improve their qualities of coorperation and to have different points of view to do the best for subject.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0
