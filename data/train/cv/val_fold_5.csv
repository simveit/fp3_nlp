0016926B079C,"I think that students would benefit from learning at home,because they wont have to change and get up early in the morning to shower and do there hair. taking only classes helps them because at there house they'll be pay more attention. they will be comfortable at home.

The hardest part of school is getting ready. you wake up go brush your teeth and go to your closet and look at your cloths. after you think you picked a outfit u go look in the mirror and youll either not like it or you look and see a stain. Then you'll have to change. with the online classes you can wear anything and stay home and you wont need to stress about what to wear.

most students usually take showers before school. they either take it before they sleep or when they wake up. some students do both to smell good. that causes them do miss the bus and effects on there lesson time cause they come late to school. when u have online classes u wont need to miss lessons cause you can get everything set up and go take a shower and when u get out your ready to go.

when your home your comfortable and you pay attention. it gives then an advantage to be smarter and even pass there classmates on class work. public schools are difficult even if you try. some teacher dont know how to teach it in then way that students understand it. that causes students to fail and they may repeat the class.

0022683E9EA5,"When a problem is a change you have to let it do the best on you no matter what is happening it can change your mind. sometimes you need to wake up and look what is around you because problems are the best way to change what you want to change along time ago. A

problem is a change for you because it can make you see different and help you to understand how tings wok.

First of all it can make you see different then the others. For example i remember that when i came to the United States i think that nothing was going to change me because i think that nothing was going to change me because everything was different that my country and then i realist that wrong because a problem may change you but sometimes can not change the way it is, but i remember that i was really shy but i think that change a lot because sometimes my problems make me think that there is more thing that i never see in my life but i just need to see it from a different way and dont let nothing happened and ruing the change that i want to make because of just a problem. For example i think that nothing was going to change me and that i dont need to be shy anymore became i need to start seeing everything in a different ways because you can get mad at every one but you need to know what is going to happened after,

people may see you different but the only way that you know how to change is to do the best and don't let nothing or not body to change nothing about you. The way you want to change not one have that and can't do nothing about it because is your choice and your problems and you can decide what to do with it.

second of all can help you to understand how things work. For instance my mom have a lot of problems but she have faith when she is around people, my mom is scare of high and i'm not scare of high i did not understand why my mos is scare of high and in not scare of high and every time i see my mom in a airplane it make me laugh because she is scare and is funny, but i see it from a different way and i like the high but also she have to understand that hoe things work in other people because it can no be the same as you. For example i think that my mom and me are different because we are and i have to understand that she does not like high and i need to understand that. to help someone to understand how things work you need to start to see how things work in that persons life.

A problem is a change for you and can make you a different and help you to understand. Everyone has a different opinion and a different was to understand then others. everyone can see the different opinion and what other people think.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5

Another example of an act of kindess is when you help your friends to study for a test or explain them or when they need money you give some money is an act of kindess because you are helping your friend.

Another example is not trowing trash on the floor if you put the trash where belong that is an act of kindess because benefits the earth and the people.

009BCCC61C2A,"positive attitude is the key to success. I agree because you can do anything as long as you put your mind and soul into it and motivation you can accomplish it. Then so by doing it you feel good about yourself you'll feel unstable. But do what brings the best in you, what makes you yourself.

One way that importance of attitude is key to success is it motivates you to keep going forward. For example when you come across some difficulties you wont feel discouraged because your the limit and none other then you can or will change it. But the more discouraged you tend to feel at that moment you would wanna overcome it even if it makes whatever just as long as your mind is set to positive attitude you will accomplish it. Then so always remember what you put your mind to such as determination, positive attitude, willing you can its possible you will reach your goals. However you will with a positive mindset have a strong determination and you will build up self confidence in yourself.

Then another reason is to grow individually with hard work. Positive attitude isen't quite the easiest for some people its really difficult for others to learn how to or even if they are willing to. But others tend to not always have positive attitude in anything they're just negative and havent tried to give their all they are stuck upon what others think. Then about what really is,you just have to not listen to what anyone thinks and focus on what you can accomplish because if you dont you will let them reflect on you but you dont want that for yourself. Then there's always going to be that one negative person to try to bring you down its up to you if you let it effect you. Just ignore them if you dont you will bet it affect you and you dont wanna fall back just because of others. With that being said in order to move forward you have to go though things individually but thats were you find yourself again and makes you stronger then before what your weaknesses were there not anymore because when facing things individually you blossom to a beatifull flower with of course hard work and it isen't in vane because hard work ends up having a good result for positive attitude.

Next reason is to build selfcondifence. When having a positive mindset and most impotently willing we then build selfcondience our mind is a battlefield and we control it and its not about the selfcondicence its more about determination ourselves to it like we can or we will do it. After that its all depending on us weather we want to or not. Then after that the more we practice being positive in our battle fild the more selfcondidence we will have.

So then i hardly agree on positive attitude can guide you to succeed in life its all about three things determination willing and believing with those in mind you can tell all the negitive thoughts to go flying out the window because it has no door to let it in anymore. I truly incuage you to try it out if you want to see a big improvement to succeed in your life.

009F4E9310CB,"Asking more than one person for and advice help you take a strong choice? seeking for multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. Example presidential election,requires someone opinion and choosing a restaurant to eat at and place to visit. Theres good and bad opinion but pick one or two or more but choose one the help you make a great decision.

First many us citizen are required to vote. Many of them would have different opinion about who is the best candidates. Positive and negative opinions would be circulating about the candidates but you can ask more than person what they think about the candidates there be interesting opinion and some not so interesting think about what the many opinion you hear and think about the one the got you thinking the most.

on the other hand lots of people love going out to eat. Many people try new places to eat at some may hear good or bad opinion about a place but until you try it you can't tell your self is great or bad. Sometimes Google lets you see other people opinion the other people leaved about a certain place. to be honest my dad does this sometimes he goes online and search is up the place and then looks at the rate the place have and the comment as a result of the deadly corovirus (Covid-19) lots of people have decide not to travel. But theres certain people that just love to travel many of the occasion people travel to a place because they hear good thing about a place. for example thats how me and my family hear of Lego land my aunt tell my dad that this place was so amazing me and my family we have been a big fan o Lego and we really dint know this place existed.

finally sometimes people have positive and negative opinion about something or someone but is you job to find out the one the makes you fell like ""this is the one"" many people there own believed thats why you may hear different opinion. Have you ever ask for more than one opinions? i actually have that was went i was't sure which suit to put in a red or black suit so ask my mom dad ans sister they tell me the best suit was the black one.

02B36EBD5C66,"Students can benefit from this option, but also can affect them in different ways. Many students have difficulty coming to school every single day. One impediment may be transportation, a lot of them do not know how to drive, so they can not drive to school. Some students live in areas where the buses can't enter. Many of them walk to get to school every day or ride a bicycle. They face many problems but the biggest one is weather. The climate can change quickly, when is raining a lot or is cold these students stay at home, because there is no way how they can get to school.

Students can benefit by not attending everyday to school. For students who live far away from school is a great option, because they safe time and also they can work during the day. As we see many students have a job after school, and this is hard for them because they have to be active in school. There is a big problem because they come tired to school, and you see them sleeping in classes. They can not be concentrate because they do not have time to sleep. Many of them do not have time to do homework, or different projects they have to complete.

It is a great option to have schools that offers distance learning. This action help many students but also can affect them. In my opinion when you attended to school everyday you can learn more. Because you have all the resources you need to understand, and complete the assignments. But students who like to work hard and take their time to studying in their houses, it can also be easy for them.

Before that there was not technology is was extremely hard. Now that the science had grown up, and the technology appear, we have a way more opportunity to do many things. One opportunity is to studying online from our houses. As I said now that we have technology, we have more opportunities and is really easy to find stuff that you need to learn in your school.

In my conclusion, I think is good for our society having those school who offers distance learning. Because many students can not be in school everyday, and this action help them to keep studying. If this program does not exist many of them could never go again to school, because of all the impediments they have to attend school, and they will never accomplish their dreams.

0316F6288791,"The new generation of students decide to take their classes in online. Although if the students take classes in online they might allow to finish high school in a short time,also they might be safe at home, they can take more free time to work or enjoy with their family, and graduate as soon as possible and start the college.

Even thought some people might say students shouldn't take classes in online because they can not learn good enough, they might be distracted or even ask any question to solve their problem, regular high school have different program to help students to be successful on their grades. In this case students need to talk with any consular or teacher in school to give some advantage and disadvantage about online class, student might need to know their benefits on what they going to do for their own good. Most people care about education, students need put some interest.

concluding with this state argument student should take any classes in online because they don't put much interest to learn any assignment, students might need to attendance to a regular high school to learn and have better apprenticeship, and abilities for their accomplishment, students in high school are more successful, they have good opportunities to get in the best colleges. Nowadays teenagers are more focus in having fun, some of them do not know that education is very important, if we want to have a good job and better future, every child need education first, but students are following good rulers.

according to this argument I have this experience my brother want to take his classes in online because he does not want to come to the school, i still in a normal high school almost at the end of the first quarter and my brother still waiting a call for his classes. He said it was his best choice but in my opinion that was not a good idea because if come to the school i learn and understand my classes, when a teacher is explaining and helping me to do my problem i feel more exciting about it. I want to be a great student and learn everything instead of be at home waiting for an acceptation for classes.

concluding with my argument students would not benefit to attend classes in online, attending to the school is more important and benefit, they take serious their resposabilities in everything,they became more measure,classes in online never going to be same as the regular school, students never are going to learn very well, teeneger really need to attendance the school for a better education.

Think about it if your positive somethings in life will be easier then other things. I believe theres good karma and bad karma if your positive to people and help people out good stuff will happen to you that's called good karma. but if you bully kids, cuss at elderly and don't help people out karma is going to bite you in the butt. That's why it's always good to be nice to people you don't know even if they aren't good to you still be nice because at the end of the day good karma is coming to you.

Look at these famous people they made it out of the struggles because they worked hard and they helped people out. Some people don't get chances to show other people they talent if you keep working hard and get your mindset in the right place you will have a chance to make out the struggles. it's hard to make it out of struggles some people are working hard busting they butts and they barley get money to pay off the bills. Most likely the people that work hard are the people that have positive attitude not all the people that work hard because some people that work hard are rude and helpless. For the people that are helpless and rude won't get as far from the people that have positive attitude.

Positive attitude can get you a lot of good stuff in the future. As long as you stay positive and work hard you will be successful in life. Positive attitude will get you places in the future that you couldn't imagine when you was little. Although it's not going to be a easy road to get where you want to be you always got to try. See if your positive in your job and you help people out a lot people are going to start to like you that's one way to be noticed. I'd rather work hard with people I know are positive and helpful then working with rude helpless people.

Look at the people with negative attitude are they getting anywhere?. They ain't getting nowhere with negative attitudes. Usually the people with the negative attitudes are the ones that get bullied, ain't raised right, or they just won't listen no matter what you tell them. If they change they life around and start listening and respecting people they will get respect back. If you start switching your life up people will start noticing and they will be happy you. But some people won't change and they will get sent away to prison if they keep up what they do.

In the future always remember that positive attitude is the key to success in life. No matter what people say about you always stay positive don't let the negative people take you down because they said a bunch of nonsense about you that wasn't truth. Don't tolerate bullying either if you see someone getting bullied stand up for them having a positive attitude ain't only about yourself it's about helping people that needs help. I've seen videos of people sitting down on the bus and not move for a lady that can barley walk it shows you how people are now it's pathetic. I'd rather help people out and get known for it then get known for not helping out people.      ",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0
04ACA7EB3994,"No,I dont think students should attend online classes from home. Because online classes might be sometimes harder for them to understand and to get help. It is always better to take classes in the person so students can learn better and get more experience and they can easily get help from the teachers whenever they want to. Online classes make people lazy and dont went them to do anything. They should get experience of going to school so they can learn more better. In my opinion in person classes are way better than the online classes. And it help students to be on time always.

Students should take the classes in person so they can attend school daily and get more active. It is totally different experience by taking classes online or in person beacuse sometimes its hard to understand from the online classes and students cant get it. Online classes are good for the students who need to graduate early and they cant have more in person classes so they can take the classes online and graduate on time. online classes make students lazy and dont they dont do it on time and they get lazy by staying at home. Online classes might be harder sometimes than the in person classes. Some people are used to online classes because they feel they are more easier for them. online classes are good for students who want to complete their all the required credits. Some people dont get time to do the online classes beacuse they have to go to work and they cant able to finish everything on time. They put more effort by going to school and sometimes they just dont feel like doing to online class. Online classes are good for those who wants to complete there courses early. Students should attend school so they learn more better. Sometimes online classes might be pressure for some students because its alot of them to do it and it depends on them whenever they want to do it and they should finish before the end of the school year and itmight be more stressful for them to complete everything soon. They should try there best to attened school beacuse it is more better than doing the online classes.

Online classes make some people lazy and they dont get experience of going to school. They should go to school and attend the classes so they can do all there work in class and get help from teachers whenever they feel difficulty beacuse getting help from online classes are harder it is a bit harder to get help from internet because some people dont understand them and it is more easier when they get help in person and they can understand everything easily and ask questions whenever they would like to. While,Some people might say yes it is better to attend online classes rather than going to school because they have to work in the morning and they dont get time to come to attend in person classes because they dont feel like going to attened them so they attend them at home. Students dont get much things in online classes and the feel difficulty sometimes and its hard for them to get some help from someone. Becasue if they go to in school classes they can get more help and they can get help for them to go to college. They can ask their counselour about how to apply for the colleges they want to get admission. They can get know whats going on in school and they can attend many activites in school and take some electives classes so they can learn more. Some people just want to take the classes online becasue they dont have the time to go to school.

Some students attend both online and in person classes beacuse they cant get enough classes at school in a year and they want to graduate on time so they take online classes so they can finish everything on time. It is little harder to attend both at a time beacuse they had to go to work too and they dont get time to do online classes. One of my friend jose he had done the same. He had to graduate on the same year but he was missing one class and he was not able to graduate on the same year so he went to his conseolur and he asked him what can he do to graduate on the same year so she gave him the idea for the online class and he started doing it. He felt it little harder but he was able to finish on time and he was able to graduate on time. Some students are always late on doing on online classes because they dont have enought time to do it If students get to in schools they get to know more about school and be more responsibility and they can get more education so they dont feel difficulty when they go to college they should always have experience of high school so they dont have any problem in college later on. And students put more effort in class because they have to get good grades so they can get good GPA and easily get admission in the college they want to. Online classes are sometimes harder depends on what class are they taking. Maths class might be harder to do in online classes beacuse you always need someone to help you because you might have so many questions and it will be harder to do maths in computer.

In conclusion,I would say it is better to take classes in school so students can learn more better and its more easier for them. In person classes are always better and students can get more help and understand better. Students can take part in activites. Students get more active by coming regularly to school. By coming to school daily it helps students to learn more and they get good experience for coming to school by making new friends and getting to know more about school. And they wont feel any difficulty beacuse there will be someone who can help them whenever they want to. By taking online classes students dont learn more like they can can learn in school classes. Students should take the online classes only if it is needed them to complete all required credits they want to graduate. Online classes might help some people and they feel more comfotable. But in my opinion i would rather take in school classes because it would help me in future by getting good experience of highschool and learn more",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5

Most students have a good ability in class like study, presentation, remember,... But if they want to graduate earlier in three school years, they have to take off elective class in school, and take more time to study more subject class. During in the graduate earlier, students can enter college and finish it one year early or they could have one year rest for work a job and thinking what they should study in college or university.

However, some student have no good ability for study or student have second language can take more than three school years. They need time to get better in high school before enter college.

Finally, in my point of view, I think we should allow high school students to graduate in three school years. But any students need more year to keep going in high school, we should lets them do that.",3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.5

Some impressions that i have meet, don't change and stay the same as i meet them with time.

Some impressions don't change because for example, their character, their bad past, their sad past and their bad style of life. Some first impressions are hard to change, but some people don't think the same because most people use to change thir first impression a lot with the time. And also, some people think the first impression is almost impossible to change because is the key that is most important in most cases, when you meeting someone, interviewing for a job and showing your values; if you didn't showed a good impression at first time, you missed it. most when that person is living a too good style of life, bad style of life or a bad character is hard to change the first time impression.

06C9FC1267BB,"Do people accomplish more if they are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Olympic people did not just sit at home and got an Olympic Golden medal for nothing, they worked hard to achieve their goals. Yes, you always have to do something to become the succeed person that you want to become, to reach and achieve your goals, and to stay active and social with others.

In my native country of Generic_City people always work hard, to get money, feed their families, and also teach their kids how to succeed in school and other athletic stuff, with the bad community that we have in their. As well as here a lot of people study and work hard to succeed. For example, at Generic_school we have a cooking class, they always push us forward and try to teach us new methods how to cook and seasoning the food, that gives a huge opportunity for the students who want to do it for living in the future.

Another reason, is that it will be twice as hard if you say I want to achieve this goal at the end of this semester, but you are not working to improve your self to achieve it. This is problem that everyone have, like on our swimming team I had a really difficult goal to achieve, I started to push my self to the limit and work as hard as everyone else just to achieve it. And at the end of the season I did achieve it, which was to get a time that under 35:00 seconds, I shock myself and made my coach proud of me be achieving it.

Finally by working outside, or joining an athletic team, or vising an old friends it's another really good way to staying active and social with others, and talking to other people is another great way to solve a lot of problems, specially when you are sad or having a bad time.

Other's may think that staying not active for a bit or at all is a good way, they think that because having a time alone with yourself kind of make you think what is happening around you, However, if you fill your time with friends and activities that you like to do, you will not feel want to be alone because you will have a good friends all over you all the time, and they will help you to reach the goals that you want to achieve.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0

I agree with this because some times parents try to change their children, also school making decision for their students, religion first point parents trying to change their children, in some cases parents try to persuade their children from what they want to do or from what they want to be on the future, if some one of their children want to play soccer and if their parents do not know everything about soccer they search anything they just say no and they make their children to try something different or if the child do not want to go the place that they are going most of the parents do not listen what their sons want or like and also sometimes parents make their children to be what they do not what to be in some cases parents tell they children that they need to play an instrument liket the guitar but maybe that child wants to play the drums. some famous people are unhappy because their parents make them to become famous but maybe that child do not want to do that.

second point some times school makes decision for students too some times students do not want to take some classes and school choose for them, in some parts students do not like to wear uniforms and they make them to wear it, in case that you came from other country and you do not speak the same language you need to be able to learn because if you did not do it you are not able to be in the school and if you do not understand what are they talking about is hard but you need to be like them because you do not have people who speak the same language as you do, so you have to be part of something even if you do not like it third point religion is there to try to change your mind they are many religions in the world but all depends if you want to choose one of those religions but some times people try to make you part of that religion and some times you change completly of who you was if that work for you is perfect but if not you are going to be completly different person, you need to dress different at you usual do, and also they tell you what is wrong and what is not wrong even if you did not do anything wrong they think that and they always want you to belieb things that maybe are not true but why we need to follow that and why we need to beliebe that, so if you want to do something do that thing because you want it not because someone tells you.

In my opinion I agree with what Albert Emerson wrote because to be our self in this world that is constantly traying to make us something else is the greatest accomplishment, is hard to be our selfs because people are always traying to tell us about what we are going to do because for the society what they do is good but maybe you have a different idea but most of the time you need to do what they tell you to do the best accomplishment is being ypour self and being what you want to be and if you want to do something just do it and do not listen about what other people say or what they think because people are never happy with the things that you do.

Being a nurse will be difficult in a many ways, but it's a matter of learning of how to do something.

More ways to be a nurse is by being organized because you need to know what the students need to become a nurse.

Hopefully the manager can take this into conservation if I could get this job. I would show to make schools better by having a fantastic nurse taking care of students when they aren't feeling well at school.

Many calm that working alone will not share your ideas with other clearly, it better working in a group have fun and to talk to others.

To begin the benefits of working in a group is more beneficial because having more ideas. For example my sister, Generic_Name she loves sharing her ideas. Each ideas they share with they classmates. They can have have a example on what there writing about and have an idea on what there talking about. For example my Mom,is A fourth grad teacher she loves seeing others sharing it means a lot to her. She partners up the kids and so she, can see on thing the can come up with.

0AFC8CE27321,"By the time students enter high school, I believe that they should have an idea of what type of career they would like to pursue after they graduate. For some students, committing to a specific career at young age sometimes is a good idea as long as you have a backup idea for a different career in case you decide that you do not want to pursue in that career anymore, thats why committing to a career at a young age is only sometimes a good idea because you'll never come up with another career if you keep changing your mind. The courses that you study in high school should be thought about as well because maybe you need a specific degree from a course in order to pursue in that career.

I believe that, if a student is going to commit to a career that they should be very passionate about this career, they should be at least a junior in high school so that they've had time to get a feel of the other careers and decide which one they enjoy and suits them the best, and they should keep in mind the requirements that are needed, the benefits, and the types of jobs that it offers to them. Students who commit to a career at a young age are usually athletes, or they plan on working in their family business.

Pursuing your career needs a lot of hard work in school especially in this generation because you're going to need to go to a good college so you need a good GPA because you're going to want to go to the college that has a good academic program for the career that you plan on pursuing. Therefore, you need to go to college, and work hard so you can get a good job because most jobs, don't hire anyone without a college degree.

Finally, thats what I think about choosing the right career for yourself, and committing to a career at a young age. although some may still believe differently and disagree with my view on this issue.                        ",4.5,5.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,4.5

I would like to accomplish to become a billionaire for many reasons.

First of all if I would accomplish to become a billionaire, I would buy a house to live in, because I'm not gonna stay in my mom's house all my life, and I don't think my mom would like that either. I would have a pool in the back of my house. I always wanted a pool so I could swim there and wouldn't have to go all the way to the water park. Or just relax in the pool whenever I have free time. Have parties so my friends and I have fun, and my mom would't have to tells us to keep it down.

Second I would buy my mom a house, a car and some new clothes. she deserves it for all the hard work she's done. I would sell the house that we're living in now. And all the money that I will get for the house, I will give it to my mom. I would take her to see a car that she likes and buy it, because the one that she has is a little old and she is always having trouble with it. I would take her to the Mall to see different stores so she can buy different kinds of clothes that she likes.

Then I would buy a hospital. I would not let the hospital charge too much for the patients though, because whenever I go to the hospital they charge to much, and some people don't got a lot of money. I would hire the best people for the job so they can help their patients, some nurses or doctors are not too good at their job. I would let any patient in no matter where they're from, because some hospitals judged the way people look, their race or the color of their skin.

Finally I would help the homeless. Not all the money that I would have would be for me, because some I would give it to the homeless. I would buy them food and clothes, because some homeless people have clothes and some don't, and some are just waiting to be feed. I would buy an entire city block, so I can construct apartments for the homeless. whenever I look out the window, when I'm in the car, I see a lot of homeless people siting in the side walk or sleeping on it.

For example, if you are a student you can use technology to help you to do homework, project, or specific things that require technology. However, there are some people that need technology for their life that is require, if you are very sick doctors will have to use technology to understand what sickness do you have.

To begin with, using technology you can do many things at the same time that can help you in your daily. For example, there are some time when you have a lot of things to do, and you don't have a lot of time, but if you use technology you will able to make it, because you can do many things at the same time with technology. Also, technology help you with your job, now there are many machines that you can use in your job that does not need any force of your body, those machines work by using technology. If you work as a security you can security the building by just be in one office and use technology,

you can install cameras around the build and you can security the building from that office by using the camaras, so you won't have to be walking around all the build, and will take you a lot of time to make it.

Second, technology can make your life easier. People require to technology when there are things that human can not do. For example there are some job that are very hard that require a big force that is impossible for human, but they can use some special machines that are very strong and can do the work. Also, you can search in google things that you don't know. For example, address,news, thing about History, books it is much easier to read a book in google than going to the library that take you more time than just type the book tittle in google.

0F7900292BB6,"Have you event been told that you had to chose a career before high school. I have, and I say we as young adult should pace ourselfs and not rush this important life decision so early. Because that decision de the person and the time, not important for take one career. Each young person has a decision to purse a career or not because it is optional.

First of all I disagree whit this idea, because young students are more like to listen what adults tell them to chose. That ends up on kinds chosen careers they dont want or like and in the long run it takes away their Dreams, money, and time. The kinds need more inspiration for that in future they take one career like: doctor, arquitec, teacher, and other carriers is good have one inspiration. Is good have persons that support in every time like Mom, family or dad. Because much young not listen the adult or not have support in the family for that reason they do not pursue a career.

Secondly us young adults need to expand our knowledge in the work field. Like for example we need to watch videos and have people already working their to explain How they work and ward they do. It would be a good idea to have two examples of people: a person who has ready finished his career and has work and money and the other, who does not finish his studies and asks for money in the street. Is good what a young thing in her future the difficult is life outside working in the hot or cold not is nathing essy.

Everybody have that thing in her future, on good future for the family, wife, sons, daughter. Is good have idea in the High school that like you. Because you like draw you take the career arquitec is good idea. The people inspired draw like building, the natural place everything is good. The people like arquitec to created building in Dubai is very nice I don't no but is beautiful in only imagination. Much person no have idea the important is the study in the life.

Much young take to abandon the high school and decision working because no everybody have east opportunity other people need more working because not have more family. I need one program or event for the people have one idea the good that is study. Study have for the benefit apprenticeship.    ",4.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5

going for a ride in you bike to the park is good for your body and mind because your leg movements aid the muscles, the fresh air blowing in your face feels relaxing, and because you can burn unnecessary calories while riding.

It is good to go to the park with your family because you can get some helpful advises from them, because you can have a stronger bond with you family and/or friends, and because you can talk about life problems and how to solve them.

it is best to fly a kite at the park because when flying kites, you have to maintain it's height which is a good challenge, because you can compete with friends, and because you can teach others how to fly a kite

Overall, riding a bike and spending time with your family are both good things to do at the park. life aiding activities exist outdoors all around the world. Going to the park is a good choice when thinking about family or frineds.                  ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0

I think that this practice could be disadvantage because it will be two more hours of work, between longer day , the estudents will be using more energy in those ten hours every day.

Then, we have to use more resources at school for the students be working in class those resources could be naturals, we could be wasting many papers,water when we are in the school and we have to make progress of this kind of resources.

Also, ten hours each day we will be wasting resources as electricity every class could be using computers,monitors,tablets, and we have to find a way how to save this resources at school.

11DD0B26B584,"Although some say schools should not offer classes online because when students are out of school someone else could be doing the work for them and they will not be learning anything, actually schools should offer classes online because most of the students who go to schools have to work and they drop out of school to work and taking classes online would help them be educated at the same time they're working.

Those who believe schools should offer classes online have their reasons because research shows that 80% of the students that go to high school work after school. They get home late and they have to do homework, and they go to bed too late and having to wake up at least at 7 am to go school it's hard. They are falling asleep in class and they don't want to do any work. Taking classes online helps because they can take them at anytime.

Also, some students have to walk to get to school. In winter they have to suffer all the cold weather and that's what make them sick. Last year I saw a student who broke his arm cause it was snowing and the sidewalk was really slippery,and I also saw a guy who got beat up by a group of guys on the street he was on his way home,and if they can take classes online they would not have to walk to school, and those situations wouldn't happen.

In addition, research shows that 70% of the students that have attended classes online have been successful which means taking classes online really helps students. They can rest more at home and they don't have to wake up early every morning.

In conclusion,schools should provide classes online because colleges,universities also provide them and most of the people who have taken them have been successful from their classes. That is the best thing schools could do for the students.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0

Greetings Generic_Name I'am writing this letter to you, to let you know that am very interested on going to visit and learning more about your dealership. For the future am planing on pursuing the Auto tech field. In the past I worked at a Mc Donald's. At the moment am a high school student who is involved in the Auto tech classes, I'm also a member of the engine building team. When I first came to this the U.S I started working with my brother on landscaping, under a lot of pressure.

When I first started working at Mc Donald's I didn't know a lot about how to treat costumers. With in the time I experience multiple occasions in which I had to be patient and listen to the costumers. I had to learn how to work with different people and different personalities. Thanks to the opportunity Mc Donald's gave to work there I gain a lot of knowledge on treating costumers. Now I can say that am confident and willing to work with others and help costumers.

At the moment I'm involved in the auto tech classes and am a member of the engine building team which take place after school. Being in this classes has help me learn and gain experience on cars. This classes have taught me how to be organized and clean with the tools. In the engine team I learn how to be faster on everything and also being careful. Graduate being a Auto technician is my goal.

When I first came to the United States I needed to work, thats when I started working in landscaping with one of my older brothers. working in landscaping is hard, you have to deal with heavy equipment sometimes. I remember my brother use to put a lot of pressure on me sometimes, because he needed the job to be done in one day. There I learn how to control myself during peer pressure. Thanks to my brother now I know how to use power equipment and delicate tools.

With all this being said I will like to be selected to go visit your dealership and learn more about it. I see many oportunities for me at your dealership. I will like to have an Idea of what are the requirements to pursue the auto tech field. With all my experience I'm positive and confident that I can achieve my goal of being a technician one day.

12F2BF34883F,"I do agree wih Emerson's statement, because i've had past experiences where i did not know a thing but then i started to get better at it by practicing on what i wanted to get better at. There is this game that got really popular last year it was called fortnite and everyone was playing it, so I decided to download it and play it because it was free.

I was playing and did not know what I was doing I didn't know how to build or shoot or run i didn't even know where I was at , I started playing more often and got my first win with my friends and then I started learning how to build and strategies to get kills, but i honestly didn't like it so I stopped playing for a while and played different games that I liked more because this game seemed to childish for me to play. After a while my friends would tell me to play so I would but I got bored and played different games, then a new season came out on the game and I had money so I bought it and after that everything changed.

I really started to like it now because it had a good storyline and it was more fun, I knew how to play so I would just goof around then I really started to practice with my friends and decided to stop playing around we would fight one on one's to practice i would lose but i just kept going and going until I would get more kills now i've been playing for 7 seasons which is a very long time, seasons are usaually 60 to 80 days in the game they aren't like seasons in real life like spring or summer their like tv shows how they have new seasons and stuff like that.

Anyway I do agree Emerson's statement because on how much better at I got at the game and how long i've been plaiying and the experience I have in that game, I started out really bad at it than started getting better and better the more I practiced and played. Not only me though I know people who started out around the same time I did which was in season two and they were just as horrible as I was now it's season eight and some of them are even better than me.

I also agree with Emerson's statement because i used to fail in math since I was a little kid than last year when i was in 10th grade i had a good math teacher who would help me alot and after a lot of work and help that was the first time i passed math and also this year to had a teacher who do the same she helped me a lot and I passed that class too.",2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5
12F89E196E97,"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are actually doing."" Idle refers to people who are not busy or keeping themselves occupied to their powers or implements. You would think being inactive serve a purpose, but personally i think it does not. To be occupied gets you to accomplish a lot in life. People who do not keep themselves busy tend to not get far in life.

In other words, to not be engage in work or activity is a very poor thing;there could be plenty of opportunities for you, but just because you are inactive you could miss these awesome opportunities. When we lack the ability to work or to keep ourselves occupied we are being inadequate. People who do not push or work themselves never actually really make it anywhere in life. Therefore, if we are always ""doing"", we will not fail to meet our expectations. If athletes were never idle or always ""doing"" some of them would of never made it in life.

However, inactivity does not serve a purpose because when you are inactive or simply not doing anything you miss out on what life has to bring you. We would accomplish so much if we always kept ourselves busy neverless. People who lack strength or courage are inactive. So when teachers say use your time wisely they are telling you to be Idle. It is wonderful when you are doing, being active, or pushing yourself because when you do these things you never miss out on any opportunity.

Lastly, when you are Idle you serve a purpose for yourself, family members, and you encourage others around. People who are active push themselved to do better. Being active can get you a good job because people will speak highly of you and recommend you to others. You ever heard of ""hard work makes the dream work"" when you put yourself to work anything is possible. Your peers around you will look up to you because you get stuff done and it would push them to do as you do.

In conclusion, Thomas Jefferson says when you are determined never to be Idle you serve no purpose and you are determined to get knowhere in life. Keeping yourself occupied can get you to places in life where you thought you could never be because you are putting the effort. People who move with no purpose are called lazy people these people do not accomplish as much as those who work. Thomas Jeffersom is right to be Idle is wonderful to those who put in the effort and try their best no matter what. Anything is possible as long as you are always at work.",3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0
1300AD075785,"Based on what

Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote,

''Unless you try to do something beyond what you already mastered, you will never grow.""

I would have to say that i agree with his statement because as a high school student i like to go beyond on what i already know what to do. Emerson wants yous to take another step in what we do he wants us to grow wont you? knowing that we are capable of doing something so much bigger and better and just be able to grow in are generation. Success is something that every6 high school student wants to do we want to get better at something, we want to pass are classes and if we are not willing to go beyond and put forth effort then i dont think we will be able to grow.

High school is a great way to show this especially if your a student athlete; lets say that you play baseball or softball or any other type of sport that takes time to master. Playing a sport is not easy especially if you want to get a scholarship. I get ask this question all the time ""have you yet mastered being a Cather and going beyond that point to see what you have in stored?"" I have mastered the skills of a softball catcher but i know if i go beyond that point and keep practicing i know that i will be a great softball player in my years to come. Believing in your self to do something can also help you grow, just being able to say I got this and giving it all you got just gets you a step closer to becoming a master and growing into it. Another this is mistake those are alright , no one is perfect everyone is going to have there flaws and thats ok thats another way of growing and learning; won't you want to go beyond something you already mastered and try something new to grow?

Emerson wanted us to read this quote and think about what it meant to us. I ready this quote and it gets me to think "" so if i go beyond on my catching and try something else i could grow into the sport and play multiple positions on the field instead of just one."" I could also say the same thing about JROTC in my school as being part of the drill team and going to competitions. These are good examples on what we can all think about going beyond d and farther in what we already know an think about what we can do better so we can grow and learn from are mistakes. High school is a great place to start not even then you can start when ever you want just make sure you know what you want to do and just have fun and enjoy your life. The quote can also be for adults, who have already mastered in something like for example my father, he created his own software and designed it for offices and he is out of town right now in Generic_City so that he can install it and, just grow from that experience he is going beyond on what he dose at work and just making something great happen.

The Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ,""unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" if you go this prompte and you read it and you have to pick if you agreed or disagree what would you pick? what would you tell me to make me agree or disagree with you?

136B3124BE79,"In my opinion the students can't go to college when they are too young, they don't have too much experience, those societies have to accept the reason why they are too young to think about a career, they cannot expected something that is different just think about it, the reason they are young it doesn't mean they can have a though about their career yet.

1, They don't have too much experience.

ex: When your'e in school the only thing that you have to think is in your grades, and your classes ,so that's why your experience is not count because there is no experience for it.

2. They are too young to think to go college.

ex: Sometimes your age counts a lot when your'e thinking about college because when you are older you can think clear what you want for your future.

3. Not every student have any plan to college some of them can go. but other student have different thoughts.

ex: No all of the students likes go to school. so they cannot have though like have plan to take a career..

Students of high school can't expect what they want for their future, this can make harder the things because students can already start to think about college that can make more complicated, each student is different some of them want a career other don't wanna go to college they just want get a work and get money, so is impossible all the student want go at college when are too young. The experience always have point because if you don't know what you want for your future, it can make more difficult the things.

This is usually the time that you are in your sports practice or music lesson, or even relax at home and watching TV. However, things are different now. you lost the option to go home after the normal school time, because the school is extending the school day hours. It is not fair for the student to force them to stay any longer than the regular school time, it can simply miss up the whole plain of students' after school activities. The school should not extending the school hours, because student might have activities and practice after school, and it is the right for students to choose to stay in school when the school is ended.

For example, I have a lot of after school activities, and I always schedule them by looking at the time where school ends. I usually have music lesson right after school, it will be not convenient for me If the school hours are extended. I have to reschedule them, and decides with my private teacher. I might not have the time for the class because my private teacher and I are both very busy. The extending of school hours have the possibility to make me not taking the music lessons,because the conflict of the time. It is absolutely not worth it because , none of the new stuff will be taught in the extended hours, and we will most likely have more homework than usual. If we have more homework and more hours at school, our grade will most likely decrease because since many activities are squeezed to a short chunk of time, we will have less time to do our homework.

In addition, It should be optional for students to stay on after school sections. However, there are people who have very few after school activities, and they are welling to stay in school. That is why school have after school sections.

Instead of extending normal school time, we should let students to go on after school sections because it is better for the student to manage their own time and it is more beneficial for them. Students can stay in school for two hours every day in the week after the normal school time. There are many options for students to choose. Students can choose to study with a teacher in certain subject or work in the library if they want to study. Students can also go to the gym and play sports or even join a club like drama. Any options that students choose is benefit for them because they are learning in different kinds of way which might be more helpful than their regular class. It is clear that when students have trubble or issue in a subject, it is better for them when they come to the teacher one on one after school, because it is easier for them to understand the problem and it is easier for the teacher to only explain to one person.

Over all, it is a bad diction to extending the school time. It will not help or benefit the students and it is a wast of time for the students. It more better for student that they go to their practice and after school activities or go to any after school sections. The student will be more beneficial and more welling to learn than go to their regular class for an extra one and a half hour. ",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

For example if some students have to work , and because their work's schedule take them a lot of time or they have to work at night, they do not feel like waking up earlier in the morning, sometimes they start to getting late to classes, missing classes or missing all days of school, but if the student try to taking classes online can be really helpful for them; since they can have their schedule at their convenient, the opportunity or the facility of making up their on schedule according to their others activities.

Also when someone have to travel a lot for some reason, taking the classes online they do not have stay in the same place every time they are taking the classes, it dose not matter, they can take it anywhere they want, the only two things they need is a computer, and also to have internet connection, and thats it, they should be good with those two things or some people do not have that facility of moving of one place to other, they do not have the money to defray cost for the transportation, or is just to far away from their houses, so the classes online are a way to fix that problem.

There is a large percentage that the students that are taking or took classes online are or were going great, their are doing a successful work, they are being tempting to show more attention to their classes, a lot people say that they feel the classes easier, and also that is easier to study,

when the classes have videos they can put back the video over and over, when ever they want, how many times they want, where ever they want,if they want the teacher to do not talk fast or to do it they can regulate that also, they save a lot of money, because they do not have to spend a lot of money in materials, like for posters and things like that, they do not have to be with some people that distract them from the classes and is also faster to get the classes done.

So how is showed the opportunity that some schools bring them is wonderful, it have a lot of benefits for us, like some students are more successful taking the classes online, so much students are interested in the classes online, feel like is better for them so that way they can be taking classes and doing other things, they just have learn how to manage their time; people that work can do their classes at morning and go work at night, they can have a flexible schedule.",4.0,2.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5

If I wanted to learned; I would stayed at school or watch a video to how to English, biology, or what classes do I chose from. But online or video conferencing are very different. online can be probably a website, YouTube, (Example like be able watch how to do math) or other. video conferencing is probably like a chat room or some video live.

Online is a great way to learn because I use on homework, essay, Google, YouTube, and other website. And here an of example. If I wanted how make a cake and when I used online website. It bring the website how to bake a cake. And there simple as that. But sometime if I ever get like a hard assignment and I checked it online, and it gave me the wrong answer, then sometimes the website can't be everything right. But I go ahead and tried other website to see if there a correct answered.

Now let say that I had to studied a lion. I can go online to checked in Google and it bring me to whole bunch of website, and click one of those website to see if there a way to studied some lion or go to YubeTube to watch how scientist studied theses creatures.

Video conference is probably like talking to a teacher or maybe live chat. And the way I think of the video conferencing is not to bad. It like you're teacher or someone is teaching you, and its like simpler to school. If I wanted to do it, like if there a problem that I need to fix then I go to video conference so they can helped me and the question. But I think its a great idea to do it.

The way I see is online is a helpful and video conference is helpful too. But I think it like home school staying at home and studied online or video conference. So my reasons is it a way to learned fast, getting good grades, or other information that you need for the future. And here a other reason why to use online or video conference. Online is been update like a few times. For example lets say Google doc. Google doc has been one the greatest website that I ever used. In that website, you can do almost everything like book project, essay, making slide shows and other helpful tools. But video conference is pretty helpful too. And my example is like if I need help I can contact my fellow people to help me.

Finally the best way to learned is sometimes online for helpful website and video conference to contact if teacher or other can help me. But I likely used online because it pretty helpful because let say I forgot a textbook and my homework is due the next day. Well I can go online and check my answer if i got it right.

Well, when you be yourself you every moment want to be something else,something new to know how capacity you have to be yourself. When you thinking in yourself your days be more easy, fun, you enjoy yourself in a world because you are only in the world nobody is like you, you are the only who make the better decisions in your life and is something constantly trying to make you something else because is the most and greatest accomplishment that you have is like a gift that your received and you need to care.

When you constantly trying to make you something you learn something that you don't know; something that surprise you because you never think that you can do, and you say I can do that thing and I want to experiment more things spontaneous because is better when that things have spontaneous because left better and so cool and impressive to you. Experiment more things new help you to be better every moment, to that these for you can helped an others persons when they need our help, when meet with one situation where somebody need help motivate that he or she can do it nothing is impossible, because a lot of peoples in the world don't believe in their self because all that time suffrage bullying they thing that they don't serve for nothing they believe in that bad words, is for these reasons that one situation appear in front of our eyes helped, spoke with love,respect,be courteous because when you spoke with one persons that have these problems where suffrage bullying, bad words that others peoples say they feel miserable have hatred,resentment and all of times they don't want to talk, you need or our need to going to these peoples and spoke with love, love is one of the most good gun that we have is the most important in that around world. A lot of peoples suffrage depression, anxieties, contempt, and racism, and to much peoples lose their lives because they don't support all that bad words,contempt and racism they suicide about that bad situation that they pass, is not necessary to arrive to these situation when we can change that world, stop to that bullying,racism we need to stay up, help these peoples and to these form too we be better persons these help too to our lives to see all that things different and get a solution because nothing is impossible when you purpose to me a good and better person.

Is time to care yourself, is time to listen your heart, yours words, and be better for yourself not for that others peoples, is time to return to be you for make that things that you want for you,don't make things for that others peoples see, want at have happy peoples, made because you want to continue with you life, dreams, expectations, careers, and because these make that you feel happy, interesting, confident, sure, cute, fun, and enjoy your victory. We need to get that goods words specific when it's for important persons because they want that better things for you, you don't need to get the bad words that you need to put in the trash so to these form that bad words don't affect you in nothing in your life. Then when you need to be something don't tell to everybody because a lot of time that peoples have envious yours victories then they get a angry things because have zealous that you did it. The important things spoke with that persons that really is important to you that person helped you to celebrate later your victory with you.

Make your things individuality because that work that you doing left good and you have your owns opinions,strategies,problems,situation,statements,solutions you work better when you work individually, like these work on me, when a work individuality I have my owns ideas because when a work in groups I feel that a can't put all my ideas a need to put all that ideas together and them we need to decide for one of the ideas the most interesting and important ideas, for me is better when you work individuality.

Trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplished, bec a use you can learn and make a new thing,because every day our want to change the world with all bad expectations, etc we need to care whatever word that we spoke to don't hurt nobody with any word all persons in all of world needed be different because a lot kids in these time what make whatever they want don't want to make that parents say that is something that we need to change.

Yourself is something that need to care because these defined what type of people you are, the values that you have, is something delicate and important; You need to have persons that helped you to be better every moment in your life,person who import good things on you, how stay with you in (bad & good) moments that person you want the best for you, who was happy when you get the victories because that is that things that you received and help you to make that same things with that person,we need to know who really is our friend.

-

Friend is who really want to support you how really wants good things for you that friends is that care you to do the true and better things.

16005A45A20A,"There's 90% of people in the world that wants to be someone in life, but some people never had the chance or some people just gave up on school,and now they regret it. In the past few years, there has been many teenagers that go to college and try to do a career that they think they are able to work with, but after few days of studying for that career,they see that that's not for them, and they just drop out. Our schools and our parents have been trying to help us decide what we really want to do in our future before we enter college, that way we don't do the same mistake some people did. Now schools have a program where you get to choose what career you think you are interested in, and see if it's really what you want for your future. That way you have a chance to either stick with it or look for other career you could be interested in.

I want to be able to see if the career I want to take it's really for me or not. I think whatever career someone chooses, it shouldn't just be for the money, it should also be for some that makes you happy and that you are going to be able to stick with your whole life. My friend Generic_Name graduated in 2014, and he started to attend to Generic_school. He studied to be an architect, but the only reason he wanted to be an architect was because he wanted to help his family out with some money. Generic_Name was struggling to be an architect, because it was a lot of math, and he wasn't really good with numbers. What Generic_Name really liked to do was to fix cars with his older brother. He couldn't do it no more, he dropped out of college, and started working with what he knew was gonna make him happy. He worked for a whole year as a mechanic and saved money, that way he could have his own business and help his family out. He finally did it, he has his own business now and whenever there's a problem with my mom's car or my dad's car, we go to him. This is what I'm talking about, he never had the chance to see how hard that career could be and if it was going to make him happy. I don't want to do the same mistake, I want to know what I will be getting into and see if that career really is for me.

If you give me the chance to go,visit,and learn about the career I'm interested in. It does not only help me to see if It's really for me or not but I will also learn new things I didn't know and those things, they could help me in life. I want to be doctor and to get there, you have to go through a lot. As right now, I'm attending to a nurse class where I learn the basic things like knowing how to do blood pressure, learning body parts and learning a lot of vocabulary. I also know three languages: Spanish, English and Latin. After finishing my nursing class, I want to attend to Generic_school, because I've heard their doctor and nursing class is the best. The only reason I want to be a doctor is to help people out and be able to keep them healthy without any problems. My dad wanted to me to be an electrician because that's what he is, but I told him that wasn't really my thing. He taught me all he knew, that way if i ever have a problem with that, I would know what to do. One time i went to a friends house, and it was already 9:00 pm. Out of nowhere, the lights of the all house went off. So what me and my friend did was, turn the flashlight on of our phones to be able to see. His parents were freaking out, because they knew it was late already and there probably wouldn't be any electrician that would pick up the phone. I told my friend that this i could fix this because my dad already taught me how to do it. I called my dad to make sure I was right, since he's the one that knows everything about it. I was able to fix it and turn the lights on again at my friend's house. They thanked me and were surprised for knowing all this kind stuff already. Every career is important, it might not be the one for you but you will always learn new things that will help you in life, like it helped me.

There might be people that say to just look for a job where you get paid well, or people that say a career is too much because you have to study a lot, so I'll just go and work as a waitress. Yes, it is important to try to get a job that pays you well, everyone likes to make money. But if you don't like the job you are doing everyday, then you won't ever be happy with what you are doing. That's why you have to find a job that's really for you. You do have to study a lot to have a career, of course you have to. Because you are not only helping yourself, you are helping other people that's going to need your help. This is why it's important to know what you really want for yourself.

I am writing you this letter because i want to know what I am going to get into, I want to know if this career really is for me, because I want to make sure I stick with my decision. Like I said before, if It's not what I want, then that's okay because I've learned new things that will always help me in life. If it's not for me, then there's always another way, you can look for other career and see if you are interested in. I know there's more people that probably want the same chance as me, but I hope you choose me. It's not just because the money I want this chance but also because I want to help people out. I want an opportunity to see what I really want.                                                                                                           ",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5

1846CE5F244D,"community parks, state parks, and national parks provide a wide variety of interesting activities. Write about an enjoyable way to spend time outdoors. Using specific details and examples, explain why someone might find that activity enjoyable.

First of all, Let say that you don't really see your family that often, You can take them to the park when they come to your house so you all can spend time together as a family that you don't really see. You can talk to your brothers if you don't see him him or her that often you can take him or her to the park ride around with bikes, Maybe go for a run to burn some calories down so you can stay healthy and in a good shape. And if you have a problem with someone in your family the park is the best way yo go and talk it out, Why because you can smell that fresh and clean air from the outside world you have time to think what you really want to do and talk to your self, If your a religious person that likes talking to god Im telling you go to the park you can talk to him you get everything of your head and you don't think stupid stuffs, Because some people when they are mad or they are sad they just go on their room and lock them self in their room that's not good because you are not breathing clean air like the outside world and the firs things teenagers do is yeah I am a bad boy I am going to smoke with my friends, I ask you this what benefits do you get from doing that? The park is the best way to go and take your stress out and clear your mind.

Second If your an athletic and you don't have money to go to the gym or you don't have time, Don't worry about that I have one way for you to stay healthy and on shape by going to the park look there is so much stuffs you can do at the park you can go for a run, push-ups, curl-ups you can Stretch your body, And the good thing is that you are not breathing that air from the Gym and at the park you are breathing clean and fresh air. The best thing is that it is totally free and you can take anyone you want to take and you can see more people there that you don't know you can make more and new friends.

Another reason is that If the house you leave in is to small to make a party, Guess what I have the correct spot for you the park you can play music you can make a big party invite us much as people you want to invite. The good thing is that the park has games for kids to play on and other stuffs and they even have food you can go buy food they have a little lake where you can go on little boats of four people and see different stuffs. Why would you want to have a party at your house when you don't know If people are going to come and where is going to be crowded and people might want to leave because there is to much people. When you can have the park because a lot of people like the park because they can go for a walk they can spend time with friends and family and there is a lot of space there is a small lake with boats that can carry four people you can have fun and experience the park.

Finally going to the park is good for you I mean I am not going to force you to go to the park but you should go just one time and you will see how cool and beautiful it is you can go with your dog, son, or your daughter, Plus sometimes they make a little concert and a lot of people come and dance with different people and different music. And in the summer they make a little fair and let me tell you man It is amazing, You can try different types of food because people come and sell food and It doesnt cost that much you can smell the delicious food.

Great Britain is the greatest place to visit for the tourists? In my opinion, best place to visit for the tourists is Great Britain. Because, Great Britain has,the most interesting and mysterious places to visit, the culture differences, and why is visiting Great Britain is great motivation to start learn English.

Firstly, Great Britain has a lot of tourist places to visit for example, Big Ben. Big Ben is the one of the main historical places that tourist should visit first. Also, Great Britain built a lot of castles between 15th and 17th century. This castles were serving to, protect rich people or royal families from attacks, and to keep them warm. But right now most of this castles are not used to live inside because people left hem alone and nobody could keep them clean and safe. It's great place to visit to feel how people lived differently than us right now.

Secondly, Great Britain believes in very interesting type culture in the world. People are living their life with optimistic view even if they have not the best time in their life. Actually, people who lives their whole life in Great Britain has beautiful accent that helps them to make a lot of dramatic operas. All of the Great Britain history, people believed in Christianity and promoted to other people, it cause that all of their old colonies are believing in Christianity.

Finally, if the tourist is visiting Great Britain, it's a good motivation to start learn English because, right now most of the world is using English to communicate with each other, and English is one of the greatest language to start to learn. English can be difficult sometimes but every language is difficult in some ways.

1A469EB86263,"We can always accomplish if we have a time and also if we try to do more than do anything. Accomplish don't have to be all the time just when you can. For me to do accomplish more is better than don't do inactivity. I have 3 reason why I think do more accomplish. First reason is, to be better. Second reason is, do more. Third reason is, feelings. There are some reason why I think that be accomplish is better. For some of the people be accomplish is hard to the people because they don't have to much time.

First reason is, be better is because your learn more, you have more experience. We don't wait our time if we do more job if we have to do more job we doing it. We don't have to be to lazy for do more job if we can do the job. Just if we don't have to much time that will be just to done the work. To do accomplish to spend more time doing it. Whatever thing is if we have time we doing it. I work every day if I have to do more work I do it but if I don't have a time do to my work I just done whatever I am doing.

Second reason is do more. do more can be extra work done that will be nice ti have extra work done for the next day if we do the same we don't have to do more. Extra work have to be complete by the time and then dependently what do you do about. When people do extra work in their job the make more money and also they make more overtime hours in their job but no all the job are the same. For me to do more work is more easy for one think I learn more for, another think I just do extra job because I have time and I like too. To more is when we the people have time

Third reason is feelings, why feelings? feelings is because when we do more work that have to be we are satisfy. In other way we feel like when you make a goal when you done. We have emotional feeling when we done the thing what we doing it and also when we accomplish more. After you finish doing the work we feel tired but is not the same when we are satisfy for done. when I do my extra work always measure that is good. When I know is good

I say ""yes I finishing"" and I feel so proud of me. when we do something we have to be positive for every will be okay.

In conclusion, to do accomplish will be the best idea for to better extra work. The reason why the accomplish is the idea is, to be better, to do more, and the last one is feeling. what Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle it is wonderful how much may be done if we always doing""

The change to the school lunch menu is a good idea becasue this benfits the students health and education purposes.

Changing the school lunch menu would help students stay focus in class. Many researchers believes that when students eat healthy, they are more likely to pay attention and do good on thier quizes and tests. Students eating junk food will make them feel lazy and make them feel tired during class. Students will not have stomach problems during class if they eat healthy foods. Students eating healthy makes them succed in all of thier classes.

Changing the school lunch menu would also help students have better nutrion. They will be more active after school and not be lazy. Students that have after school activites like sports, need good nutrions to perform well.

Students that have good nutrions would feel good about themselves during school and after school.

Althought other students dose not want the lunch menu to change because they want to eat thier favortie cafeteria foods. This is bad because they will not have a good nutrions for after school clubs. Also they will be very sleepy in their classes and not be focused.

1E2B10DC7A53,"In my opinion, they shouldn't let students attend class from home. Students do not attend their classes will most likely to slack off. Although it is a great idea, only the truthful will attend classes from home while the other student will be in school. Students need to be in school to social and get out of their house, students shouldn't be in their bed listening to the teacher and being lazy all day. Student needs to be in school.

From my point of view, students should be in school to socialist and need some fresh air. If a student stay home then they'll feel lonely, decrease their social skills, and be lazy. Due to this, students can develop some type of mental health problems if they stay in their house for a while, also some student who is in home will most likely skip school just to enjoy their day off. Teachers should know their students more. If a teacher knows who wants to learn then they'll most likely will focus on that student but if the student doesn't care then the teacher will try their best to help the student. Therefore all K-12 students should be in school and learn.

Even though you understand my argument however, I think the trustworthy students should attend class at home. If a student shows respect and work really hard, then they would most likely to attend class at home if necessary. Although it is best if they attend in class but if they are sick then they are welcome to attend class in home as long they listen to the teacher and take notes. But if they are really sick or any emergency, than they should email the teacher to let them know. Students should always let the teacher know when they are not in school and ask the teacher's permission to do a video conference.

Without a doubt, students should be in school to socialist and need of fresh air, I do believe that everyone will be good in class and show respect to any adults. All student needs to be healthy in a physical and mental way. Students need to be in school in order to build their social skills because that's part of life, to socialist people if they need some assists or you need some assists as well. However, if there's a trustworthy student who work really hard may attend class in home. But if a student is awfully sick and in crisis then he or she will email the teacher that they are not in school and ask if they can do the work next class or in the morning and lunch break. Whether or not I think all K-12 student should go to school and learn instead learning it from home.                ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5

what are community service: is when people come together to help make the community better. helping the community is very important. i think our school students should be required to perform community service, instead of waiting for the school cleaners to take away the trash and clean up the class room at the end of the day. i think students should do it them selves. you can help taking part of community service for example: cleaning up litter, sweeping the lunch room after use, picking up used trash. community service is not meant for school alone there are different palaces community service could take place for example : you house, your neighbourhood, anywhere around you that is need to be clean. i know students have something better to do like, their homework, play video games, i think there is time for everything. and students should always take part in anything that would make their community better and cleaner.",3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0

Imagination it's what sparks our creativity. Without imagination, knowledge means nothing because we wouldn't be able to come up with anything. How we create intricate characters and stories and how incredible buildings stand tall. This is due to imagination and how we come up with such things. Take a second and think of your favorite character from any source of media. They were created because someone imagined them and brought them to life. Imagination is all around us from our stories and music to our basic everyday items. That pen on your desk was imagined up to be able to write and pass along information.

For ages people imagined stories and people listened. People and imagined plays,movies,books,TV and video games all with different stories and design. These things may seem insignificant, but people adore these stories and have been inspired. They have been mesmerized by these worlds and characters. Imagination is what leads people to create these stories. These stories have taught us messages and life lessons also. They inspire us to be best version of our self and to follow our dreams, as we see the characters do. We grow close to characters and relate with them, making these stories more special to us. Imagination gave us inspiring role models and heroes, they also gave us a childhood. How we wait to see our favorite cartoon and smile with excitement waiting for the next adventure to unfold. Imagination gave life to unforgettable characters, how Walt Disney created Micky Mouse and countless other. These characters and stories aren't just for children but adults as well. Stories of all genres exist to bring new experiences and worlds to the audience. Imagination gave us stories to inspire,scare,to make us laugh or even cry for the character. Imagination gave life to countless of stories something knowledge could never do alone.

From the Eiffel Tower to an small little house, people imagined buildings and ways to construct them. It's true you need to understand and know how to build but imagination is more important. Imagination is what let us think of such designs. Even in ancient times people put imagination and knowledge to build a house. Whether it's building a mud house or straw hut people imagined putting all of it together and put it in action. How people designed cars for transportation and made it function properly. Engineers are creative and imaginative to come up with such intricate designs and models. Even everyday objects were imagined and made to help you in everyday life. Whether it's a juicer to a wrench, people imagined these things to serve a purpose. How biomechanics creates prosthetic arms and legs to help the disabled to move again. Theses things all started as thought to help society and now are a vital part in today society. Imagination is what led man kind to create items to help us in everyday life.

Music is an form of art where people express their emotions through song. Instruments were imagined for the sole purpose to create art. Then playing the instrument led to more creative thinking, then songs were imagined and instruments added to that. Songs are written with heart and they express the artists' emotions. They are imagined and written down, sometimes using metaphors to express their emotions. People say that they can say things through music that they couldn't say with words. Being able to imagine such meaningful songs that leave a such an impact on the listener is incredible. Music speaks to people in a way words can't and the artist that make them are imaginative people.

Imagination led these artist to produce such songs and music. Painting is an other form of imaginative art. These artist express themselves by using strokes of paint to produce vibrant works of art. Even though a painting is silent people speak through them to show such meaningful works of art. Artists imagine what they want to paint and execute and you can see such a passion in their works of art. Imagination inspires artist to create outstanding pieces of art.

Imagination also expresses itself in the way we dress and life style. For the most part we choose the way we dress,where we work and what we do. When not in uniform or work clothes we choose how we dress. We imagine ourselves a certain way and choose to expresses ourselves that way. Our hair and how we choose to style it also reflects our personality. Whether it's colored,straight,curly or even no hair at all. We also imagine what we want in our lives and choose to study for that career. Our hobbies and interest also show what kind of person you are. How you spend your free time is how you reflect yourself. Our appearance and hobbies are a self reflection of our imagination and who you are. Imagination makes you who you are, and that's what makes everyone a different person.

Imagination might not seem important but it's what allows people to create stories, construct buildings, create items,produce music,to make art and makes you. We need imagination even more than we need knowledge. Without imagination there wouldn't be a way to put our knowledge to use. Imagination is the fuel of the world, it's what keeps everything going. It may seem insignificant at first but imagination is so such more. Without imagination no advancements would be made. We need imagination to do almost everything life. Imagination is what makes us human. Imagination over mind.        ",4.5,4.0,5.0,4.5,4.5,4.5

20A42E81AC2B,""" How village people get education ""

A village have a school and they are diside learning the people, they offer for distance learning. They do meeting for that and everybody agree for that. After few week start the class. Some students visit every where and they try to teach to viliage peoples and attend to them. They think village peoples learning everything . What they are need?

I think""yes"" students would benefit from being able to atted classes from home.

My first reason is some village have or had no one go to school. They just doing hard work. One day some peoples visit this village and they deside. They will be teach to them. Then, they are start the classes . Some people think it's crazy. When everybody learning they know it's good for everybody. They takeing online or video class for how they are makeing graden? how they are growing up? how they can't do hard work? First issue is how they thing about that?

My second reason is I think the peoples they don't doing any study they will be face the any problems. This why they need to study. some people thing study is bad thing of life. How we solve this problem? The people teach to them many things for examples:

1. Girls under 18 they don't get the married.

2. how control the birth?

3. They are need a nice future.

4. Boys and Girls need the education.

My third reason is I resoonse for the reasons because whole world peoples need the good educaton or genertion of future. Because who didn't get study they no how can talk to peoples. I agree for that because peoples need the educatoin. The village people now go to school and they send to child in school. They students help to them everything what they need to every daily life.

My conculation is one second, one minute, one day, one months,and one year peoples need the study or education. Because people don't get study the will be get poor. I'm agree with this school they deside good idea for the village peoples. The learning is don't finish because will leaning every day some thing new. Study can't be finished when you will be die. Also, they need to do how the students teach to them and how they are learning.

211699D25472,"I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson when he wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"". You need to show to everyone what are your ambition to improve your life, and if you don't show to the World what you can affort, do not put any complain to someone else for your fault. You always want to know what are your own limits.

First, I think what he is trying to said with "" Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" is always have big dreams bigger than you and have big ambition too. That you always work hard and know your position and show to everyone how you get there, because is not easy go to the top and keep the place, and most of the people give up, and not showing us their goals complete.

Second, do not put any complain to someone else for your fault, ehat you did, you did thinking what its the best way for you, and don't take it like a loss, take it like you get more experience in life, and its not always happines have sadness too, but always you are getting more knowledge to know how to do that next time, and show to the world how you get there.

Third, people always have challenging on their life that cause that people always want to know what are their limits, so they always push themselves to know what are their limits until they can't anymore. Then, they try to overpass their limits working harderst than anyone, sacrificing themselves, and living their pride to stay at the top or to go at the top.

21B100A503DC,"Churchill statement is right because failing in life is part of succeeding. Those obsticals you go through in life are part of who you become and how you handle those obsticals. It gives some type of motivation to keep moving forward and get to whatever goal it is. My example is when i got pregnant my junior year and when I found out i just wanted to drop out because I was still a kid myself and I kept thinking how people would look at me or what would they say, but I already had an idea. My parents didnt even support me so what motivation did I have? I had myself and my son. I took that as my motivation, yes it was difficult especially after I delivered and going back to school because I was very behind. Of course a lot of friends stopped talking to me but that just proves who's there for you and who's not. I was starting a new chapter in my life and I'm not saying having my son was a mistake but it was just at the wrong time; cant change the past though, you just have to keep moving forward.

Here I am now my senior year, eight more months until I graduate and I'm proud of myself because I am a mother now and I'm still going to school, I didnt let that stop me from getting my education and I'm planning to go to college too because all I want is the best for my son and myself; its not me I have to think about now, I have another responsibility to look after for. There are many examples of failing in life and later on succeeding but this is one I went through, I had to grow up fast but it made me the person I am today.

I mean wouldnt you have loved it if you had a chance to visit a office and learn a couple things get some tips from people that have been doing this job jobs for years. I think that everybody should get a chance to goo into the field of what you like before you even think about going in.

I think that I should have this opportunity to go visit to see what it is like learn a little from works that are doing this on a daily bases before I were get out of high school. For the reasons being I maybe not even really like it once I get out of high school after i do whatever it is to get to become a real estate agent what about if i dont love it anymore as much a I thought I possibly did back when i was in high school . I would obviously just be miserable doing something i dont even love also just wasting my time in getting all of this in place in order to get to where i wanna be and then not love it . Also If it isnt what i was expecting when i get a job in a agency it will be very dissapointinting to be working somewhere you feel like you have no choice and are unhappy with it. Thats one of the reasons I think it would get good thing for me to get a visit so i wouldnt have to go through all of that once I am getting ready to purse my employment.

Getting to visit would show me what the process is into becoming a agent, how to successes in the business not to crash and burn and to be able to become as successful as I can be in this journey . This work really interests me also because you make big bucks also seeing beautiful houses . I could maybe open even my own business of real estate agents also than Id be even making more money perhaps you could even show me how u became successful and got to be a manager of real estate agents. that would be very helpful you could show me how things work, steps you had to take to get in the passion that you are in. But in order for that to happen you know of course you would have to be open in letting me come in and learn from everybody gain knowledge from you hard working people how you are successful and all of that good stuff the ups and down everything .

That is why I think I should get the opportunity to visit and learn about real estate agents I could gain a lot of information from this visit it will help me in the future about my career how successful Ican become and all of that thank you for hearing me out I hope that you let me have this chance to learn and become a successful young girl in my future awaiting for me .",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5

A reason they have for that is that, The students that dont commit to a career early wont have to start paying bills. But I persnally Think It is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age.

22CFD6C961E3,"Some school districts allowing there students to graduate in 3 years instead of the traditional 4 year is something I strongly consider, and surely something I think we all also have to consider. Being able to graduate in 3 years not only gives you an extra year, but also gives you the proper amount of time to plan your future. The amount of time that you would be spending in school would be a year less.

Given a year, it is up to you, how you use it and what your going to do with it. Getting a job would help save you a lot of money for college. Having a year off doesnt exactly mean that you have to go to school, but instead getting a job will be very beneficial. Whether its to support your family, save money for school, or even for pocket money, knowing that you have not only time, but also extra money, will help you realize that there isnt much to stress about. Jobs also dont have to be something that is outside of school. Having a job that is academic wise or just something temporary to have the experience, will help open you up to more opportunities. Whether you are looking forward to go to college or to become more appealing to bigger organizations/ companies in your work force, having a job that is academic base will help. For example, going to coach my brothers soccer game during the weekends compared to going to a community center to fix computers during the weekends, wouldnt really open me up to more work opportunities rather than fixing computers at a community center will.

Going to college isnt for everyone, but for many is the way to go. Maybe your going for your Masters or even a PHD, when you have a year you are saving the amount of extra time that you would be spending in school. Lets say for my PHD I would have to stay in school for 8 years, knowing that I have saved my self a year even though it doesnt seem like much compared to 8 years is not only saving time and money, but also saving a year to your age. Most student that go for the traditional 4 years typically are being rushed and become stressed out by the end. Colleges will also see that you have graduated showing them your were willing to work hard to get that extra year.

Being able to graduate in 3 years doesnt only ask for patients but also for your dedication. Although you are graduating a year early, it doesnt neccisarly mean that the work load given in that year doesnt have to concern you. You would have to be able to manage your time and work hard to makeup for that year, yes, even if it means you have to give your summer break. Staying organized and knowing what your aim is, will give you more confidence making you become dedicated.

Although some may argue that this is definitely something stressful and given 3 years is not enough for the workload in high-school, just know there is still hope. There are some student that dont have enough time to even finish in 4 years. So being thankful, you should know that it is alright if you cant finish in 3 years. Having this program gives opportunities to student but also saves time. School districts should label the students that have enough credits to graduate and for those that don't, and for those that dont, they should offer support (programs/ clubs) for them to possibly graduate in 3 years. If its not possible for students to graduate in 3 years then the 4th year should just be a less stressful year.",3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5
22E55C32A973,"Have you ever woke up one morning and thought ""man I want to do my classwork on my bed"" No? me either but I sure do think it is a good idea and let me tell you why. Students have been given the chance to work from home; instead of working in a classroom. Today I will explain why I believe students should be able to stay home instead of working from school. First reason would be you will be able to work at your own pace. For example whenever you have a test/quiz during school there is a time limit and you don't really focus while working on your test/quiz you focus more on the timing but, if you were working from home you would be able to work your pace with no worries about a bell ringing when your still on question 1. But if you were to work from home you would be able to cheat on the test or not even focus on it you could be watching TV while doing the test and that isn't the best choice but, there are ways to avoid that. Second Reason I would say is avoiding illnesses that could affect the whole school. Students do have signs almost everywhere telling them keep the school a clean place, wash your hands before stepping out the bathroom, and to keep your hands to yourself. But, sadly some students don't do that ; Now that the corona virus came out everyone is starting to be more clean but not really everyone but if you were home you wouldn't really have to worry about catching anything to make you sick unless one of your family members is really sick otherwise your good because in school theres like 1,000 or more people imagine how many germs are in the air. Not saying school is the cleanest place but our janitors do clean up after us everyday for it not to be clean but I just wouldn't believe it because there are still students that don't cover their nose/mouths when they sneeze or cough and you wouldn't have a problem if you were home. Last but not least my third reason would be less anxiety about school. As a junior I noticed many people have anxiety when it comes to school you worry about your looks, If you are smart enough, the way you say certain things I could go on with what students go through now a days people enjoy judging others even with not knowing them so it is hard to not have anxiety in school especially high school but at home you wouldn't really have to be worried or stressed about that you can be your own motivator your own hype man because no one is perfect. Now i'm not 100% sure about staying home and doing class from there would work out because not all students have the same mindset some like being in school because the teacher pushes them to do their work we all need a little push in life also some students can get away with so much from home if they were do a assignment or test you can just easily search up the answers. Some of my friends have done that when their teachers post things on Google classroom they don't usually do it themselves but, at the same time there is much benefits from working at home then in school not only do you get to sleep more but you also get to basically do your thing but your own way. Students working at home can make a student independent instead of being dependent on their teachers. As a student it is honestly up to you to go to class and to focus on what you are being taught it shouldn't be your teachers job to make you go to class everyday yes we all need a push in life but not every person is going to help you out you have to be independent most times. Students should work from home because in the real world not everything is going to be handed to you.",2.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0
234F1BA430B7,"Why is it important to learn the experience from others?

It's important because you know what you're going to do or you know what you're going to see.

For example when my cousin went to another country she told me about her experience, and that puts a thought to my head of she did and what she saw. Therefore when i went to the country she went i experienced what she did and what she saw.

When your friends or family members share their experience with you, you start to imagine what they've expericenced and that sometimes leads to preparing because they've told you what they've experienced from them they can prepare you. For example your family has a thing where all the boys in the family try out for basket ball, and you ask your older cousin how was their experience went and what they did good and bad.

So you know what the coach wants to see and what he doesn't want to see that means you can show off to the coach and that can help you make the team and make your family proud and keeping the legecy going and when you can share your experienced with your brother when it's his time to shine.

Learning from others experience leads to good things like making a team,preparing,proving people wrong,improving, and some lead to bad things like you're new student and a bunch of girls see you're hanging out with a girlwho has had bad experience with them come up to you and tell you about their experience with the girl, and that makes you think she's so nice and that makes you not want to be her friend from ther experiece with her , or your best friend and you have the same science teacher but different blocks and your best friend tells you that the science teacher is very nice and when it gets time to go to your science class the teacher isn't as plesent as your best friend shared with you.

244973AE9715,"Many people are kind and do parts in helping others , what they don't know is , the act of kindness either received from or given to someone has a big impact no matter how small or big . Reasons an act of kindness can really benefit someone are , the person might have a better day just because of your kindness , the person might learn from your act of kindness and lastly , a good act of kindness can come back to you from the person who you helped .

The first reason of how kindness can impact a person is , the person whom you helped might have had a bad day or , you never know what someone is going through , they could have a hard life and are hiding it . The person who received the act of kindness might have bad a bad day or life , your kindness could have made that person feel so much better and worthy. Some people don't often receive kindness , you might have put a big smile on their face or , made their day much better . You can be seen as a person with good characters and manners , people can always depend on you if you are a kind person and do a lot to help make someone feel better with words or actions everyday , most people would appreciate you if you did almost anything to help them or make them smile because again , you never know what someone is going through . For example , I partnered up with a girl in our math class , she was crying for some reason and nobody wanted to be her partner , when I told her if she can be my partner , she said yes and sounded really happy when I said . I , of course told her what was wrong , she told me she was going through a lot at home and nobody wanted to be her friend in school , I was devastated to hear that . I told her she can be my friend and for the rest of the day she smiled and laughed .

The second reason any act of kindness , big or small , can impact a person is , the person receiving the kindness can learn from you and make themselves a better character too , you can influence a person with how you act , if you act kind and generous and , make good choices , someone is gonna learn from your words and actions . Same with if your a person who is just rude and makes bad decisions , someone else , will learn from your actions . Many people tend to learn from people in their environment , especially young people , so if a young person sees you offering a kind act of helping to either them or someone else , they can learn from your actions and see you as a big role model , people should always make good decisions for many reasons one being that young people can benefit from your choices and will always look up to you for being the person to guide them through life , many people make bad decisions around children but if you do an act of kindness , to them or someone else , young kids will automatically learn from you . For example , one day me and my little sister were in the park , playing with our friends , we saw an old lady all of a sudden drop her apples , I immediately went to the side walk and helped the lady , I picked up the apples and put them in a safe and clean bag . The old lady thanked me and told me , ""you're well mannered , thank you for your help , I appreciate it , may god bless you"" , I smiled and said ""your very welcome"" . The next day as I was going to the bus stop , to pick my little sister up from school , my little sister ran to me and said ""I sat next to this new girl in our school who was being bullied . I even shared my lunch with her because, she did not have much food at home to bring to school "" . I was delighted to hear her story , I told her why she did that , she responded ""when I saw you helping the old lady yesterday , I realized how nice you were and how happy the lady was , I decided to do something similar "" .

The third reason of how an act of kindness can benefit someone in many ways is , the good act of kindness can come back to you . For example , one day , a girl in our class came late to school , we were in our social studies class , she came and sat down and asked people if she could copy the notes , all of my classmates shouted ""NO"" .

I went up to her and gave her my notes . She was happy and said thank you , when she finished copying my notes , I went to my seat . About a week later , we were having a contest in our school , whoever won would receive a prize . I sadly did not have any knowledge of the topic for the contest . The next day , I partnered up with the girl who copied my notes , I told her about how I wanted to win the contest . She looked happy and told me she knew all about the topic , she said she could help me and I replied with , ""I would appreciate it so much "" . I went to her house after school and taught me all about the animal , we needed to have certain knowledge of the animal to do the contest in our school . The next day , I did the project and the next day ,I winned .I thanked the girl .

In conclusion , any act of kindness can benefit a person , you might make them smile , make them learn , or , the act will come back to you.

248407B5DBB2,"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" For example to run without connected to the power is not useful work. I agree with Thomas Jefferson that from doing nothing we can not gain anything. Because if we are always doing something ,we can learn from what we are doing, and we can reach the goal that we have .

If we are always doing something we will get a good result and we can learn many things. For example when I was in high school I was just doing my school works and I did not have any job or something else to do after school in my free time, so I thought maybe I can join the school soccer team because soccer was one of my favorite sport and I was always watching soccer games and I was thinking maybe I will be also a good soccer player in future too. And then I tryout for school soccer team and I did not have any experience about playing soccer and I

was thinking negative, because I though maybe I will not be able to join the team because of my talent and I did not know anything about soccer, and there were many kids for tryout with good talent and skills that they had. When it was the time for tryout I went for it and the coaches were testing, but when I got the result I did not make it, I was so sad that day and I was never going to give up because of the dream that I had. After that, two months later I join a soccer club for training and I was trying my best to learn soccer an many other skills. And after a year when it was about to start the next season of tryouts, I made it to the team and I was so happy and proud to be in the team to accomplish many things for my self and my school.

It is always a wonderful thing if we are doing something or working toward the goal that we have. For example when I graduated from high school my goal was to go to college and I wanted to be an IT Engineer. And that was not an easy thing for me,because of the expense of the college and the subject that I was thinking to study. And I did not have the budget for it,so I was wondering if I could work and make the make money that I needed for college. And the cost for the subject that I was thinking about to study in college, it was going to cost me around twenty thousands dollar for the whole semester. And my parents were also supporting me a little bit,but I needed to make the rest of the amount by working. Finally I got a job near by our house and I did not have a driving license, so I was walking to my job. And the first days of working it was a little bit challenging for me, I did not know anything about the job and it was also a new experience for me .And I had to work and accept the difficulties and challenges that were upcoming for me to reach my goal. After two months later I was thinking to get also another job beside the job that I was already working on, so I could make more money to accomplish my goal early. And also I found another job and I was working in both of them and I

had a shift of four hour in each. And I learn many things from doing my job and after a year and half I had the amount of the money that I

needed for college and finally I reach my goal.

From doing nothing we can not accomplish anything. And it is always a good time to start and it is never late to do the things that we want. And we should never waste our time doing nothing.                   ",2.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5
24B8DF4DA85A,"Be active or not active in life, those are two options that we have. There is many reason why people are active in life, but there are many other reasons why people stay inactive on their lifetime. Thomas Jefferson said, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Staying active and with determination people have more chances to be successful in life.

First of all, in reality things can't be done by them self. For instance, the first TV, car, plane, cell phone, etc... wouldnt be done with out a lot of hard work. Another example could be, the creators of all the things that we have now, they didnt stop or give up on their goals they were active and positive in the process to success.

In addition, in order to accomplish great goals people must stay active and work hard for them.

For example, the best basketball player of all time wouldn't have accomplish all the records with out dedication in the process. Another example, if Martin Luther King didn't do things or stayed back with out doing anything for the people, we probably wouldnt have the life that we all have right now.

Perhaps most important, people have more chances to success in life if they stay active and working on good things, more than if they stay inactive. For example, a hard worker business man probably have way more success in life than a regular person that instead of working hard and do things prefer to stay back and be inactive.

Some people argue that, inactivity serves a purpose. They say that, the fact that people are doing something doesn't mean that what they doing is right. This might be true; however, inactivity wont take people anywhere but to fail in life, and for success in life people must to do things constantly and dont give up.

Without dedication and work people wont accomplish nothing, no matter the talent or the skills that they might have if they dont do nothing with it. People must stay active and fight for what they wish and want, without that life wont take you anywhere.",4.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5
25597135F582,"Student's that don't want to be in high school for four years, plan on finishing earlier than others. These student's have already gotten their credits and just need a few more to finish. Students want to get a early head start than their other classmates, they have enough credits to finish their junior and senior year in one go. It's a great idea for student's to get a head start on college and the workforce one year early.

Students that get an earlier head start plan on starting their careers while in college. The jump from high school to college is way different but it's a better step for students. A friend of mine had finished high school earlier and got to start college earlier and now their life is going to start because they went on the right path to start their career. College's offer programs to student's to help them get their degree like Master's or Bachelors degree faster so they can achieve the career they were trying to achieve. Many colleges offer this program as one of my family members is going for their Master's and they are going to get it a year earlier than majority of their classmates.

Some students have already been into the workforce already and now they would like to finish high school and become a full time employee instead of a part time employee. Student's that are still in school that already work cannot make more than 40 hours due to the fact that they are still under the age of 18. Full time employee's make more than 40 hours but some of those employee's still go to school due to the fact that they are balancing school and their work life. Students's that are in school are either a full time student and part time employee or a full time student and full time employee. Some student's in school majority of the time they work put their schedule as everyday at a certain time or they work weekends.

Students finishing high school early is benefit for the students that would like to finish early because they want that head start in life. They want to start college so they can get started on their future career and get that dream job. Students want to become a full time employee instead of a part time employee so they have more hours and get better pay to go to college to be a full time student and full time employee. For these reason I agree with this statement that it's a good idea to finish high school early to get into college earlier or into the workforce. ",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5
25BFA95D04DE,"Everysingal student has worked hard in school. Showing they can push hared without being praised, even if it takes a year or two. Praising a student every time they get a good grade or accomplish a small paper isn't fine. I believe working hard builds true self-esteem comes from achivment because it shows in the students hard work, they aren't going to be stuck up or self centered, and they won't expect anything if they stopped getting praised. Although achieving your work and getting praised once in a while does feel good.

When a student works hard it shows in their work and in their face. Many students have shown their best effort with out getting praised. The student should have to put their own interest if the student really wants to accomplish their work. If the student is getting praised all the time what are they really learning about hard work? They would think everysingal good thing I do comes with a prize.

There are many students that are stuck up when they receive a good grade, those students have probably done good work but there could be a student that has worked the same but didn't get a good grade. There are some students that get their feeling hurt when they don't get a good grade and their class mate rub their grade in their face. Those self center students are closed minded, instead of helping the student out they hurt their feelings. Some student like to keep their grades to themselves.

If a student gets praised all the time they will expect something in the end. The student wouldn't do it for themselves they would do it for the prize. They will not learn about real hard work, they would think every good thing comes with a prize. And thats not the case. Feeling good at the end and knowing the student has worked hard with no prasing is great. They feel better about themselvs because they know now they can achieve something without the prasing.

In conclustion I believe true self-esteem comes form hard work, feeling good about your own grades and not expeting anything from anyone when you have worked really hard. The student will show their effort in their own work, and will look for their own achivments in school so they can feel good about themselvs. Thoes are the student that should be prasied.

25F1B2374A32,"Have you ever felt like you needed the guidance of another person? Many people have felt that way. It's never bad to ask for help or guidance from another person to get through things. Although having your life runned by someone else, seeking guidance isn't such a bad thing, because for some people making a big decisions on their own could be hard and stressful, and you could also be guided into a good and healthier life style where you are making better decisions and ideas.

A reason people should seek guidance is because for some people making a big decision on their own could be hard and stressful. But having someone there with them while making the decision would be more than helpful and could possible reduce the stress they have. For example my cousin would get very stressed out when she had to make big decisions on her own. But when she had someone there with her or she asked for help she wasn't as stressed as she was when she had to decided on her own. Making decisions on your own is hard and intimating, so why not seek the guidance of someone else to help get though that tough decision making?

Another reason seeking guidance is a good idea, is because you'd be guided into a better and healthier life style where you are making better decisions and ideas. As an example one of my closest friends was going through a dark time in her life and was making poor decisions. But she found someone she looked up to and asked for their guidance. So they guided her to a better life style, where she now makes better decisions than she did before. All because she had someone to guide and help her. Guidance really does play a big role in a better life style and better choice making on people.

However one might say, ""well your life is being runned by another person."" But it really isn't being runned by another person, because you also have the choice to listen to them or not. Or that your mentor or whoever is guiding will tell you what to do or how to live your life. In some cases they do tell you how to live your life, but they tell you how to live a better and healthier life, but can't force you to change in any way.

Having your life runned by someone else isn't ideal but seeking guidance isn't the worse idea because you'd be guided in good ways such as a better life style and could be guided through big hard decision making. In conclusion I believe peoples lives wouldn't be horrible with the guidance of someone because they aren't only guided you to better your life but they are also helping you with hard decision making and getting through things.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5

27FC2D31B704,"I think its a good idea to ask people for other people opinion because people might have better thought on something, they can have different options for you, and it also can help you later in life.

I think we should ask people for there opinion because they might have a better thought. For example if you wanted to go shopping for cloths and you dont know which one to pick. People will give options of what they think and they can tell you which one they prefer more. There are variety options you can pick from. You can choose your own and ask people if they like it or not. If you dont know which one to pick between two options. You can ask friends, family, or anyone you feel comfuterble with you can get an idea which one you want more. Its always a good thing to ask for people opinion.

Asking for people opinion is good they can have different options for you. You can ask on different flavor of ice cream you can get as many options as you want . People can give you differnt opionions on what they think which ice cream taste better than other ones. different options is always a good thing to use. Its bad sometimes haveing only one option the more options the better. The more options you get you wont have problems with picking things of what you want. It is easier to to pick and and you can have what you want.

All these opinions can help us out later in life. In the future you might need help on which flavor ice cream is good. You can ask someone and they can give you an opinion which one is good. Its good to have opinion some of them you might not like. Everyone dont have the same opinion which is okay everyone can have different opinion on different types of things. over time you might need an opinion on something and you can thing what people have said before or you can ask someone to help you out.

Different opinions and thoughts can help you more in life and you wont have problems with picking things. its good to have different opinions on different things that people give you. All these opinions people give you can help you later in the future and different kinda of opinions. I think it is better choice to ask someone on thier opinions and get an idea of what other people think about different things.

280F4A13DE2B,"I think the principle should go with option of letting us use are phones during lunch and the other school brake times instead of the option of not having phones at school at all. Many of the students have there own cell phone and some students might need it for different occasion's to communicate with are family, parents, or guardian. An example would be me i needed my phone to contact my parents during are lock down that happened not to long ago, i sent them a message from my phone to tell them ""mom we are on lock down so i cant leave the school i don't know what time we will be out ill call or message you when its ok for us to leave"" that really helped me to communicate with my parents and if the principle went with the option of not having phones at school there probably wouldn't have been any way to have told my parents we were on lock down. I think going with the option of using phones during lunch is a good idea, it might even stop students from using there phones during class when there not suppose to, knowing as soon as there done with class and they leave they have time to communicate with friends or family. It can help students grades and can stop students from not paying attention to the lesson or teacher while they use there phones. Students would enjoy using there phones and knowing they don't have to hide it or get in trouble for using there phones during a break.",3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

I thinks for this that is the very better idea, I am agree because when you do somethings. When you doing somethings may be this can helping for another person that is great for all the time. This support we can something better because you know make some great this can effect for some people,and can i'm disagree,for example when yo doing some helped to hospital may be can bring some support with you pay 20 dollar for month. This helped to hospital is something you know about a greatest accomplishment because you do this idea about yourself.

That is contantly trying of yoursel. This is always and without interruption or can be again and again without end, and me position this issue is real education, so you do somethinmg in then you have you doing a discussion. When you has something to doing, then we have to do a discussion about what is the greatest accomplisment this that happened because we have to do something individuality, and make a support, for example we have to make some better we know about this how the education is the great discusssion because everybody have to making a reasons and bring the support, and this position I am agree beccause when you spoke about of the education for all the children the is some sure.

The greatest accomplishmnet can be something bad you can reporting a situation. for this things you do some this is for yourserf because you make some can have a discussion, and you making the be better accomplishment or laern more about for this experienced. For instance what is right of accomplishment is the we tying to make something such as a blessing somebody the is the greatest accomplishment because you making very good for some people this is agree,and the is action you doing and support because you make is good reasons. Also for some specific example about is the a greatest accomplishment is when all the people in a country are developed the is of better accomplishment because the people of for this country to make a dicussion, trying,talent for that country can be developed. Also something accomplishment we trying to be better because sometime is so difficulty to do here is we have to used the talents for support the idea for develop.

Sometime of the talented is having to be more considerable because we have to do a particular effort, and support this position on this issue. I feel the position when tying to make about something right you are make some greatest accmplishment agree because we trying helped and then make a reasons specific next doing a discussion and desiccion.

I make every day to be more better for any class. and tying to helped ssome people this is a constantly that make, when trying to make something is so difficult because I has to make a discussion but for a dicussion all have to talent this is statement about individuality to making. However i has to used the talent. Also in the life and future all the people have to make bigger greatest accomplishment this is that people can be more great life.

The greatest accomplishment somethings factor that have in the life. Also may be can sometnhing has to resolver with a discussion. Also this thing have to be the greatest because we trying to some to do and support.

The first impression is something the you can't change later on the future,because is something the you make or the other person make. On your first impression you need to give your on personality you done want to act different, because then later you going to want to change and you going to make the other person think different about you his going to think you not the person the her knows.

The first thing you show on the first impression is respect. The way you act around the person, things the you do when you with the person, The language the you used around the person.

Also you need to be helpful for the person, show the person the you care about it. Help one each another, and work together. Be happy around the person, your first impression is the one the is going to show your personality.

Also have the person talk about her life. Let her know you wants to know a little more about her, tell her if she need something let you know you always going to be there for her. Make her feel like she won one person not the she have something the is going to rude is life.

All those small things the you make wrongs on the first impression can cost you everything the you ha've been done. Just try to do your best because the first impression is the one the make everything happens.

The attitude is very important in the case , you have to give your best at the first impression.

If you do everything good on your first impression, you going to be fine. Just be happy, respectful, and have a good attitude. All this things can make your first impression wonderful for you and the person you meeting.

But also you need to show your original personality because you don't want to show your opposite.

Everything you do on your first impression is the one the you need to keep with the person, because you don't want the person to leave just because you show something different went she meet you. want to be the same because the first impression is the one the make the relation work.

For those people who think the first impressions don't matter that's a lie because everything you show on the first impression is the one the support your relationship.

If you did everything good one the first impression and now you not doing the same as you stared your relationship is going to be pretty bad. But if you did everything good and you still doing the same everything is going to be fine. Just do your on personality and you don't have to worried about change your first impression.

The way should agree with the first impression is the you can't change what you make at the first impression. Even if you trying to change you always going to remember you ready have goon through the first impression so you always going to have on your relationship.

All the respect, help, and attitude on your first impression is worked you just need to bring all your personality together and your first impression is going to be the fantasy.    ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5

29BB45AA907C,"Have you ever asked for advice? I ask for advice when I don't understand something or when I need help. When I need advice I ask multiple people so I can get everyones opinion. When I get multiple peoples advice I choose one that will be best for me. What I'm trying to say is that asking for more advice can be useful.

One reason why I think asking for multiple advice is good, and helpful because people could be going through rough times. People ask for advice sometimes because maybe they have family problems, and they need help so they go ask people for advice. When you need advice you don't have to ask one of your family members, you can ask a teacher you trust, your counselor, or your friends. Out of all the advice you get you can choose one advice that you think could help you the most or you can use all the advice people gave you and try them to see if the advice would help. There can be many different reasons why poeple ask for several of advice.

Second reason of why I think asking for multiple advice is good. Another reason why people ask for advice is because they could be making a club, and they might not know what to do. Club members can put up posters, and ask people to write their advice or opinions on what they should do to make the club better, and more interesting. All the advice they will get is going to help them make the club better and they could get more members added to their club. When you ask for advice from people their advice can make things better.

My third reason is, sometimes you are so nervous for a test so you go ask for advice from people. When you want advice for a test you can go to your teacher and ask them for advice, or you can also ask other kids that have took the test before and they can give you some good advice since they took the test already. Advice can really help you if you are nervous. When you are nervous and people are giving you some advice their advice can help you calm down. Sometimes you can also give yourself some adviceb by saying to yourself ""you got this"" or ""you are going to do good on this test"".

I say that asking multiple people for advice is important. It's important because all the advice people give you can help you through out the day. Always ask people that you think can give great advice and always ask people for advice when you need some.",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5

First technology can not be good in some places, for example homes many peoples has many issues at home. Because, kids are obsessive with the new technology. Also technology is addicted to many peoples and it can cause biggest damages on their lives; for example if you use a phone for to long it can burn your eyes no in that moment but it will make you lose your vision. Also,

technology can make peoples lose their mind.

Next schools, should not be allow to use technology because students can cheat easily using the technology. they can not learn how to write by hand because technology will do everything for them. Also students can use the technology to bully other and to share inappropriate thing for example photos. However, technology distract students to their classes.

Finally, technology was reported once of the highest causes of accidents in the roads. Because people were using their phone during they were driving. Also people use technology to make frauds; for example to get in the banks accounts and get money from others peoples accounts. However, people can use to get someone personal information or to hack someone accounts.

In conclusion, people is getting addicted to technology because new items with more technology more faster. also technology can ruin the peoples life because if you use to much it can make you lose your vision. and technology can make families separate. a lot of people lose their mind cause technology can be a really horrible      ",3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0

Another reason why i agree is that you don't have to lie even more to cover what you already lied about. And it its hard to catch up with Ur lying it can also get confusing and you can get caught lying to there face. The last thing is if you get caught lying it can cause more problems with the person and can lead to more issues. It can also help the other person to trust you. If the person trust you you dont have to lie to them so it wont hurt there feeling. Also you can lose someone trust or lose the realashinship you have with them. It can also hurt a lot of other people that u care about. lying can cause you to look bad in front of people. And id it hurts there feeling you can solve them because you told the truth.

2B69ADAD868C,"""some people may say that growth does not depend on doing something beyond what they have, for it is not unnecessary.'' However, that is a fallacy idea because we all know that is not true. Wise people believe that doing something beyond what they have will make them grow as a person, both physical and mentally. Unless people try to do something beyond what they have already mastered, they will never grow, because growth comes from doing something that someone has never done before, it comes from trying out new things, boost up our confidence and makes us progress.

Doing something beyond what we have already mastered, will make us try out new things that will help us move on further. trying new things is the only way we can know what we are capable of. for example, i remember trying out something new which was beyond the things i knew, i felt different and new. the feeling that i felt was growth. Trying is what makes us know who we are and what we are capable of.

If people do not do something beyond, how do you expect them to grow, when growth is defined as making progress in what someone does in his life time. growth is producing new things that has never been done before making someone realize how good it is to do some that is convince and improve in our skills. Not doing something beyond is as good as not growing. doing something beyond will boost up someones confidence in doing things. the ability to try new things beyond what we have already mastered is what we call self-esteem that alluded from confidence. How would someone have confidence when they do not try new things.

Thinking beyond the box , makes some people become dogmatic with affirmative thoughts, because they would always want to do something with diligent. how do can someone expect a person with fallacy ideas become dogmatic? For example, how can someone define a person who does the same thing over and over without changing? It becomes irritating and unpleasant. growth comes from the things that we do beyond what we have already mastered.

Some people might say, "" it is not necessary to do somethings beyond what you already have because, having excess of something is not good.""however, that is not right, we all know that having something in excess will always push us to doing more things. for example, Trevor Noah once said,'' nothing is enough not until you die from it,"" meaning nothing will never be too much. The more we try doing something beyond the more we intend to learn. we all learn from doing something that is beyond our imagination.

Unless we try to do something beyond what we have, we will never grow, because growth comes from doing something someone has never done, it boost our confidence, and makes us become dogmatic with positive thoughts. doing things beyond, will always produce good results at the end, such as, advancement, making progression in our daily life. I firmly believe that doing something beyond what you have, will boost someone's confidence because each day i try out new things and all i get i enthusiasm of doing more.",2.5,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.5,2.5

2BAF09F7004D,"As we know the modernization through the years is bringing us new advances in technology. One of the most important and positive effects of use of technology is make life more easy for everyone. I mean, the use of social media is given us a lot of way to communications no matter where we are; the facilities of communication and information on time are essential to accomplish many task. The complexity to communicate and create different way to interact had making a great way to a efficient communication.

First of all, the use of technology is currently having big impacts in our lives. It is changing through the years the way how the humanity is living. There out are a lot of brilliant brain creating new advances in technology everyday. The expansion of the new advances day by day is given us a renovation of our life style. The interactions between everyone through communication using different devices such a computer, phone, iPad, etc.. The principles of those project of advances created and expended by people expert in technology; the've been implement the necessity of technology in every single places. It can also influenced our mental and physical health; depression and anxiety are common nowadays so there are website to providing helps online. The variety how we can combine knowledge in technology are infinities. That is one of the main reasons.

Secondly, we are breaking all the limitations that we had before. If you are trying to communicate and if you were in large distance was limited because we did not have those resources such a Mobile devices. So now, we are currently, sending messages or texts, even we can do video calls on live simultaneous. This factor was not possible without the technology. Everyone is connected around the world. Those limitations are breaking because all the different social media:

Facebook: One of the most famous and popular website to post, share videos, photos, websites, links.

Twitter: This app is used mostly to post personal thought or opinions.

Instagram: To post and now with new implement of sources for marketing.

Gmail: It is one of the most popular account to mail. It is like Email but it is more modern.

Email: is mostly used to messages.

Blogs: is used to shared a personal version. It can be about life style, hobbies. Anything you want.

YouTube: This is a platform with the purpose of given us videos some of them can promoting companies.

In addiction, one of the important advantage is the facilities to do everything we want, when we want, where we want. The use of technology in school, colleges even work implement the easy way to accomplish everything. Now days, school bring to their students computers with the the purpose of advances in every single student to do their homework/assignments in home with all the necessary facilities. They want to give students information through books that you can easily get online. In the pass, it was impossible because you had to go to the library and get the permission to read a few books. So, now with the technology we can also use the technology with the purpose to sell or buy things online. Amazon is a good example of success marketing in the world. People buy things on Amazon because they do not have enough time to go to the store and buy their stuff. The platform of amazon is giving us enough details about those items that we want to buy. The majority of shop stores or companies have websites. This is creating a red of new jobs. Some people can work even in home using any device because technology is making that possible. Sometimes, the use of technology can be optional but something is a necessity. We have to adapt to the new modernization. That is because technology.

Although even, there are some statements about some negative effects of technology such a limitation of communication, I can prove with real facts how the technology facility the interactions of contact to other people for example: group chat, messages, Facetime, live videos. Students can be connected with their classmate or vice verse even with their teachers. They just have to be connected. Social media is creating a direct and indirect connection to others, I mean the students can have conversations about projects or assignments through their phones or any device. The use of technology can be fun. We can use technology in video games and some of them have communication though microphone and we can really interact with our partner. We also can extend the communication and interact not just once or two as many as we want. Technology is given is entertainment. Sometimes we just want to be in our conform zone and that is okay. So it's up to us if we want to work, play with somebody else or by ourselves.

It's true that we can decide if we want to work, have fun by ourselves but the technology bring us the opportunity to interact with others.

Finally, the use of technology is part of our lives already. We can deny the use of it in our daily activities. A simple example: If we are going to get a job, mostly of the applications are online. Every job is associate with technology. The use of them created good benefit in everyone. The effects of technology depends with the purpose we are using it. If our purpose is to using the technology to good benefit, the used of them will be successful either the purpose is about good or bad things.

""Every action, have a reaction"" Isaac Newton.

The results of our good action will always have a positive effect.

I can concluded, all those positive effects are making our work more easier. The use of technology in our society is impulsing us to be betters every day. All the results of hard works by every of us. The innovation of those advances are creating new mechanisms in our routine, new life style and all that is because we are smart enough to created technology, everything started from us. The majority of people is using technology with good purposes. The world is doing better because technology.",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5
2BFB0A8F50E1,"Once there was a girl named Generic_Name. She was a great student, always doing her homework, and studies hard. Generic_Name was a negative person, she never aims high on any of her exams because she always have a feeling that she will never pass. At the end of the month Generic_Name get her results back and she passes all her exams. Likewise, the great artist Michelangelo once said, ""The greater danger for most of us lies no in setting out aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" Some people prefer to aim low and achieve more, while other people prefer to achieve high and achieve more. The greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark because people should be positive, have goals, and believe in themselves.

The greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark because people should be positive. In my life I hate staring new things, whenever I start something new I always think negative and I will not achieve it. At the end, I always achieve what I had started. When I started to think positive on what I am doing, I always end up happy for what I aimed for and achieved. People should be more positive on what they're aiming for. When people start to think positive they will feel very sure and confident of what they're aiming for. For this reason, people should not aim too low.

Also, the greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark because people should have a goal on what they're aiming for. A psychology study have been done on people to test if goals work. The scientist that did the study explained why everyone should have goals, and how having a goal could lead to one do a lot of things. The scientist also explain that a goal is the purpose toward which effort is directed. Having goals to aim for something too high should lead one to achieve a lot of things. For this reason, people should have goals and aim high not low.

Additionally, the greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark because people should believe in themselves. In the TV show The Good Doctor, the main character Doctor Generic_Name had a surgery and there was only 20% chance that the patient will die. Generic_Name was a great doctor, but he didn't believe that he could do it. Until the patient was about to die, so Generic_Name had to do the surgery for the patient to live. The surgery went very well, and the patient went home healthy. The main character in this TV show didn't believe that he could do the surgery, and when he had to do the surgery it went well. Likewise, people should aim high and believe in themselves more to achieve what they aimed for. For this reason, people should believe in themselves more.

If people aim too low and achieve their mark, then it's dangerous than aiming too high and falling short. As the great artist Michelangelo once said, ""The greater danger for most of us lies no in setting out aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" The greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low and achieving out mark because people should be more positive on what they are doing, have steps to achieve their goals, and believe more in themselves. Thus, setting our aim too low and achieving our mark is dangerous. ",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5

For example one day i was assigned a project with a group of other students , my group was full of slackers and i had to do it all on my own.

I put in all my time and effort and dedication into it , my project ended up getting the highest grade than most of the other groups. ive been told i am a risk taker ,I do things others would consider to be rational or crazy. On a different project I worked on

I chose to do the most challenging one , no one would take it because there was a lot of writing needed to be put in and a lot of researching and information needed to be discovered .

I

am not afraid of challenges I like them I like expanding my knowledge and going above and beyond ,showing others my potential . I

am open minded when it comes to others and my ability to work well with others and communicate with them will blow your mind i am not afraid to talk in a crowd or present and i take joy in working with others and helping them out . I am very open minded when it comes to people and my education . although there might be some ideas we dont always agree on ,i accept it and respect there work ethic and give them my a hundred percent attention and try my best to understand them , and their point of view and where they are coming from . One time , there was this new kid at my school he was coming from Brazil . Know one would speak to him or make any interaction with him. so i took the liberty in talking to him and making him feel welcome into our school and letting him know he was not alone that he has a friend,that was me , after talking with him for awhile i then tried to understand and put myself in his shoes he was a scared boy coming to a new country for the first time with his mom and not being able to know the language and how different the lifestyles are from here and Brazil was very difficult for him and is family so i wanted to help . i made him feel better by taking some time and teaching him English now he speaks English fluently and he thanks me for all of done for him . this was one of the reasons why i love working with others and helping others out .although some people might say that i am a little too straight forward ,others will say that they appreciate my honesty , therefore i should be chosen to have this opportunity in taking this internship because i would be a great candidate for it and it would really mean a lot to me my goal in life is to be successful and get my family out of the projects and into a better lifestyle and this internship would be a step in the right direction . i promise you , you wont regret it .",2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0

Do you think that we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or dose inactivity also sever a purpose. I feel like that we do a lot if we are always doing something and not inactivity. while some may argue if inactivity have a purpose in this I think not, I believe that we can do a lot and accomplish more if we are always doing something because you might want different options from different people, two or more people work better then just one, and you don't have to worry about doing all the work on your self and be worrying about finishing it on time.

Firstly, do you think having different options or opinion would help you accomplish more things? In my own opinion I think having a different opinion and opinion is better why, because someone else way might be better or faster to finish on whatever you are working on secondly, always having a second person while wanting to accomplishing something is better. why because one person might think differently then the other. Like if you worked with someone that was form a different country or state and they did the opposite of what you where doing but it was much faster you would like to learn how they do on whatever they did to finish faster. work could be faster and earlier accomplished by doing it and working it out.

Lastly, accomplishing on whatever you may be working on may help you and the person that you will be working with. I think with accomplishing work you could discover something new or something you didn't know about, and might be good that you would like to share it with you priers and other important people around your area.

In contrast, some people believe that that not being inactivity would help you better you self and accomplish more but I think not. Why because, I believe we accomplish more if we are doing something and working on it because it might get you somewhere in life or better you future and help you in the long run. By sitting down and doing some of the work might not get you as far as the person that accomplish it and will be so much better then the person the accomplished some of the work. This is why I believe doing something and learn more will you more and accomplish more in the long run.       ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0
2D940E7F240C,"Do you think that schools should extend the school hours for 1 hour and 30 min? I agreee with this plan because it would help students education.

It can help students with their education:

The teachers would be able to explain more to the students so they can understand properly. Teachers can help educate the students by using the extra time to do more projects. The teachers can read more books with the class so they can be good readers and writers.

It would give students less days of school:

Students can get more relaxing time and come to school with a lot of energy. Students can get more time working on school work/homework at home during the weekend. Students wouldn't have to worry about going to school on the days that the school chooses to skip.

It can help students can get a lot smarter with extra hours:

The students can get extra time to do homework and trying to understand everything during the extra 1 hour and 30 minutes. The teachers can take the whole class to the library to check out or read books with the classroom. Students can have an extended gym time to get rid of all the energy inside them so they can learn and obtain all the information from the teachers.

I think that the extra 1 hour and 30 minutes would help students with education. It can really help the students because they get more time on their weekends and it gives them more time to study,work on homework, or finish a project. Should schools give more time for the teachers and students?",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0
2DE38160D46B,"I don't believe school should follow in businesses footsteps and do the four-day school week. I believe that school should stick with the five-day school week. Because it would be better for the students in the long run.

If school keep the five-day school week there would be a lot of benefits with that. like if students have five-day school week there would be so much free time for students to do whatever they want like take care of responsibility, after school clubs, homework, study. And free time is way more useful to students.

Now some can argue saying that if school had four-day school week they would have more time because they would have a extra day off of school. And that true but there a catch with that it only one extra day off like say if you were in a club and you meet on Thursday then you would have to show up to the club later because school was longer now of course i'm using that as an example. So if school did have the four-day school week then yes you would have a extra day but like I said before there would be a catch to it.

Now even i'm not going to lie and say that five-day school week is the greatest thing they have there. They do have there down fall. Like for starter we have five days where we have to show up to school. And also school is long on enough with the five-day school week. So yea... five-day school week do suck too.

In conclusion, I believe that school should keep five-day school week and not the four-day school week. As I believe that it is better for students in the long run.    ",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0

We have to work for what we want nothing in this life is easy, All the people need to take a decision in life but firts we need to go to school and then graduated and look for a job and like that we are going to know more about life and make decision and kowing more about life but we always need the endorsement of our parent's.

2EB94A444839,"Some schools offer an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Schools think that it is a benefit that help students who don't want to go school or if they have diseases, they can't go schools. Taking classes in home or schools have some similar benefits but not overall benefits.

Although, I think taking classes from home have benefits and not because some students have health problems and it is not a benefit because students can't learn good like in school.

At first, taking classes from home can be a benefit because it helps students who have health problems like students that have problems to walk or different disease. Also, for students that their parents don't let them to go for problems. For example, if students who have arthritis, they can't go to schools because they can't walk. It would be better for they because taking classes by online or they can make a video conferencing with a tutor. They can learn about all classes they want to know and it would be a benefit for their future because they will get a diploma that will be help for them. Also, it can be a benefit for students that had problems in schools like fight with others students. Those students can take classes in home with help of someone or by online. In this way, they can get help and learn things without go school.

Moreover, I think it is not a benefit for students who don't want to go schools because if they don't like the schools, they will be doing whatever they want because there won't be a teacher who tell them what to do; and they can't learn good because there are no one who explain them the class. There are many students who don't speak English and they don't want to go school but they want to learn. For example, I can't speak English so good because I am not a native American, so if I don't want to go school and want to learn the language, taking classes from home would be hard for me because in home I will learn slower than schools because in schools are many people speaking English and in home I just hear one time at day. It better if I hear English the most of the time because I can learn so fast because I will make friends to help me. For me, taking class in schools is better than home because now I go to school and it is hard even if I go to school. I am improving the language with help of teacher and friends.

In conclusion, taking classes from home is not a hundred percent a benefit. It just have some benefits for some students. For some students taking classes from home is hard because they don't learn too much. Overall, if I take classes in home or school,

it is something relevant because even if I am in one or anther place, I am learning something. It is not a thing of other world. It is just for students that have the purpose to learn and be someone in life. Going to school help me to improve my life each day. Each day, I can learn something new and now my language is improving because I have people who want to teach me and I am a stronger person because no one can laughing of me because I am learning.

2F7B0CE01B4B,"People who take decisions with guidance from experts and authorities have a higher chance of making a correct decision then others, although many prefer going with his or her own instinct or idea. Seeking guidance helps to see from a different perspective, which could allow for a better choice to be made. At some point and time we all need advice from someone who is experience or would like to know what is there perspective of another person, even though may think that they need to make decisions themselves without anyone's advice or opinion.

Taking decisions is a tough thing to do in general, but seeking guidance from experts and authorities can help you make this decision with less frustration or confusion. For example, we seek advice on a daily base from our teachers, following our parents foot steps, but we rely on our own thoughts, we listen to our elder closely because they have more experience. People who lose sight of seeking guidance usually end up making a wrong or bad decision. Most people tend not to think about the cause of what made this decision come back or the effect it can have on others. As for, Someone who seeks guidance it is likely that they have gone through the same situation or something like your situation and can help you make a decision that can help you but also consider the effect it may have on others. As a result, with the advice of someone whom is more experience can bring a positive outcome.

Decisions are made on a daily bases from when people get up to when they go to sleep. For example, If someone has to take a decision some may fall into pressure and that led to take a decision that may not be the best and can have a negative outcome. When asking someone with experience there can be various ways or choices given to or ways to approve the situation. They can also give feedback on a decision someone was planning to take that could work out but also, could have been something that effected the person who was making the decision. As a result, If the person who was making the decision had not gone to get feedback or advice the choice of the decision could have been a decision that made to another decision allowing the decision process to be repeated and stay with a negative effect until that person has asked for advice from someone with experience.

People who make their own decision get ready for life guidance could help in difficult times, although they think that It Is smart just going with the idea or instinct they have it is also a good thing to ask for someone opinion or advice. Because, they may not being seeing the bigger picture or maybe they are not seeing the pro's and con's or the decision they are going to take. Asking for advice is also another way to assure that what you are going to do Is right. Therefore, whenever taking a decision it is best to ask someone for advice because it is likely they have gone through the same thing that someone is going through. ",3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

"".

Secondly, working by yourself and focus about you, and your own goals will help you to get your goals very quickly, because if you do the same thing that the people is doing, you will stay the same like them and lose interest about what are you doing and be an ordinary person.

Those are real problems that happens in every schools,so to avoid this problems i think art class should be elective.",2.5,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5

I think is great idea that the student must B average to participate in sports because it would help student there grades and benefit or learn more. some many kids all the world want to be sport famous player. and another reason is that they have to do their homework , study for their test and participate in class so that can play any activities they want or dream about that they will be come one day. getting B or A average in every day i would be awesome because some o]f the student don't believe that they can do they work and get good grand to they can play the sport the like to be come on day.

327AAC23CF5D,"On my Opinion i think is a good way to the student that they can take classes on online or on video chat is a good way to do it, because some students sometimes some of then they live so far of the school so they dont have other way to educate they self and i think is a good communication to learn.

Is a good benefit because is a easy way to do it, easy and fast and is good too because sometimes some days is snowing and when is snowing all school are closed. And they close the school because the students can not trasportate to the like that because the streets are freeze and really complicate to transport to the school.

If i have to take classes on online or video chat i will because more easy for me and is not difficult to learn on online or video chat. And because i can have more free time i can do more things and i can have a job.

And think too for some student is not good because they dont have the opportunity to have a computer t do they classes online or they dont have internet is difficult for them. Is a good option online classes but not for all students some of them are benefit and some of them dot.

Only classes are a good reason to use because is a good way to cominitate in a long distance, but Free online schools, have to be free all schools online for all students they dont have to pay nothing.

The time if they take online classes they they go not miss nothing because they can star when they want.

On my oponion is a goog way to do it.     ",2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0

I can be saomething that can help you to make your grades better because if don't planned your paper can cause you a lot of problems because when is your turn comes to writte. you are not going to be ready so the teacher is going to look at youu and she will be upset with you for example. if i don't planned my paper in time i can get in travel too because i an not doing what the teacher tell me to do so thats why you have to prepared in time before you get in travel because you are the one who is loosen point's not the teacher becuase she is telling you what you have to do. but if you decide not to follow the rules is going to be a problem.

One morething is you planned your paper on time you are doing great because planned your paper before writing it is something good the teacher is gonna be happy in you will get better grades. another example of planned your paper before writing is the information you have to writte is really important you don't ganna miss the information so thats why you have to be prepared in be ready for what is going to come.

32B2D5592E1D,"This teens manual I talk to talk about expectation. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

The first I ready to talk about some expectation. That's great to some students learning option to take some class in home, for example, some people do others things to help in home one example is he/her work in some place to help his family. Other example, regularity students nope have the opportunity go to the schools because the students things they not equality or things he/her can't do anythings to learning. I support the way to some teachers or one person is working to schools or some people have permission to teacher to go the house the person nope lost any classes they provide.

The another reason, Responsability, for example,

the place where I born people need to walk a lot distance to go learning and graduation some teachers sometime they go to the house where you live to teachers somethings to you. Other example, some time the people nope have transport or some people not have money to pay the transport to go schools. To graduate or learning more you do a lot things to graduate, however, if you put you responsibility you can do a lot or things to learning. Always the people is intelligent to great in school they can obtain beneficial scholarship to helping you and the family.

Reason of this teens. People take classes the way online, some examples, a lot people taking that's way because some people are elder; but they things is better to graduate because he/she work and others things. Some people things that's is more better for then I things that's is great to do both side. People can helps another person or example some reason why he/her taking that's journey to graduate. Always one person in class is coming four or less days to schools the attends is so bad students things is better go to work that's why a lot students take that's route. Some students don't matter anythings about the school, however, students particularity not a lot both some person things bad.

Next reason, offer to learning to night is better too, for example, some people things that is better option too, however, not a lot person have some opportunity to attend classes in home in the morning or late. A lot students take the opportunity to finish the school online. Person take that opportunity is because they have another weigh, for example, they go to work or stay in home to do nothing about his life.

That's great to some students learning option to take some class in home, for example, some people do others things to help in home one example is he/her work in some place to help his family. The place where I born person walk a lot distance to learning and somethings to graduation some when teachers sometime they go to the house where you live to teachers somethings to you. People can helps another person or example some reason why he/her taking that's journey to graduate. Some people things that is better option too, however, not a lot person have some opportunity to attend classes in home in the morning or late. My options I take the position to learning or finish my high school online, because that's really great to explain another person your experience about to finish school online. Always the person things somethings they not have good ideas to his life or something similarity. Opportunity great things for the person have major action.

Great take both ideas in this teens.  ",2.5,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.0
331760E7A5CB,"John Lubbock, a famous writer and well known for his master peaces inspired by many others such as friends, family, and other famous writers. John Lubbock once said ""Do we choose our own character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control?"" it is a very outstanding move, because 86% of the writers use their experiences, knowledge and everything they have known as a different way to interpetrait, and make a book.

Most of the people decides to choose their own character traits, this is due to how their parents treated them and how their childhood was, all thought it is different when someone has had a rough childhood and yet they decide to be a good person, this, this is being different to decide to be different then the person that has caused pain or sorrow to someone, that is moving on for the best, moving on for what is right; on the other hand we have people who do not agree with this, if there is a good side to something there also has to be a negative side is the balance of the universe and the bad side, or the people that can not move forward let the influences of many others affect their point of view of all the situations upon them.

Those people are hurt, full of pain and shame to something that they can not escape from, those people need help because who verdicts that they can escape from their past for a extended period of time. the people who tend to have a bad personality is either because of their past or their present along with the males according to a researcher in Harvard university 78.48 of the population believes that being a male means that they have no right to show their emotions, to be heartless, to be cold. women had fought for their right to vote women fought for their freedom and men are still men. the male population decides to be quiet and dont let their emotions to affect their significant others.

The people have fought in many wars, conflicts and yet there is not for sure that there is equal rights, All of the generation Z are saying ""equal rights equal fights"" but yet nobody see those equality traits women want their freedom to be exactly like men to look just like men an yet the real men are unable to show emotions and feelings without being judge or lynched.

So why did this British politician Lubbock said ""your character will be what yourself choose to make it"" because everyone has their own personality and everyone faces their own challenges along with their own problems, men can not be like women because men will get denigrated for it, and women are always free to do what they want because they will judge everyone that is against them.

33AF50FB5ED9,"Some schools have an after school homework club where students and teachers help other students with homework. I think that a homework club would be beneficial to students because it could help with grades, it is not mandatory, and could help with teaching skills.

Homework is a staple of school an students hate it, so why not get some help with it. Most students forget about homework and get a bad grade because of it. Why not get help with homework and remember any other home works you have to do. With a few good homework grades they could pass their classes.

Students all have different ways of thinking and learning, and why should their learning be all the same. If every student had to go and take part in this club the more introverted students would be more tired out. If the students are tired out they are not going to learn anything and that effects them in a bad way, but the homework club is not mandatory that is why it is not a class that we have to go to every other day.

Some students have big dreams, but don't know how to get to them. If someone wants to be an anthropologist, the study of humans, they will need to be smart and brave enough to publish their findings. A homework club can help make trusted bonds and encourage people to talk and speak up for themselves.

So many schools have a homework club but not many people know about it and are failing because of it. I think that a homework club would be beneficial to students because it could help with grades, it is not mandatory, and could help with teaching skills. I hope that this essay will have you consider putting your child in a homework club.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0
33CC5A37AC8C,"This prompt is talking about if we are choosing our own character traits or is our character formed by influences. First you can choose your own character you just got to know about the person life in what the person did back when he was a teenager in what the person became when he start getting older. In my opinion choosing your own character would make you realize about things that happen back then when everything back then was really dangerous for example they had slaves,mudered people, treating people badly, people been racise and more that people did in we still have on this day because people dont want to listen or they just dont care about what they are doing with there life like can we atleast have peaceful without seeing peoepl dying or taking childrens from there mothers. As you can see life from back then was kinda different for example mothers would marry their own children they would have children with their own child they would force you to marry a old man that you dont even wanna marry or have kids with a old guy that you dont even love this why its good to do your own character because you be searching for information that you dont even know about in it be very interested.

First of all you have to include for information about your own character or if the character formed by influences beyond or control by anything many characters be having there own influences in you gotta find it out to see about or if they are controlling anything for examples like a kingdom,slavery. and being part of a war. As you can see when been through so many wars in some characters be soldiers or a leader of a war to teach his soldiers how to fight a war when they get into a war. For example british soldiers has fight so many wars with alot of countries they either fight for stealing food or because they own them money they do not want to pay them back or because they have a little issues going on between them in they fight to solve their issues.

As you choosing your character you can be creactive with it like you can put somemany things that you need like examples, reasons why you choose this character, get ideas for your character , give alot examples find anything you can so your character can have so many information that it is need it for your character. choosing our own character might be a little hard but we got to find a way to get all the information for it so we can start writing about them in how when find this character interested in we got to know alot of things that this character you are doing has a good information and you want to be curious about.

This quote or prompt helps to figure out about a character that you would like to talk about in what to know about it to see if it helps you later on, in to see what they did to help other people about everything that they went through in this help the students to see that been on a war it is not easy because you are trying everything you can to be alive like searching for your own character it is very interested because you want to see about them in learn alot about the in how they did everything they could to help eachother in to see how we fight for the equal rights alot more thngs that we know now.

My conclusion- how to choose your own character can be easy for you to write about in to find alot of things and important thigns that you would need for your character when you are putting your examples to a five page paragraph about how this character do alot of things in his past and to see if he still doing ,more things now in then. In by you choosing this character would make you realize alot of things in how everything happen back then when people was just trying to live and survive.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5
349FF2E7D179,"Although, setting a good example by your behavior is helpful to others, there are other ways to set a good example. Talking to people and persuading them to do good is influential, you can save someone's life by talking to them, you can help someone be successful by talking to them and influencing them to do good helping them take the right path to becoming successful, seeing someone fail knowing you could've spoke to them and influenced them on the right path would suck; I personally would feel horrible, sometimes all it takes is a couple words to influence someone. People don't always pay attention to your actions, people pay attention when their spoken to, when you talk to someone one on one it's so much easier to get their attention rather than you behaving good in class for example. Actions can determine the way you change someone's decisions, the way you behave can set a good example to other people but ask yourself would you rather have someone talk to you or you go off based on how someone else behaves?

Confidence in yourself is also a good way to influence people, you need to be confident in what you're going to say to the other person, you need to be assured of what you're going to say to them. In order for you to be confident you need to genuinely know that person in order to find ways to influence them. Once you talk to them and get to know them better you can go ahead and influence someone, it isn't always how you behave there are plenty of ways you can influence someone. Confidence in yourself is important because once you're confident everything will go smoothly, find out what the person likes and dislikes once you have that in hand you're good to go. Honesty plays a big part when it comes to influencing someone, why? When you speak with honesty you won't hesitate in what you're talking about, you won't feel guilty of lying because you're speaking the truth. Respect is also something you should when influencing someone, when you show someone respect the connection of the dialogue increases and the other person will be interested in talking to you.

Determination into influencing someone is probably the most important thing, when you're determined into doing something it's because you really want to do it, nothing is stopping you from doing what you're determined to do. When you're determined into influencing someone you feel secure in what you're doing, that's when confidence kicks in determination and confidence are somewhat alike, determination is when you've decided to do something and there's no turning back, once you feel determined influencing someone will be easy, especially if you know the person well. Decision making on yourself is important too, you can't go off influencing people to do wrong you need to do a self check and ask yourself if you're ready to influence people, you have to ask yourself do my actions match what I say, when influencing someone you want to influence them to do good not bad.

Preparation, you have to prepare yourself before going off to influence other people, why? Because you can't go off influencing people if you're not prepared to do so, do research on how to positively influence people, practice it with friends and family. Influencing people isn't easy, it takes a lot of practice, determination, confidence, respect and just getting to know the person well, once you have all those qualities you're able to go off and influence people that need help, people that need someone to talk them through, there are people out there that rather have someone talk to them and influence them on the right path rather than watching how other people behave.

Behavior isn't the only thing the only thing you can do to influence someone, to influence someone you need to be prepared, you need to have confidence in yourself before going and trying to convince people to do things how you tell them to because sometimes we feel like we're right but we never take the time and think if we're wrong or go back and see what you can improve in. Make sure you're on the right path so you can ahead and help someone else take the right path with you. Go ahead and influence someone just remember that your behavior isn't the only thing that people look at, people look at your qualities and how you approach them, make sure you do everything correctly and you'll be set.

My opinion is that I find it a good idea to have a homework club, because when I was in 4th grade I went to a homework club and what I did there was of course work on homework but if you finished early you could finish work from later on that day or on things that you could do on the next day and I would always rremember I would be ahead on every paper she assigned to the class because I already completed it! When I didn't do homework club I would sometimes miss fun friday because during fun friday in order to play you must have all your work done and be caught up. But when I joined homework club I haven't missed one fun friday game!

Although many people think that your own influence can be the best way, i believe there are better ways to teach people the right path. My mom mother never yelled at me before, she is always nice with, because every time she starts to even think about, she remembers her father how she was always mean with her, as much as she wanted hated him she told to herself to never treat people the way her father did, So even if my her father wasn't a good Role Model, she was still able to get better as a person.

When i was younger my Brother and i would play video games, but i always had to sleep early than him because i was the youngest one. I never wanted to sleep but Brother always told me that: ""if you dont' sleep you won't be able to talk and see anymore"". He did lied to me,but it was for my own good.

3741D275F8BC,"Some people think that taking classes from home is a easy way to study without having to leave home. While others think that students would not be able to learn as much as they would attending to school. For some this is a big deal while others justify this as a modern way to study. Technology could be helpful for some but not everyone in terms of studying. Most people think that schools should not adopt such way of education. People say that this is not the best way for study. The reasons people say that studying from is not a good way to study, is because students would not be inspired to do their work,not everyone has access to internet,teachers would help the students more in person That through a computer.

One of the reasons people are saying that studying from home is not a good idea that students would no be inspired. Meaning that being studying from home they would not have the same environment as in school. Assisting to school would help students to focus in what they do. They would do better seeing other students working. Walking around school during free time and seeing projects made by others students could help students to be more creative. Talking to others students and sharing experiences would make students to put more effort. People say that an inspired mind creates great things.

Another reason people argue is because not everyone has access to internet. Either due to economic or others type of reasons not everyone counts with access to a computer. Having some students taking classes from home while others who also want but can not because they do not have access to Internet does not seems good. Some students have to work in order to either pay their bills or buy things that they need and can not afford to have a internet source. There could be paces where getting good

Internet connection could be tough because of the location or weather. This issue have people saying that access to internet is a problem when it comes to study from home.

One more reason is than teachers would help the students more in person than trough the computer. Talking to though computer is not the same as talking in person .People say that students would best understand things their teachers teach them in person because they would explain with more details. Some also say that interacting with the teacher would help students confidence and learning. Some teachers have different way to teach and help the student to fully understand the topics. Students would experiment best learning by having their teacher in front of them or by their side.

Meanwhile people still argue about this issue and that should be a way to solve it. Attending classes from from is not alway a good idea beacuse students would not be inspired,not averyone has acces to internet,and teachers would help students more in person.

One reason that I think that is best to change the school lunch menu is that it could eliminate bad eating habits. Students can learn to eat without being tempted to eat junk food at school. Another reason on how you can switch the food is by substituting the schools junk food by exchanging it with something much more tasty and nutritious food that could lead into healthy eating routine to all the students.

Some students say that they disagree on changing the school lunch menu.

If were to eliminate students favorite school lunch meals; it could lead to them not to eat or buying junk food outside of school.

3814F9116CD1,"Well the business that I want to visit is about hospital or pharmacy,and now I will try to convince to get the permission the manager of the business.

Hello sr , how are you? I hope that you are good , the reason why I am writing this letter is because I want to tell you or ask you or get the permission of you , if I can visit your business? Well I have some reason ,why I want to visit your business :

First I wanna visit your business because

I am interest and I wanna learn more of your business, because I want to work or have a career in my High School , probabily may you ask why I am so interesting of your business , but the answer is this is because one day I was at my hause playing soccer with my friends, and after we done to play, my mom call me that was a mergency at my sister hause, so I drived so fast that I can , when I was there , my sister had a heart attack , so we took her to the hospital , so after the thirty minute was nobody there who can attend us and the more time that we was spanding more bad was my sister , so I was so angry with the hospital service, so we didn't want to continue weating in the same hospital , so we went to another hospital that people said that is good hospital , but real was that there was the same thing , so my question was where are the doctors? why nobody attend us? my sister is almost die after 30 minutes a doctor came to us to attend my sister , now my sister is good she has no problems with her heart , but when the doctor done to attend us , I asked him a question , I said why all the hospitals take to long for attend the people?

and he said It's becuase we don't have many medicament to attend all people who enter sick or with serious problems also he said we don't have a good suply for attend the people who came very sick or almost dieing, also we don't have many doctors in here, that why we are slow to attend the people.

well I was thinking about all people who die because in many hospital don't attend them, but sometime the people don't see the problems that happenning in the hospitals ,also many doctors don't get a pay , but they still working because they see the needs the people have.

well I thought that may be I can be a doctor who save life and help people who need it , that is why I am interest in this business or job.

Second reason why I wanna convince you to let me visit your business it's because I wanna be a doctor, and learn how talk to sick people , and see what things you use to emergency , also I want to have a good aventure , also I wanna meat people to make new friends , my second point is a little be friendly , because in your business you have to make friends to help or you can help them, like sometime we don't know something how do it , and may be your partner know how do it, that I am trying to explaim is that if make friends in job or business is to work problems that you don't know together, but if I make friends in the business it's to work , not for play during the work..

Third reason I want to convince you is that many people or students wanna explore certian occupations , I select this one because I wanna learn about your business, how they work ? what type the rules is in your business, and how much you pay , what days we have free, all the normal things that we know that I have to learn , and also I want to know, how many days we work by week? .

Fourth reason that I want to convince you maneger is that your business is the best one and I wanna learn everything of your business and know more everyday and , you know what? when I was little my mom asked me that what I wanna be when I have more age or what are my dreams , everyday my mom asked me the same questions and I said I wanna be doctor the person who save life who help people and my mom told that if I put all the me , also I tell you a short story , One day when I had five years old , I was in the school , and some bad people that they only like to play around and make people angry , one day I was studying and one of those kids started to annoying me and teld me bad words , but he told me one thing that I never I will forget is that he told me that never I will have my dreams in my life, that I will looking for but never will be real, and I started to think about it and I was like sad because I thought that if that he told is real, if I never find my dream, what will happen with me ? what will be my life? and one day I was thinking in room I said I never give up , I will fight for my dreams , and nobody teld me what to do , I just will follow my heart for everything , the point of this short story is that never give up if have a dream looking for ,don't let people who make you feel bad , don't listen negative people , just do it wherever you want to be or what want you that the people says when you die or something like that...

fiveth reason that I want to convince you that let me visit your business, is that many people have the chance to explore or visit a business but some people just don't care or they try but , if they can't make real , they give up or they just move to another job or another dreams, but it's not how many time you go down , if no how many you get up, for example: I want to visit you business because that interest me and that why I am writing this and give you many examples of me and another people is because I want to learn if you give me the permission, I think that if let me visit your business, I will have more interest and I will have more emotion to be a doctor that is the work that interest and I will be honest with you all this that I wrote is for have your permission for I can visit your business and can know things that I want to know or see things that I never see before , also I want to tell you that , if you give me the opporttunity to visit your business , and hope that you can let me visit your business if is like that , thank you for take a little of your time to read this , I hope that you have a great day.",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,2.5
3816B67C0B31,"When working alone, I agree that it is more time saveing and benifical because. You are more focuesd and consentradedon what your are doing. So when working on a job or school profect, you can gain experiance on working alone. You are also more indipendent when working alone, and that is helpfull when gong to colleg or getting your first job. Others can distract you and waist your time when working as a group, and you'll end up doing all the work . Ending up with a bad score in your grade. So because of this , people should be able to consetrate on their self , and do their own work alone when the time comes to do so.

First of all, working alone can make you more independent .So when you grow up, and leave off to colleg. Your not going to have any body to leach on, so you should be more consentrated on your self then others becouse. No one is going to want help you on your work. So from being independent, you gain that self confidence, and experiance of working alone. From this you are able to do your own choices. That allows you to get a job, or buy stuff that you want.

Second of all, when working alone. You gain a better understaning on the sudject insted of others opinons confusing you on what to do. Independent work can make you understand what your doing , and get a good score at the end or a higher paycheck if its a job. Other may distarct or confuse you on what the sibject is your doing. For an example, You might be doing a battery replacement on car. you would read instructions on how to do. then see an example on what to do, but from that point. the instructions is diffrent then what your trainer did. You might be confused on what your about to do, and then mess put at the end. Others may tell you that your doing it the wrong way, and distract on what your doing. SO working alone may save you time, and be more consentrated on replacing the cars battery, and finishing the job.

Finally, working alone can make you more focused insted of being distracted by others. You should focus on your own work then copying the same thing as another student. THat student might no bo corect and you are going to end up with the same failure grade as you stident you copyed from. Or when working in groups. Some students may be lazy. Leaving you with no time left, and making you do all the work. Sometimes others may have a different idea on a subject, amking you both fighting over witch one to do. Or some student may be playing around, making lots of sound. making you distracted, and not finishing the work you were supose to do. It is better to work alone because it will help you fous more, and get a good grade at the work you have done.

In conclusion, working alone can save your time, and make you independent on making your own choices. It will also give you that confidence of working independent, so you dont have to ask other on what to do. Working alone is just a good skill to have when you go off into your own life adventure. When you are able to do your choices ehter if its good or bad. You are more independent and responsible of doing your own work, and choices of what todo. ",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5
3821238FE334,"""I don't need to go to school for to learn new things, I can learn the same things in my home"" Some students believe that is not necessary go to school to learn because they can attend classes from home. Some schools offers distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. This is a good option for students whose can not come to school for their jobs or their kids but, they want to study and to get a High School Diploma. The majority of people assure that students need come to school for to learn but, they are wrong because students can learn the same things at home. Many students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

First, Some students can not come to school everyday because they have a full-time job and their parents do not support them. For example, Many students do not have the same opportunities than others students so, they have to become independent. As a result, they have to leave from their homes and to find a job so, they sacrifice to study because they don't have time to come to school. With this option, they can go to work then, they can take their classes at home after work without to feel pressure by their responsibilities.

Second, This option can avoid the absents for students don't like come to school. For example, Some students don't like come to school and they prefer stay at home because they are attacking by schools' bullies. These students feel more confident in their home than in the school and, they believe that this option is the best way for to solve their school's problems. They also prefer this option because they are shy and they don't like to speak or to do presentations in front of the class by the students make fun of them.

Another reason for this option can would help many students is the students have kids and they can not come to school by their kids because they don't like that another person take care their kids and they prefer stay at home with their kids than come to school. Attending classes from home is an excellent strategy for students whose can not come to school by their kids because they will can take the classes and to get a High School Diploma without to leave their kids with someone else.

As you can see, Many students would benefit form being able to attend classes from home because it's a big opportunity to finish their High School even if they can not come to school frequently by their jobs or kids. It also helps students don't feel confident in the school for schools' bulliers or their feelings.         ",3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5

39929B24673E,"The success is something that everyone gets one day. Some persons don't success, because they maybe don't have the opportunities to success. Others persons don't success because they don't want to success, they don't want to be a impotant person, with a perfect job, or house. Success sometimes have something bad; to get success, in jobs, or in life, people go throw a lot of bad things. I agree with Churchill's statement, it's a true statement, and so important too.

First, people have to have enthusiasm, if people lose enthusiasm they breakdown, they deteriorate. Failure make some people more weak, and others so hard in thinking in perfect things for there life. Failure is something that every person have, or they go throw failure before. People can failure in jobs, people get fire from there jobs they failure.

Second, failure plays a amazing role in the pursuit of be better; However, when people failure to much, the perfects things come after. In peolpe life something chance when they go throw to much failure. They think different way, they see the thinks differents. When people failure, they start thinking in different way, because they go from failure to failure. People maybe think that they are not going to be a respect, or a important person, that's why they think like that.

However, some people failure a lot of time, but they don't care they try again, and if they failure they try again, they don't stop trying they don't loss enthusiasm.

Example: A person go to a school, to find a job like a teacher, he want to be a english teacher, they went to the main office to talk with the principal. She said, "" We don't need a english teacher in this school, we already have one, and he is so amazing in his job."" The teacher went to the other school to find job. He went in, and talk with the principal, she was so nice, and she accepted him in the school as a english teacher. He was so nervous, and so happy to hear what the principal said. He did not loss enthusiasm, the first school he went they tell him that they already have a english teacher, and they don't need another one. The second school accepted him, and now he is a english teacher, because he didn't loss enthusiasm. He failure in the first school, but he success in the other one he went.

Last, Some persons are amazing to failure, but others are angry, or sad to failure, there is different types of persons. Some they like to failure, some they don't like to failure. All the persons failure in one time in their life, but they maybe success when they failure. Some success and they don't failure anytime. Enthusiasm is something important that any person have not to loss it.

Success is something in your life, but people go throw a lot to get success, they failure and failure, and than get success. Some people don't success, because they don't want or they can't. Once people success, others are going to success too. A person success everyone success. People have to not loss enthusiasm to success. Some people success and don't have failure? Some persons success with not having failure, but later in life failure comes. ",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,3.0
3A94013B23DD,"""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing,"" a quote from Thomas Jefferson, meaning the more active we are, the more we are able to accomplish. Although many would believe being active would be the obvious answer, there are reasons as to why being inactive may allow us to achieve more. By being inactive, we have plenty of time on our hands to accomplish things, we have the energy to accomplish more, rather than constantly being worked up and doing something, and we also have time to brainstorm ideas.

Constantly doing something does not give us the time we need to accomplish goals. By always have a fixed schedule or always having to do something, we feel as though we connot risk wasting any time by trying to achieve something. Having those few extra minutes out of the day can allow us to create or focus on our hobbies, which then can get us to accomplish things. For example, over the summer, my dad decided to take time out of his job to focus on his love for plants. He then decided to make it his goal to bulid a garden, by taking time out of his very fixed work schedule to do it. By the end on the summer, he had accomplished his goal; just from taking some time off.

Always doing something causes us to lack the energy we need to accomplish things. When constantly doing things and working, we are too tired to achieve anything, because we put all our energy into everthing else we do. We become fatigue and restless when constantly doing something. For example, my mother is always doing something; she goes to class, goes to work, then comes home to clean and cook. She is never able to accomplish anything because she does not have enough energy. When we constantly work, all we want to do after is sleep, rather than causing us to want to accomplish things.

By not always having to do things, we are able to new brainstorm ideas. We can brainstorm goals that we would like to accomplish. When always doing something our minds are focused on other things, rather than focusing on acheiving goals. We dont have time to sit and brainstorm when we are constantly working. Our minds cannot focus on multiple things at once, meaning it does not have space for other thoughts of accomplishments.

Even though many people think that constantly being active helps accomplish more, it is not always true. We can accomplish just as much, or even more when being inactive than always doing something. By being inactive we have the time to accomplish things, we have the energy to achieve more goals, rathan than being tired and restless, and we are able to brainstorm ideas without other thoughts in our minds to distract us.",4.0,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.0
3AD5BFDC11E4,"People who want to success in life have to failure more than once without loss of enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is important because is what keeps you doing what you want to accomplish. I strongly agree with the statement of Minister Winston Churchill.

I personally think that in life there is always up and downs. For example, when i got bad grades i always think on what am i not doing right so i can fixed it. However, to success in life you have to failure more than once but you have to know that there is going to be obstacles that are going to bring you down but you don't have to let them stop you because you have to think on what you want to accomplish or in what you want to success. If a person losses interest in something they want to, then they're not going to keeps going. In conclusion, you have to fall so you can get up and keep going to the goal.

Loss of enthusiasm can not give you success in life. For example, when you have a goal and there is many obstacles is because your close to get to rich it. However, you can keep doing what you love so you can accomplish the goal that you wanted. Although, there will always be somethimg that try to stop you but you don't have to let stop you. In conclusion, if you don't loss enthusiasm you can do whatever you want.

To success in life you have to think positive and act positive in front of anything that want to stop you. Although, you have to show then what you are capable of and what can you became if you don't loss enthusiasm. However, you have to failure so you can have a lesson and you can learn from that lesson.

3AFA78FFFC15,"So I would be talking about how people should sign up for something at there own school because people should do something they love thats my first reason. Everyone should be doing something its not like your doing it serious but sports is hard in my opinion because you have to be really good at that sport thats my second reason. Not to be on the electronics all day that would'nt be good at all compare that doing something all the time. But people should do something in there lives because you only live once so do something. Thats why agree to this so people would'nt all that because if you really love something or sport then you should make dreams come true so your good at it that is all I have to say about people should do something activity at school or sport.

Reason number one love something then do it because people should believe what they do also some people dont believe in there self they just knock there self down like believe that your good at it. What if there really good at what they do like people should follow there dreams by being good in that one activity or sport they love. We need really great people to do something dont be doing stuff you really dont like because u dont need to do something it dont make sense. This paragraph was about how to do something you actually wanna do and believe what you really love about your school like dont just sit down and relax like do something in your life its apart of life too.

Reason number two everyone should do something in there lives should'nt be lazy because that would'nt take you no where when your all lazy and stuff dont do work or anything. Do sports and activity so your body could be healthy because a lot of sports will take you some where. Probably professional sports that would be really great for you like big time. Be active al the time so your could help your own body it could probably grow like that and thats all I have to say about my second reason.

Reason number three is not to be in electronics all day long because its a distractions to others you need to practice what your doing in a activity. Be home all day you should really play outside with friends or make plans during the weekend because it would be fun for you and your friends. won't have much sleep at night because if your just distracted about being on your phone all the time you'll probably be tired in school or even at practice or after school. So you shouldnt be on the phone all day your play outside go to the movies or chores doing something doesnt get you bored all the time. So this paragraph was about you should stay off your electronics all the time not all but sometimes just go outside and play.

Thats all my reason I hope that a lot of people try something that there good at. People try something new in life because life is'nt easy at all but you just got to fight for it and be at anything. We all should try something new it would be amazing for other some people got people to look up. To so look up to someone its good because there probably a great person with a great heart. You should look up to others because other people made a big accomplishment.

3B81809AA132,"""Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something"" yes people accomplish more when they are doing something. I believe that when people put in the effort to do more things that, it could help accomplish more for them in life. The reason why people accomplish more is because since day one they've been working hard and every chance they had of doing something productive that it would help them get to where they need to be in the future that they would take it. They knew that at a point of time when they get a job that they would have to take care of their parent when they older. This is why our parent's always push us and tell us to do better in school because they already been through our situation and it took them the hard way to learn and they don't want us to learn the hard way they want us to learn the easy way so that it would be easy for us to get a scholarship.

Back in the old days when our parents were growing up they didn't have no technology to learn they had to struggle to learn, they didn't have no bus to take them to school like how we do now days. But back in the old days is was easier to get a jobs and it was easier get into colleges because all they needed was a GED. But now we need a Masters Degree, and a High School Diploma just to get a job that pays good enough for us to live by yourself and to start a family. Now it very hard to get an academic scholarship because now you need at least a 3.8 grade point average (GPA) to get an academic scholarship. This why we need to be always doing something so that we can make our parents happy and also make ourselves happy that we've made an accomplishment.

These are the reasons why i think we should do more, push ourselves more to get to where we need to be in life as a teenager because our parents can't keep telling us the same things over and over for us to listen we should just listen the first time so that we could make them happy and take care of them as when we get older and into our adult stage.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5

Another good thing of haven a good attitude is that help to face problems. Sometime face problem with a positive attitude help to see solution. There are problem that we think does not have a solution but there is always a solution just need to be positive a figure out the best way to solve the problem.

First of all,school prepares students to face up and go against the real world,some students may need at least one more year in school to get their mind set for their future. Staying the extra year can make the student focus more on the classes that they're taking. If students decide to only go for three years, they can forget about sports or any after school activities they want be in. They will have to put all their effort and energy into passing their after school classes.

Second of all,students can be more independent. Students learn how to manage time to do work and extra activities. Students can also learn how to be more reliable and build up their confidence on doing things on task and on time. By doing the three year only, they cant take breaks and if so the students wont have enough time to rest their bodies and be able to do what is asked.

Some may argue,that students staying for three years are going to have enough knowledge to be able to take on the real world. However,students that have four years would have a more since of what they are going to do after the four years have passed. In conclusion,students should stay and have a better understanding of what is going to come up next.",4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5

Some people think that is not necessary be always doing something. They feel that they need to have some extra time to be with their family and be a person that always is doing something will take away that time. In my opinion is more satisfactory be always doing something because the more you are busy doing good things or thinking and what you can do is a help to not get involve in horrible things or and drugs, you will have the opportunity to be able to give all your family need and deserve, and also you will have the satisfaction of be a good example for your kids and a support to the society.

The people that is involve in drugs, the people that get out to the streets to steal to can survive those people easily give up and did not try to find another way to get ahead, that people who make drugs, to sell drugs or the ones that consume drugs that people are living a dangerous life they are always hidden for the police or hidden because bad people are looking for them. They probably did not have another option or just they did not effort on doing something and all that thoughts became to do what they thought was easy.

Being a person that is active and always is making new things that person can be certain that they family will have everything. That person know that their kids will have the opportunity to go to school and get a excellent education. That person know that in the house will never be short of food, clothe and health. All that and more you and your family will have if you make the right choices and keep always doing new things or always be doing things and keep busy.

But the people who is working those people are making the change for this society that people will become a example for all the kids but they will be a support a big support for the community.

There are some reasons why I think that the people that is always doing something accomplish more that the people that does not do anything. Is a complete satisfaction to know that all the you have is because yo worked for it and you work hard and like Thomas Jefferson said the determination never be end is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something.

For example, if you have a test and you have a negative thought about something, don't automatically think you're going to fail, look over your test and check for any mistakes you might have made. Then when you are done checking over the test and feel better about it, then you should tell yourself you are going to pass it. Having a positive attitude can change your life completely. It is always important to have faith in yourself. You got this!

The next thing is when you are out in public, it is always important to give a good and happy attitude to the people you see. Even if you don't know them, it can make anyone's days. It can makes you a better person just by smiling at a person. You never know if that person is having a bad day and just by giving them a smile and a few words, it can make their day better.

Another thing is if you are a teacher or parents and you're having a rough day due to a personal or medical problem, still try to give the kids a possible attitude. They look up to you and care about you. They don't deserve to be yelled at over the smallest things that wasn't even their fault. Having a negative attitude towards the students or your children is not a good thing. You might hurt their feelings or even worst think that they are not good enough for you. You are not being very successful if you keep on yelling at innocent children or even your own kids.

In conclusion, Having a possible attitude is the key to success in life because it can make you a better person and give you a lot of self confidence. So If you ever feel unsure about something, look over and think what feels right to you. Also if you see a strangers, kids, etc, smile. It can make anyone's day just by seeing that one smile.

Some of them in the group they have to support the main correcter in the stage or back of the stage. Rehearse time to make it inconvenient to be with family members to reach their accomplishment.

Finally, entertaining the audience is most important to each group member. An audience is the people come to enjoy the show, each of the group member are work hard to convince and entertain the audience. Each group member has one leader to follow their roles in specific time to make the show more interact.

I think, the wonderful job can be done working together as a team, developing their ideas and creating entertainment in their performances . And, also, their task is to gives the fans happiness and good time. Team members, families, and teachers will feel proud. I think working with a group it is more joyful.

sincerely:

3EEEF86719CD,"There are many reasons why people want to be independent. They major reason is because they want to start making their own decisions. Making your own decisions in life is a being thing in life it shows how responsible and independent you are. Some people choose to make goo decisions some choose to make bad ones. The bad decisions can cause a lot of damage to others in different ways.

Some examples of bad decisions are drugs, drunk driving, and joining gangs. these decisions can cause a lot of pain towards the people around you, joining gangs is a high risk of getting yourself killed and for no reason. once you get your self killed you did nothing but make everyone that love you cry. Then theres drunk driving you put yourself at risk as well as others that have a family waiting for them to come home to them. While you made the decision to drive after you drank alcohol you have to deal that to put others in the hospital because of the decision you made. Then you got drugs that is never good for you. The only way to stop doing them is to never start them. Your family wont be happy with you nether the people you love, but other than those there are some good decisions people make.

Decisions helps you figure out what you want to do after high school. Maybe Like what job you want to per sew or what you want to study in college or maybe if you want to start a family. All of these are good examples for making good decisions to make in the future. Jobs are really hard to find and get if you dont have experience. They are always looking for people who are ready and happy to be working in there store. But if your go to college first and youve figured out what job you want you now what you have to study to get that job. That helps you in many ways and with that you can make a family and not worry about haveing the money to support that family.

While people are trying to figure all that out we have kids that like to start trying to be independent and make their own decisions. while these kids are trying to do all that they have there family members thinking that my kid can do that on his own if you know what I mean by that basically what I'm trying to get to is that there mom and dad believe that there kid dosent need help with one thing. It shows them that there there turning in to a man or woman. there parents know that letting them make their own decisions help them think for them self and grow as a person. It also show there parents that they can handle them self when their by them selves

All these reasons show that making decisions is a hard thing to do for some people, but at the same time it shows people how to be independent in life and its a step kids and adluts have to take to move forward. Indenpendece is what people ask for in this worl and know that you have it what are you going to do with it?        ",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0
3F2941C11D95,"By extending the school day two hours, students and teachers will have more advantages to learn and to teach.

I agree to follow this model by extending the school day two hours. There are many reasons of why it will be better and will benefit us as students. One of the reasons is that we will have more time in the weekend to review our notes, homework, and things that we need help with. Another reason is that we will be doing the same forty hours of school even if we will have a four-day school week. It also will benefit teachers by increasing their time to review test or projects made by the students.

Most of the time there are things at school that we do not really understand, and a four-day school week will give us more time to study and review these things at home. We the students have the opportunity to go to school and graduate, but also some of us have obligations and responsibilities. For example in my personal life, I have to work after school everyday. And most of the time when I get home, I feel tired and I just go to sleep, I forget if I have homework or not. Therefore this model will give us more time to work and being less worry about going to school five-day week. We can concentrate at school four days and the other day we can work and do homework or projects when we have to.

Also a four-day school week will benefit us because we will be doing the same forty hours. Therefore our grades and education would not change. And I do not think that is necessary to study all five days, it is not about how many days do you go to school, is about how you take advantages from it. For example if you go to school everyday just to talk with your teammates, is like you were absent. For that reason I agree to extend the two hours of school, that way we can concentrate four days and having in mind that we will have three days to study or to keep learning at home.

Another reason of why I agree to extend the school day, is because it will benefit the teachers also. It will benefit the teachers by giving them more time to review and grade homework, projects or test that students took in the class. It also will give us the opportunity to spend more time with our families and people around us. For example, I work with my father in construction, and I almost do not see him all day until the night. This four-day school week, will give me the opportunity to spend a entire day working with him without being worry about the school for a day. And just like me, there is a lot of people who will be benefit from it.

Finally, school should be extended two hours day, that way we can have more time in the weekend to prepare for tests, teachers will have more time to grade them. And we will have three days to spend with our families.                     ",5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

Prompt

Most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and that students do not retain information easily when they return in the fall. I think summer should not change because it would have a negative impact on students; such as, not enjoy summer time.

Some people argue that there should be a year-round schools, where there would be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. Some student said that break during school year sounds good; however, they would enjoy better summer time because of the weather. In personals experiences, I enjoyed summer break better then winter break because in summer I was available to play outside; in the other hand, during winter break I wasn't available to play outside because the weather was too cold.

Student also think that they enjoy summer break better because they don't have the pressure of homework, and after school activities. I think summer break is long enough for those who need extra help, so they can attend to summer school. I enjoy summer break because it is also the part of the year where days are longer enough to expend time with friends. I also enjoy summer break because it is the only par of the year where I can spent time fishing, which is what I enjoy the most.

I think having certain of breaks during school year will make difficult for student to concentrate. Think you don't understand a topic in algebra; you get some help, and finally you start to understand it, but you realize that fall break is next week, and it will interrupt with your learning. I think thats a consequence of having certain of breaks during school year.

There should not be a short summer break because it is the only time people spend the most time with their family. I think that's the most important think of summer; spend time with the family. It is also the part of the year that people get off their stress. People is adapted with the school program and they will not like the idea of having it change. I think the society is adapted with the system that we have currently.                    ",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0

402CAB074577,"In some districts, teenagers that are in high school take courses in the evenings or during the summer in order to graduate in three years instead of four years.

Students who take the three years program do not have elective courses and have to study harder than others.

I think it is an unconscious idea to graduate in only three years instead of four. In fact, I strongly disagree with the purpose of that program.

To begin with, students who decide to study during evenings and summer will be constantly overwhelmed.

Because the academic level is more intense in colleges, they will tend to quit when they enter college and start working without their college degrees.

For example, one of my friend graduated last year after only 3 years of high school.

He used to stay late at school because of his extra courses.

Last summer, he started college.

After only two months, he started giving up by going to work at some restaurants rather than going to his classes.

I had a conversation with him last month.

He assumed that he stressed himself over the past three years and now he can not do it anymore.

Based on his experience, I realized that grinding to graduate in only three years will help some students finish high school earlier than the others, but it will not take them further.

In addition, students who decide to graduate with the program of three years and go to college or work usually lose track of their social life.

Because they dedicate their entire time on studying, they do not have time to enjoy their life and have good memories with people around them.

For instance, a few years ago, my older sister who decided to graduate with the program of three years in high school lost track of her social life.

She used to go to school every single day including the week-ends.

She was combining that tough program with her part-time job.

I could literally stay at least three days without seeing her despite the fact that we lived in the same house.

When she finally graduated and went to an out state college, it was worse because she used to answer my messages every month instead of every day.

We lost any type of affinity that we had because of that program.

It was also hurtful to see that at the end it was not worth it because she gave up after two years of college.

Obviously, the program of graduation in three years has a negative effect.

However, some say that it is an advantage that people should consider because it will help them start their career one year earlier.

I respect their point of view but I believe that the traditional graduation after 4 years is essential because students will have time to be mature before getting into the most challenging part of life.

Therefore, I still strongly disagree with that idea of graduating in three years.

In conclusion, the traditional graduation after four years in high school is crucial and we should stick to it.

Because high school is where teenagers grow in their social life, no one should break the pattern by trying to graduate earlier.

In order to protect teenagers'social life and help them grow adequately during their adolescence, I urge the authorities to outlaw the program that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of four. ",4.5,4.0,4.5,5.0,4.0,4.0

Online class are not easy not anybody can pass thats why they not meant for everyone. Being home schooled is nothing like regular school you don't have to wake early, you get to choose what time you do your work.

Not having to wake up early everyday is nice but knowing you have to get something done right after you start is not fun and specially if you not getting the help you need not being able to ask the questions you have makes it a lot harder,

you also have to try and do your best because if you fail you can't talk to your teacher about helping you make it up and helping you pass it like regular school.

If you are home schooled you missing out the fun in regular schools not talking about class meaning all the fights, all the fire drills, all the dances and friends sometimes having trouble in regular school i always tell myself i need to drop out or take online classes but home schooled is not just for everybody and probably at least 60% of home schooled students either don't finish or go back to regular school.

For example,student graduate on the university, they are not face with on the obtain employment. I think it is a good idea for student to gain the skill for the career.

On the another way, develop the career courses early, it will give student more pressure, because in this time student are still immature. if gave they more pressure,can not make students students but can make students fell repugnant.

In century twenty-first the education in United states and another countries became better that before thanks to technology. Moreover, the technology helps schools to teach their students with a better way. Now, classes are created creative and effective.

This is a program that help students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Therefore, there is a question that every body is making Is the distance learning a better option?.

As all programs, it has many advantages. The benefits of this program are following: Anytime class: you do not need to wake up very early in morning, you will be able to attend classes anytime that you consider best. No drive: you do not need drive to school or anywhere, you will skip the traffic. Comfortable: it will be comfortable, because you will stay in the comfort of your house. Work and study: you will be able to work and study at same time, because you can attend classes anytime that you want. No bullying: you do not have to suffer bullying from anybody in school anymore. Focus: you will be focus in class, because you will be alone in your house without company.

it also has disadvantages such as no teachers: you do not have any teacher with experience around of you. if you have a question, you can not ask to some else. Sociable life: you will lost a sociable life in school, because you will stay in home. No books: you do not have all the books to study. Depression: you will pass for a depression that could be caused from being locked in home.

41D9F5D10332,"I believe that students accomplish more when they are always doing something. That serves more of a purpose than not doing anything at all. Students learn more when they are doing something productive. Students accomplish more when they take action. Another reason why students accomplish more when doing something is that they get farther in life than others. Lastly they get mature and learn what life is about. That why i choose that when a students get all those thing in place the student will accomplish more that someone that is not doing anything in life in their whole lifetime.

The reason I choose that we accomplish more when doing something is that we cant accomplish something when not moving doing nothing. My first reason why we accomplish more when when doing something is that when we do something we are learning. For example in the 4th grade i was really mad at math , so I took action and practiced everyday after school for the rest of the year. I would get good grade after i took action and studied every night. What I'm trying to say is that i wouldn't have accomplish that if i wouldn't have done something. Another example is that studies show that students that are always doing things at home or after school do accomplish more than students that don't do anything at all. Finally they learn how to mange their time more better.

Students that accomplish things get more farther in life than others. For example my aunt is a doctor and she put her mind in everything that she did. For example she took a lot of test to take and study for. So what did she do she always was multitasking. Another example is that a person that has made so many challenges in life is going to understand that you need too do something for it.

Finally the reason is that students when they are doing their work they are going to understand what it means to be a adult.,and to be more mature in life. Students get mature when they start work and going to school because they start to mange their time more wisely. Like for example a students is going to work right after school and they have a lot of work to do. They make that time do do their work some other time when they have time or at work on break. Another example is that if a students have a goo example in life they will get really intelligent .

Finally students that accomplish more are the students that are doing something in life other that just doing nothing. Students that are accomplish more are learning life skills. Students that accomplish more are going to get farther in life than others that aren't doing anything. Students that are accomplish more things are going to become mature.

The idea here will be to study the pros and cons with ralation to the particular indvidual and not to the group of which she is a part. First we will try to understand the dynamics of a group vis a vis individual, then understand the various issues involved in working as a part of the group. We would also see as to how those issuse will be influencing the person, be it in the positive side or being a hindrance.

Remamber last time when you had to do your project. You must have contemplated doing it by many ways. But some thing that comes to mind very in the beginning is either individually or in a group. Every body by facto knows what it is to be individual and perform a task individually, as she is the only person who is doing the task. But what is group and how it is formed and what are the dynamics involved in it.

So what is a group, we may dedine it as a collection of several people who come togethor to do a particular task or goal. And the group form, their structure and process and also deals with how it is functioning. This aspect of group dynamics is relevant in formal and informal groups of all types. In any organisational entity groups are very common entity and hence their study and group dynamics is an important area in the study of oranisational behaviour.

Being with group dynamics let us see what exactly it is about, it basically deals with why and how groups are formed and developed. In order to explain the same many theories have been proposed.

While group work has a host of merits, it also has its flip sids. Firstly, individual students usually lack the power to control the task as compared to when the work is assigned to one person for completion. Additionally, some group members tend to dominate in terms of contributions while othors may become dormant. In this case, the group may achieve its goal but limit other students. Work well together can achieve much more than indvividuals working on their own. A broader range of skills can be applied to practical activities and sharing and discussing ideas can play a pivotal role in deepening your understanding of a particual subject area.

Being part of a team will help you develop your own interpersonal skills such as speaking and listening as well as team working skills suck as leadership, and working wirth motivating others. Some of these skills will be useful throughout your academic career and all are value.

In order to maximise these benefits, you will need to manage your group work effectively.",4.0,4.0,5.0,4.5,4.5,4.0

Student's these day's are alway's sleeping in class saying their not getting enough sleep. When teenager's are not getting enough sleep they start to sleep in class and not do their work.

4256A9A1767F,"In my oppinion people should seek guidance from expercts and authorities about life's important matter instead of making thier own desisions. A few people may not agree, but I personally strongly agree with my oppinion is very important. I belive asking and sharing our ideas lead us to making better desisions. Here are three reasons why seeking guidence from expercts and authorities is better than making desitions on your own.

In addition, confusion is one of of the most common reasons why people end up making bad desistion. A lot of people might not know what it is going on or how to make a good desicion because it is probably their first time going through a situation they have never been in. I was not in a position to make my own desistions, because I was young and confused on what was going well untill I asked someone for help,but when I started making my own desitionsions

Also, it leads you to do better when you communticate with others and gives you a better understanding on why making your desision with others helps you out more. When I began to speak out about my desisions to my closest friends and they helped me make me feel that I was not going through it alone and they always made sure that the desision I understand the desision I was taking before even making my next move. It honestly helped me a lot.

Furthermore, it makes your life less stressful. You talked about what you were stressing about instead of bottling It all up. It is like some stress relive. For exapmple, you have a big heavey backpack full with books inside and when you get some out the way, you take some books out , and the backpack feels less heavy. I would feel relive on talking about what was stressing me out when I had to make a desision, because it is hard.

In conclusion, Not only do you make a desision but you uderstand, you communicate, and you feel relived about your desision. In the end of the day you would feel not only good about your desision but sure about yourself and the people around you. These were the three reasons on why you talking to experts and ahorities about life is important.                      ",3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,2.5
42587039161D,"Do you think technology is helpful ? I think Technology allows people to do many stuff and i think its postive because that way if you have to go buy grocery you can just go grocery shopping online something else why i think it is positve is because pepole can also work from home like lets say if you work in a offiice you can use your laptop so that is what i think about this. For example when my sister feels sick or does not have time to go grocery shopping she goes online and she gets her grocery deliverd in front of the house.

Another reason why i think it is postive because lets say if you dont drive and need a ride you can download the app uber and get yourself a ride to go where you would like to go. Another reason is if you need to clothes shopping there is no worries because you can aslo go online and see what you want to buy if you dont have time to go in the store to see what u need you can always go online. something else is you do not have to go to the book store because you can read online and even check out books. you can bisically do everthing online pay your payments so many stuff these are some reasons why i think tecnology has been positve in peoples lives. Also another good reason is my grandma lives in Generic_City and now we can also facetime her from a diffreant country thanks to technology. One reason why it could be negative because if pepole order stuff and dont go out to buy somehting in the store they are not getting enougeh extracise and they are just being really lazy. Another reason why it could be a negative is nowadays pepole dont even talk face to face all they do is either text call stuff like for example when i go over my grandmas house for any holidays my cousins they dont communicate all they do is sit there be on there phones these are some negative reasons.

So these are some reasons why i think technology is positive nowadays. Another good example is when i go to Generic_City or travaling anywhere what my older sister does is she checks us in so that way we dont have to wait in the big line at the airport and we already have our seats picked so that is also a good thing. like i said in the top paragraph in my postion technolgy has been really halpful for pepole. you can really do anything with your phone you can also pay with apple pay if you leave your wallet at home that is something you can do pay with apple pay.

450A7F9AC54A,"It was wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing for our gale or accomplish. I personally agreed with the "" Thomas Jefferson wrote.

"" Determine never to be idle"" It is not good when you are not doing much work. Don't be un idle.

I support my idea with several reasons.

First of all,

I personally agreed with the Thomas Jefferson wrote. If you use your time properly,time is very important in your life you will be productive day use your time. For example I must be weak up in the morning do my exercise every day. I will be healthy It is very important when you have a good healthy. After that you will be managing your time for the hole day by firshing your time. Then I go on time my school. Because to have a good skill is very important. ""knowledge is a power"" I will get my a good education. Also, I go to my job and make my money in the mean time. For this reasons when use your time that will be a good productive day makes you happy. I heat to be seat and watching TV all day and play game.

Second, I am very happy for making some one happier or helping.

Because on my extra time I always go to the library and working as a voluntary helper for some people need help. Also, what ever i have information I shard with people and give a good information then make them happier.

In addition, I always go with the alimentary school when they have school trip.

Helping for the teacher. Especially, working with the kids it is fun and having a good time when i help the kids it make me happy.

Third, you will be a successful and accomplish your life. When you work hard you will be have a good life for the rest of your life. At the same time all your family have a good life. In addition, Life is short you need to be work hard don't be rune slowly it is good to be not idle. The more you work the more get success.

Eventhough, some times have a difficult time never give up you have to be strong and continue do some thing. Also, when you have a bud habite avoid as soon as a possible to be a successful person.

Incounuclsion, It was wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing the right way.

It is not good running slowly or not doing much work.

you should be work hard and discipline for every thing. That's way I agree with the wonderful Idea ' Thomas Jefferson wrote'

45291197F292,"I agree

I think it's a good idea for the students to start a specific career young,because you can be getting early experience to working in a certain field that their future career my require.

Its good to choose a career now instead of later because reaching early adulthood with no planned career in mind, because you may have a certain job that you may not like since you didnt plan ahead for your dream career and you be stuck with a 9-5 job.

With things like finishing high school and not going into college to further your education for that dream job you want will make your chances of getting the job you want scarce or even impossible.

2. What makes It worse Is, not having the diploma required for that certain job which means you could end up in community college again re-taking class for your job you didnt decide to choose while in high school.

3.

And another thing I've seen Is having one career not work out and a person ends up not having a backup plan for their second career. adding to that some of these careers require years of school some specific schools like law school or going to a school for doctors.

I don't agree with choosing a career early in high school,

because most high school students don't know what they want to be or they don't have a career in mind at the moment.

Students should not be required to take a career path so early, when they have yet to experience their first job or paycheck. and not having any interest in the job offers that are shown to them on the application.

Most students are young, and requiring them to have a career plan will end up having them feel like they will be rushed, into doing things like going to career interest fairs choosing what he's interested in and why and talking about with others and what things he or she will need to do.

2. Some high schools care about future jobs they want while most don't so most will not care about their future career and just choose a random career to get started on because they dont know what they like.

3. Some high school students genuinely do not care about school or their own career, so they just drop out mainly because they don't like high school and want to do other ""things"" outside of school adding to that there could be a stress level that is being put on high school kids thinking about the future instead of enjoying the present.

so in conclusion students should have their own decision on weather they want to have a career plan now or later.",2.0,2.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,2.5

for example, students who don't have the enought of money and they need to work.

this show that many students get benefits from this opcion that school give to students, because students can work by the day and take the class by the night.

in another example we have students that for any reason can not attend to school.

they could stay at home and also get the credits they need to graduate from schoool.

this opcion is also good for the students who want to graduate early from school. for example, students that only want to be by 3 years at school, they can take the regular classes and also can take some classes as distance learning. this suggest that every schools should have this program, because it is so helpfuly for students who want to graduate from school, but they can't attend school.

online classes also help people who already finish the school, but they want to continue studing and they can take clases online. for example a teacher who have a basic degree to teach, but he want to get a master degree. he or she can teach by the they, and he can take his classes online, when he get free time.

In this ocation i am disagree with this statment because sometimes people act different like when I firt meet my grilfrind I

was thinking that she was a happy person but with the thime I see that she was not that happy my impresion changes of that situation.

The majority of the people act different when they meet some a person that they going to meet for example, when you going to see a job you need to act happy and smile to they can acept you but in realiti you are sad so with the timethey changes that first impresion.

So alot of people when they meet a person they have a diffferent impresion so the other person can think that she or he is happy or have a good firt impresion or some times you act normal but we the tome you changes and your impresion too.

another reason is when you whent at new school at the first time you act that you are cool and you say things that they like to they can acept you so with the time they going to know that was a diferent impresion.

4665A1D77D6C,"In this passage i will tell you my point of view of this, I believe that it dosen't matter how much experience someone has over the other person, it only increases there chances of getting picked, and only by a small margin. my reason is that people shouldn't pick a person by what or how much experience they have, but pick the people that are best for the job such as being a hard worker, fast learner, or by being determined to work. you might not have the experience but they can still pick you for the job, all you have to do is to prove to them that you can do learn it and will be able to do after it.

I think getting a new job is like learning a new unit in a class all you need is a person to show you how they do it and improve on that and, you will have setbacks or things that you won't understand. but you will still have the teacher or the person that is helping you, that can tell you if your doing something wrong or to answer your questions. once you had enough practice with it, you can help other people that have the same problems as you or the same questions. by getting the job you've learned how to do those things and how to teach other people how to do it too. you don't need experience you need people with experience to teach you so you can teach other people.

In my experience to have a good worker they don't need to have experience, they only need people to teach them while there working seeing what they are doing wrong and improving on that. while i was working in a construction job, i was making mistakes all over the place, i wasn't doing well with tools or machines, sometimes i would cut the materials too small or too large, so most of the time i would hand it over to one of my coworkers and with the tools, most of the time would get them mixed up, for example one coworker will ask for a tool and my mind would just be blank then they would just get it themselves, so after i had to practice with the tools and by the end of the time i was working there i never got one thing wrong, this proves that all you need is practice during the job or work, it dosen't matter if you have never done it before all you need to practice.

Although i do acknowledge the people with experience have more of a chance to get the job there going for but all i'm saying is that you shouldn't doubt yourself when someone has experience and you don't, just keep your eyes open and your head strong and see if you got the job, and if you didn't, try another time, it dosen't matter if you fail to get the job once or multiple times, it dosen't matter if someone has more experience then you, if you prove to them that you can work harder then them, and learn more then them they will pick you for the job. all you need to do is go to the interview and show what you can do and what sort of person you are.

In this passage i have show that you don't need to have the experience to get the job or being a good worker, you just need to be determined to do the work and they will recognize that, and they will respect you more. but only if you do good work you can't expect good things to happen because of bad results, but if you prove to them that you will be able to learn how to do it then you will get the job. i have also shown my own experience with it of being a worker that had no experience to being the one that never messed up at the end.

475AAF4D130E,"Most successful people keep study new carrers or leanirng new tasks to do in order to became even wealthier and to not get bored of doing the same job daily. Ralph Emerson states that, you will never grow if you do not try something new that you already know. Meaning that if people do not expand their knowledge after of what they already know they will never accomplish more to became more successful in life. However, if you are willing to expand you horizons and break out the comfort zone, you will grow and achieve higher goals. Trying something new of what you already mastered help people to grow because it lead people will live real experiences and it provide more opportunities. and it break the comfort zone.

To star with, the more people learn, the more opportunities they have. Opportunities are provide for people that are open to learn new things and grow in what they do. For instance, I have been working in a part-time in a salad place for two years. The first year I learned all the work stations which I was really good at it. After a year, I realized that it was the time to expand my knowledge and also to ask for a raise. I became a valid trainer in all the store's stations. Now I teach new workers and assist them how to do their task in the correct way and they are paying me better. This shows that if I would not be open to learn how to be a trainer at the store, I would not be paying as well as today. Being capable to try something new offer better opportunities in order to grow rather than getting stuck in the same place without trying to achieve higher goals.

Moreover, the desire to try different things make people to live many wonderful experiences. If people never expand their horizons , they will never experiences the adventures life has to offer. For instance, Last summer I went to a campus in a university to get more information about careers that I was interested in. I meet wonderful students from other schools and learned computer science. The teachers provided me the information and requirements to get into the University and the different classes that I have to take in order to get a degree in computer sciences. Also, we practiced several methods to create graphs and draw in the computers. Since, I visited that place I got more convince to study computer science in the future and it is a experience that I will never forget because I realized that I have the skills to study that career as my major. If I would not go , I will never notice that I could study computer science in the out coming. Learning new things lead to live and learn experiences that help people to grow in their future.

As can be seen,

it is better to try something new because people can explore experiences that will never forget and and they will learn new things to became even more successful in their lives. People have the right to never stop learning and get new skills that will prepared them for whatever they want to accomplish and change about their routine. If the whole world have the willing to keep learning despite they are mastered in something already, they will be more professionals and a wealthier society.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5

When you are trying to get advice from someone remember to ask more then one person for advice. One of my reasons is that how ever is trying to get advice should get it form multiple people not just from one person. My other reason is that getting advice form people can have a good or bad point of view but it also can depends on how you take the advice. My last reason is asking people for advice can hurt it's not always going to make you happy.

My first statement is that how ever is trying to get advice should get it form multiple people not just from one person. Most of the people in this world have different point of view for each person on the way they see them or maybe by the way they you act and look. Asking only one people is not a good idea because someone might just be looking at you how you look and how you dress. They might just say bad things to you because they thing your not worth nothing and they are the only one's that actually are worth something in this world. People in this time don't gave good advice to people because all they want to do is make people look bad in front of others.

My second statement is that getting advice form people can have a good or bad point of view but it also can depends on how you take the advice. Will in my point of view asking people for advice is not a great idea because some people might just till you lies when you are asking for advice. Sometimes people just tell you lies because they know that you need help but all they are going to do is make you look bad. They are some people that all they want you is to suffer just because they are having problems at home. Getting advice form one person is not a good idea because you might not know if they hate you or that you might have done something that hurt them and you didn't know and you asked them for advice they would gave you bad advice just for what you did to them.

My last statement is that asking people that you thing that will tell you the truth no matter if it hurts or not is not a bad idea. They are some people that would tell you the truth even if it's going to hurt a lot but the only thing they want for you is too be happy. Asking people older then you is a great idea like your family because maybe they have been though a lot maybe they might even hate you or something else but they would never lie to you because you are there children they care about you. Getting advice is not bad it also can depend on the way you decide to take it if you take it as a good or bad way because most of the people that are always there in your bad a good moment always want the best thing for you because they love you.

In conclusion, asking for advice sometimes and talking to others more advice can help you make good choice but at the same times bad choice it all depend on you if you want to be a great or bad person. Everyone has there point of view to take the advice that someone gives you in a good or bad way. Mostly the people that love you are going to tell you the truth even though if it hurt because they know that later or after you are going to find out the truth.

In this world you should take most of the advice that other people gave you because they have already been thought a lot but they don't want you to through the same thing because they actually want you to be someone if life even if they couldn't be someone in life. The advice that someone gives you is not bad it to help you see how hard they work because they didn't take the advice that they gave you are they didn't get the chance like you have so if someone gives you a great advice you should be grateful.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.0,2.0
495A94390744,"Technology is a super useful and daily component we use in our daily lives,however in my opinion technology is being misused and taken advantage of by society. For example your social life becomes different, it get's addicting, or changes you as a person, it shows that people change overall. Those are some of the many reasons why people take advantage of technology.

Technology can change your social life, for example you stop communicating with friends and your social skills start to grow weak,such as confidence and being specific while talking. Secondly technology can be an addiction or something people depend on a lot. For example spending hours on hours on your phone or a computer could be consider addiction. While taking tests or quizzes you can't depend on technology to help you and that shows that you depend on the internet. At last technology changes you as a person. Another words whatever you see on the internet it becomes real to you which means, now you're living in a fantasy instead of reality. It also makes you think differently instead of using your brain and you also depend on the internet way much more.

Technology can be useful and can save our life sometimes. One out of the two reason why technology is useful is the time your saving. For example if you have to get work sent to your boss, the internet comes in handy, or if you have a project due at school you can also use the internet to turn it in on time. Technology will forever be useful for educational purposes. For example if you need any type of information you can find it on the internet. There's a lot of things you could learn on the internet also. Technology can be a very inconsistent feature for people, therefore it can benefit people and change someone's life in a negative way. Use technology wisely because it brings a lot of negatives with it.

There's many ways to solve the problems that come with the usage of technology. Your limitations to the usage of technology could be lowered so the addiction doesn't get out of hand. The things you use technology for should be only things that benefit you, therefore it doesn't become your social life. Always try to be yourself and don't let things on the internet change you because technology is will forever be here and will always change, therefore you don't want to adapt to it for the rest of your life.

If the students might relaxing then I think they will learning better and faster.

Some parent want my son or daughter go to the bedroom early. Because parent can control them easy, example like some students will say I still do home work on the Laptop, but they playing game with friends. The best way is for students go to sleep early. If your might for students sleep early, It really good for eyes and healthy because one young people can sleeping enough eight our every night, you can feel comfortable for star learning better new day. And if you don't sleeping enough, you can't learning anything at school because you always sleeping in classes and teachers always say ''wake up, wake up''. It not good for you and teachers. And when you go home, time for sleep but you don't feel sleep because you sleeping in classes too much. That's why you don't feel want to sleep, and today to tomorrow to whole life, you still don't want to sleep early. Maybe that will be become the cycle in your bad life, If you don't wanna change your style.

I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home is not good. Because when parents coming home, they need talking, do something or have a dinner with family. It's will be better you do a lot homework. If you have dinner every night, you will have a lot of conversation with your wife or daughter, Since you will be know what your family want and your sentiment with family will be better and better.

When students learning online or video at home, maybe they don't understand what video say and if they have a question, what teachers they will ask ? And if everybody have a question to asked teachers, the teachers can't responded the question too much for students. If students waiting for tomorrow go to school, maybe students will be forgot the question they want ask right now.

I think students need learning at school better learning at home. Because one people one idea, that's mean have a lot of answers your guess and you will be know the best the answers from teacher. It'll be helping you how to do work team. Work team so important with students because in your future, labor need you know how to work together. If you know how to work, you will be become the manager or boss. If I work with teachers, maybe I will better for my way.",3.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5

If you are afraid of highs you can go and Skydive with your friends or one of your family members. When your are up in the sky you get to see trees,grass and other stuff from far away. I think it would be fun because you get to fly in the sky. If you Skydive you can see animals that you never saw in your entire life. You can also maybe see weird stuff that you never saw. You can see a dog,cat or small houses and tiny people. If you Skydive i think you would fine a lot of different kind of things in the air. If you were to scared to go on a roller coaster. You can go on a roller coaster now because you jumped off an airplane. And If you were to scared to go airplane because it was to high. Now you can go on a airplane and travel because you wouldn't be scared to be that high and where you jumped from the airplane. The airplane is going to be the same hight. I think you won't have fears of heights anymore and you would like to travel a lot. You can go to places that you can't go with a car. Like bora bora or the other tropical places. Skydiving can be a lot of fun but it can also be very dangerous. If you don't know any thing like how to turn on the air bag for you to float you could fall when you land. If you don't know how to land you could hurt yourself or land somewhere else. If you don't feel safe i think you should go to the indoor one first. After all, Skydiving can make you see weird stuff that you never seen before and you can face your fears by going on an airplane or riding on a roller coaster. I think one day you should go skydiving and see every thing that you can see. If you are scared of highs like mountains or going on high stuff. I think it is going to help you but if you think you are not going to know what to do for the air bag. I think you should go to the indoor one first. If you want to go to the outside one someone is going to be on top of you and they are going to be doing the air bag and the landing. You are just going to be flying with them and you don't have to worry about anything you can just see the view and see if you see anything interesting that you never seen before.",2.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0
49F54A35F6F3,"Some people say that students are better off attending classes online, mostly because they can feel a sense of comfort and no worries of school tardiness. I say that it's better to not attend distant classes and attend them from the school itself.

Students are better off attending classes from the actual school because students tend to have more concentration while actually attending the class. When attending the class from home, students will be more concentrated on their home atmosphere, or what happens at home. Concentrating onto something usually comes from the atmosphere you are in. Attend your classes are better and more effective when the person is alerted or more attentive to their classes or courses.

Moreover, students will develop social communication when interacting with other students. Social communication is important because not only will you get to know the other person's side of knowledge, but you can get experience from the other person that could benefit or impact your way of making desicions in your life. Students will be more of an introvert if attend classes from home or distant classes. In this way, students will definitely develop working skills when they start having a job as an older person.

However, even if they won't be able to go through or worry about tardiness if taking distant classes, going to school knowing that there is tardiness, will prepare them for the future when running to work and making it on time. Making to school or work on time depends on how the individual is smart enough to manage their own time wisely.

In conclusion, the more preferable method for students is coming to school or the class session wherever it's taking place. In this way, students develop better communication, better concentration and develop time management. Students will become better individuals. ",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0
4B0CF2CFCB4A,"Should people follow their own instincts, or should they follow other people step?

If people seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters they would not fail in life; however, people should make their own decisions. People should make their own decisions because they can define their self, follow their instincts, and get experience through the life.

First, people should make their own decision because they can define their self. Every single person should make a difference on the world. For example, I do not like to be guide for others person, I like to be different than every one else, try new things, and have my own ideas. Also, around the world are many people that are known for define their personality and for try to change the world with their ideas. Barack Obama is one of them, he was known for his humanity and his charismatic. Every person was made it to perform extraordinary different decisions. People should make their own decisions because they can define their self.

Next, people should make their own decisions because they can follow their instincts. Many times ours instinct are right, but sometimes we let others person tell as what to do, therefore we fail. For example, when we are taking a test and we make cheating,

we fail the test because we not even like to try and follow our instincts. When I have to take a test and I do not know much about the test, I just follow my instincts and at the end, I got good result because is not necessary to do what others persons do. Is more about what you believe that is the best. There is not major accomplishment than do your best, to believe on your-self. People should make their own decisions because they can follow their instincts.

Finally, people should make their own decisions because they can get experience through the life. When a person make their owns decision do not matters if they are successful, or if they fail. Because at the end they learned how it was it and how to do next time. But if they never try, they never would know how hard, or easily is achieve something. For example, last year I fail all my SOL because an friend told me that he pass it all his SOL and was easily.

He suppose to be a expert, so I truth he. But was not tru and I learned that is better try by my self. now I capable to give advice to anthers students and help them. If I never had make my own decisions, I would never get experience. People should make their own decisions because they can get experience through the life.

In conclusion, people should make their own decisions because they can define their self, follow their instincts, and get experience. Every person should make the difference on the World and express their own ideas. When people follow their instincts we accomplish good result. Also, when people got experience through the life following their instinct they could be successful and are capable to advice other people.

4C17DB6FF2DC,"John Lubbock quotes on choosing your own character or letting influences form your is a passage I can live by.

For the reason of it being actually true because, sometimes things you see throughout your life would change your character. The people you look up to can can your character because you want to be just like them. but sometimes its not always a good change sometimes you can have a bad influence.

Things you see in life can change your character. Lets say you are in the streets and you get into a car accident then you are gonna have a chance to be afraid to drive a car. It can also be changed by a bad experience, lets say you are in an abusive relationship after that relationship ends you would think every girl/guy is an abusive person.

What if you are living in foster care and you never get adopted you will think that you will never among to nothing and be nothing your whole life.

The people you look up to can have a dramatic change in your character. Let's say your father is your biggest inspiration you will want to be just like him when your older and follow in his foot steps. But, if your inspiration isn't anyone in your family but it is a famous sport player you will grind your butt off just to be in the same team with them and hopefully play along side with that player. Newer influences these days are trough social media and movies and in my opinion those are the worst ones because they usually trying to sell you something or market something to their audience.

Sometimes its not always a good change sometimes you can have a bad influence. Having a bad influence can lead to a lot of trouble and you can even end up in jail for it. Let's say you look up to your father and he is a very toxic person and a violent person and you end up like him that's not a good thing. Also something that can happen is that you look up to a very bad very disturbing person and he likes to hurt people and then you start hurting people because you want to be just like him.

Those who believed not being able to attend classes fom home wouldn't benefit students because they can't work with other students. Around 200 articles said that students that attend online classes don't have the best projects just because they can't have other student's opinion. For example, so many different ideas by having a group can be more interesting than only having a person's ideas.

However, students would benefit attending classes from home because they can feel comfortable. Furthermore, a school survey showed that students prefer online clases because that makes them feel comfortable just to be seated inappropriate. I agree with these people because I like to be seated in many ways, but in school rules is only a way to be seated.

Also, students would benefit attending classes from home because they can be more safe. Lately, more than hundred school shootings had happened, so it show us being at school can be dangerous. Other big danger can be gangs at school they can be an influence with so many bad things on a child's life.

In my opinion being able to attend classes at home can make parents happy; they don't have to be worried for their child's safety.

First of all,

you will never know everything but the most important things is trying because if you dont try, you will never learn, but sometime its okay to be failure without a enthusiasm that means that you dont care, you are not interesting in anything or another way to see that dont have a enthusiasm is when you waste time for example if i feel like i am just losing every time and i dont even has a enthusiasm, something to be focus, I will enjoy my time to try to better, to be a winner I always will be try to increase.

Secondly, some time people love to be a better person but there will be people who doesnt enjoy the time to increase, I just know one thing for sure sometime people like to stay in the same step because if you want to be a winner, you must try and see what you can do to go up, I will try to have a good future, a better future for my family, to have my own things, living failure make you a weak person everyone can see that you are weak, that you are not smart enough , that you are comfortable for what you have, but you must be a ambition person to have more than what you have.

4E13812BC1ED,"Meet new people and make new friends is fun. Having social relationships; is a good way to have a good community. Always, when we see new people that we are about to meet, we have first impressions- ideas, feelings or opinions about a person based on the superficial. For some people, first impressions are almost impossible to change. However, I disagree with this statement, because this can change by: introducing each other, know more about favorite things, and ask questions about their life, then our first impressions will change.

When a person is about to meet another person, they act differently as they are in their daily life, which is totally fine, because they are going to introduce each other and it will change. One day, when I was in my freshman year, I was really nervous and exciting at the same time, and this because I did not know anyone at the school, but I meet one girl; she was really kind and friendly. So, we introduce each other, and my first impression before introduce each other was, that she was serious and shy. The importance of this, is that our first impression can change after introducing each other, because we can have an idea of how the person is, based on their look or way to act, but this idea can be totally different after cross a few words each other.

Furthermore, a good way to change our impression is knowing more about the other person, know about their favorite things such as hobbies, sports, and others; putting this in practice it can change the way of thinking of both persons. In my way of thinking about the impressions, these can be bad or good impressions, and a personality is part of the impression because it shows the behavior of a people. So, it is important to know more about the person; about their personality and by this could have a clue about the personality of the person.

Finally, different person has a something important in their life, and that is what makes special to a person. For example, all my friends before they know me, they think that I look shy, calm and serious before they know me, but time later these impressions change for them. They told me now ""when we saw you for the first time, we though that you was so quite and serious"". And they said this, because they know more about me and about my life now, and they think that I am a fun friend and happy, so this is what makes me special, that I always look serious, but when the people know me, they think that I am friendly and happy. And I think that always, when we see a person that we never seem before, we should think to ask about their life, because details about their life can help us to change our way of view and think about the person.

Therefore, first impressions can change, they are not always accurate in the way of how the behavior of the people can be. We could think that people are as the way of their physical appearance, but that is completely wrong. In order to meet new people, we have to introduce each other, know more about them, and ask questions about their life, then we can have a clearly personality about the person. After this, our impressions would change to a positive or negative impressions. We should not trust in our first impressions about a person, we should meet the person and our first impressions will change. ",4.0,2.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5

Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". Although some say being inactive serves a purpose, nevertheless, if people are doing something productive they will accomplish more because they will become active and gives self confidence.

To begin, many people are inactive which does not serve them a purpose. For example, everyone is doing something on their agenda weather it's working, school, or shopping. People are accomplishing daily tasks everyday. This shows that, when people are doing something it serves them a purpose to be active which helps accomplish goals. Clearly, if people do not commit to becoming active they will not accomplish many goals.

Furthermore, this gives people confidence and assurance that goals or tasks will be fulfilled. For instance, when being active while accomplishing goals people start to have confidence and assurance that being active can help with accomplishments. This proves that, people are best when active because they become confidant with themselves.

Overall, while not being active and doing something productive people will not see the potential they have. In conclusion, when humans are doing something, they accomplish goals which help them develop confidence and can measure how much they are active.          ",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0

4F35BA561593,"Some people ask if it is better to work with a group or alone? Everyone has different opinions about the benefits of working in a group or working alone, some people prefer working alone and others prefer working in groups. I believe that the best way for the people to improve is by working in groups because they learn more and understand better.

First, working in groups help the people to improve in school or at work because they learn new things. For example, listening other ideas and points of view from their partners. One day my English teacher make groups of four in class and gave each group a piece of paper, then he put some questions in his board and told us that we need it to answer them as a group, when we finish the teacher told us that we were going to discuss it, then when each group discuss their answers with the class we all realized that each group had different opinions, ideas, and points of view. Each group learn something new from each other.

""Everyday we all learn new things in life"".

Second, working in groups help the people improve because they will understand better. For example, asking their partners if they have a question or didn't understand really well. My history teacher gave the class an assignment that we need it to completed by the end of the class, when the teacher gave the instructions i didn't understand her really well, then i ask one of my partners if he could explained to me again in order for me to understand it, be able to give my opinions and help my group.

""We could do more if we all help each others"".

Many people believe that is better to work alone because they will concentrate more. For example, they will not get distracted with anyone and will finish the work faster. A friend of mine has always work alone because she said that when the people is working in groups they tend to start talking, distract others, don't do their work and by the end of the hour only got a couple of questions done. However, this argument is meaningless because if they don't understand really well, then they would not have a partner who could explained to them what they are doing. For example, not finish their work because they got stuck in a part. Not having someone to discuss the work with could be hard sometimes.

In conclusion, there's a lot of benefits when working with a group. Some of the others benefits that working in groups has are; making new friends, having the opportunity to learn more about your partner, and learn more about yourself. Having to work with someone is a good idea because you don't have a lot of pressure about having to finish the work on time or not having idea what to do. Even though some people say the opposite, i believe that working in groups is better than working alone.

When they go outside to ride a bike their legs make movement.

And when they bend their stomachs to move their legs a little, their stomach also make's some movement.

And all that body movement helps them get into shape, the best way to get in shape when they ride a bike is when it's really hot outside.

So don't get one unless you ready to take on the risks for it."" Another person could say, ""It's really easy to own a dog. All you have to do is feed it, wash it, play with it, take it out on a walk, and clean it's mess."" After he or she listens to both people, he or she makes a pros and cons list and decides which side has more and which one is the best.

Another example, someone wants to play a sport, but it can be too dangerous. One person says, ""Don't do it. It's not worth risking your life and slowly dying in the hospital."" Another person says, ""Do it! It's not only fun, but it can also help you be more cooperative and you are being active."" Again, someone can agree with both answers, so that's why people need to compromise, to both get what they want.

One example of a compromise, you want to watch the new movie

Billy Madison.

However, you are underage. It can work out if you ask someone if he or she has ever seen the movie. If yes, ask he or she if there's any scene okay for your age. If yes, you will probably be able to only watch the movie once. Otherwise, you are goind to have to wait until you're at the age.

Another example is, you want to stay up. However, your parents never let you. You can talk to them and see if they can let you stay up for at leat just one night. If you're lucky, you will probably be able to stay up during the weekend. But never on a school night.

That's why I think seeking advice from multiple people is a better choice. Not only it will help you more, but, it can also teach you how to deal with real-life situations. Also compromising and making a list will help you with that. It will as well teach people how to listen better and be more supportive of others. Then you decide whether if it's right or wrong.

It does , a lot of people in their life have failed to do something in life for example: failed a test ,failed to do a work assignment ,failed to show up to work once or twice, ect. You can fail a test , fail to show up to work but you get an opportunity to fix that mistake but some people just dont care about that opportunity.

Say you were to get a 75% on a math test but you wanted to get a better score you did study, but didn't show up to class , or stay after school to get extra help. So then you ask the teacher if you can re-take the test and the teacher say that you can but you have to show up to class ,and stay after if needed extra help ; because without studying, or showing up to class ,ect. How will you pass the math test or any test if you dont study . It's okay to fail and fail no one is perfect not everyone is going to get it right the first time unless you just have goodluck but still you have to study for a test no matter what.

Let's say you had a band concert tonight , you had a positive mind set because you have been practicing since February you were nervous not because you have a concert but also because you have a solo part but you know you got this because you've been practicing ,studying the notes and staying after with the band. It was time for the show; you guy's finished and did a wounderful job playing the music and did an amzaing job for you'r solo part. Not only did you practice and stay after you kept a positive mind set for yourself.

You just can't give up on yourself because you failed you have to push and push yourself even if you don't have enought positive in you if you want to become a nurse ,actor , jet flyer it doesn't matter what you want to be you have to push yourself and have a positive mind set.

Without a positive mind set your probably not going to end up were you wanted to be in the first place. So if you fail the first or second time just know not to give up just yet and to think positive.",3.0,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0
50419253BA19,"Should take classes like music,a drama,or an art class be required? Although some say that arts class should not be required,actually it should because students can develop talents and also it can help students to lost some stress. In addition, students will find a fun way to be less stress. I am agree with the assertion that student should be required to take an arts class.

Those who believe that arts class shouldn't be required they have their reasons. For example they believe that students may not like the class assigned and they also think that it can cause that a student may start cutting his classes.

From my perspective I believe that arts class should be required to students because they can develop talents. I believe that because when I was in my country there was one private high school that was located at my city,in that high school all students were required to take an arts class and nevertheless some of them knew how to pain,act,and sing and they were so talented in any arts class that they were taking. Also in my country every year there is a competition that call the most talented students from the country, this competition only awards students that are very talented in arts class such as pain,act,and sing an the students that just to go to the high school that was in my city they frequently just to take first place in those competitions and that's why I believe that that arts class should be required for students it will help develop talents.

From my point of view, I think that arts class should be required because it can help students to lose some stress. I believe it because like a student that I am every time when I get off from my Algebra 2 class I am always super stress,but after that class I have the art class. In that class I always lost all my stress when I start drawing things even though I do not how to draw but it help me a lot to keep my main clam. Also why I believe that arts class help students to be less stress is because the environment in the class is always nice,and the students are always focus in the things that they are doing without making to much noise and that is why I believe that arts class should be required to help them to don't be stress the all day in school .

To summarize students should be required to take arts class because they can learn to do other things that other people can't do and also it can help them like a way to feel better after coming from other class that was awful.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5
5077C09B20DC,"It's a wonderful day to spend outdoors and do something productive. Spending more time outdoors is better than being at home or being on your phone all day. Families can do different types of activities outdoors. Going to the state fair is something all families or friends can do that is fun. Another way of enjoying outdoors is going camping with your family.

Spending more time with your family outdoors can be fun and productive. People can go hiking with other people. Hiking is an outdoor activity that you can walk. When your like stress you can walk and listen to the beautiful birds chirping.

Like for an example, fishing, hiking, going to the beach, doing cookouts, and going to the park is an activity. Everybody would be occupied, and would have so much excitement in what they are doing. For an example, last summer I went to Pocohuntus State Park with my family. We went on a tour around the whole park. As we were walking, we had seen a building. We had entered the building, and inside it was a mini zoo. The mini zoo was filled with all different types of animal. There was animals that wasn't from Virginia, and brought it from another state. I would love to go back with my family this summer again.

Going to the state fair has a lot of options for you to do. Like for an example it has games, and roller coasters and more variety of games to play. The state fair is a really fun place. For instance, I went to the state fair last year with my cousin. The state fair was full of people and enjoyment. Their was a lot of games, roller coasters, a mini farm, there was a concert, a lot of food courts, and horse racing. That day was a really productive day because we had to walk from station to station. I rode a roller coaster called the ""Dome"" it was really scary and it kept spinning upside down, sideways from left to right. This is a good outdoor activity to do with families or friends.

Another way to enjoy outdoors is to go camping with your family. You can play games, do campfire, and make moores while you are in the outdoors. For example, when I was 8 years old I went camping with my family. I remember that day it was so cold. I slept in the back in the trunk with my cousins, and then I transferred to the passenger seat because it was so cold. The next morning everybody woke up and then after we took a walk around the lakes. Afterwards everybody packed their stuff and headed back home.

All of these are examples of doing outdoors activity with your family . Spending time outdoors with your family like hiking, going to the state fair, and going camping is fun and everybody will enjoy their day. Everybody should at least do one of these activities outdoors, so you can feel relief from everything you have in mind. Having fun at these places would want you to go back again                  ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0

People will also need other peoples choices because they are not sure if they are correct or wrong. Seeking for more advice will help you know other peoples opinions and how they feel and it will also depend on the question they are being asked.

526E417A97BD,"Many people tell me I have talent in soccer. For most of my years I trained to get better and better so I can become the best on my team. There were some faster players on my team and there still are. If you have ball control and skills you will be able to dribble past faster and stronger opponents. Also you will be able to hold the ball in your possession until someone opens up for a clear pass. Some skills I have are ball control, speed, agility, stamina, and dribbling.

I developed ball control by practicing and watching professional soccer players play. My dad knows drills to gain ball control he taught me how to do them. Then I started doing those drills 3 times a week. I knew I was making progress because I was keeping more possession of the ball during my games and practice. I was able to keep possession of the ball until my teammates got open for a good position to receive the ball.

Speed, agility, and stamina are some of the basic skills you need for this sport. For speed I did a lot of running, I would run at least 3 laps around the field for warm up with my brothers and dad. I also did many exercises for my leg muscles not too much weights because that would make my legs stiff. For agility I did some similar drills to the speed ones but faster movement and there are many different drills I also had to do with quicker pace. For stamina it was just a lot of running to get better at not getting tired too early and to be able to play for full 90 minutes of your game with enough energy.

I enjoy doing drills for dribbling because it's fun. My strongest skill in soccer is probably dribbling. I used to do a lot of drills for dribbling when I was new to the sport and I did more drills and got better and better each time. I would mostly play left mid because I was able to keep possession of the ball longer. Also when there's no one open to receive the ball or in a good position to receive the ball I would have to dribble through many players and I would go to the left corner so most of the defenders would come and try to get the ball leaving the striker open and making it easier for him to score and sometimes I dribble to the goal and try to score.

Students would know what to do after high school. The student wouldn't worry about what job their going to get or what collage they want to go to. They would have everything figured out and it would put less stress on them. For example, If you already know what you want to do it would be easier to apply for collage and you could get a part time job in the career that you chose.

Students would know a lot about the career they want to do. In high school they could research things about their career like how much they pay,the conditions they work in, and if it takes a lot of work. They could also talk to people that are in that career and take academy classes. It would make it easier for the student because they would be well educated about the career. For example, when they apply for collage or a job they could say that they've been studying and have a better understanding of that specific career. It would give them a better chance in getting accepted or getting the job.

It would be easier for the student to get a job in the career. The student would have a better chance of getting a job in the career they want to do if they have been learning and taking classes in high school.

5384378F1AC2,"The great question here is, should schools allow students to use cell phones for educational purposes or should cell phones be prohibited in the classroom? In my opinion, schools should use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Some school staff members may claim that cell phones should be forbidden in the classroom even for eductional purposes. Because, they think students will lose their attentions. However, I firmly believe that shools should allow students to use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes.

Students will be effective academically as long as they use cell phones in the classroom. There are several reasons for my opinion. My first reason is that as a student, whenever I use cell phones in the classroom, I can search things easily and take pictures when nedded if my teachers allow me; which will help me on my studying when I go home. Another reason for my opinion is, if I don't have my phone with me, I will be eager until the bell rings and get my phone back without concentrating on the class. For example, I have a friend whose father took her cell phone forcing here to study the whole school year. Stubbornly, she stops doing what he tells her to do. Instead, she persistently hang-out and have more fun. As a result, she got F's for all of her classes. Therefore, using cell phones in the classroom helps the learning-teaching process.

Using cell phones in the classroom helps to call if something happens in the class. For instance, if a stranger comes with a gun or if a lock-down happens and I hear the stranger's voice, I will call 911 for help. Secondly, if an emergency occurs like fire, hurricane, and a huge lightneing while I am in the class, I may need to call to my family to let them know how I am doing. In that case, they will know about my situation. To sum up, most people like doing things which are forbidden for them. Students may hide and use their phones for another purpose eventhough they are not allowed to use it in the classroom; which is more riskier than using in front of the teachers. Consequently, the positive effect of using cell phones in the classroom is more influential.

In conclusion, schools should use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Other people say that cell phones should not be used in schools during class periods. I obstinately argue that phones should be used in the classroom for the purpose of education since the positive effect is more influential and using cell phones is more quicker than using laptops or other electronic devices.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

56053054CB1F,"I believe that your character will be what you yourself choose to make it, The disicions you make can play a big role in how you turn out to be. For example the people you hang with, How you grew up and the type of household you were in, And my last example is is your motivation because being motivated can help you build good character traits for the future.

The type of people you hang with play a big role in your character because you can pick up a lot of good and bad things from different people. They can influence you to do a lot and you know what they say ""you are who you hang with"" for example if you hang with people who do nothing but good you are going to want to do nothing but good but if you hang around people who are lazy and sit at home doing nothing with there day you are also going to become lazy and not motivated to do anything.

The way you grew up and the type of household you were in also plays a big factor in your character because thats what you are around, That's the energy with you all the time for example if your paerents are having problems at home all the time and you can become depressed and feel down all the time, Since thats the energy thats in the house, Which can make you start struggling in school since you would be down all the time. But on the other side if your household is very good, everyones happy and the vibe is good it can make you a very happy and positive person since thats all the energy you're getting, nothing but positive vibes and it can help you with school.

Your motivation in my opinion is the most important part of building good character traits because it's so good to be motivated and having a something to work for, If you have that the past does not matter and you can be the most awsome person that you can possibly be for example if you are really motivated you can become anything you want. Your past and all the things you overcame can motivate you another example is if you and your family is really struggling that is going to want you to push harder, And in that procces it would build a lot of good character traits that will be with you forever.

In conclusion you make your character and choose the people you hang out with, The type of hpuse you are living in and the things that lead up to you being motivated and i dont think you can get influenced beyond your control because you can control everything you do for example if you don't like your friends switch things up, If you dont like how things are going at home go live with someone else. Everyone should always know that nobody can or should control you, Everyone makes choices bad or good you are the one who made that choice.               ",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,2.5

I agree with this statement, because the time passes in your life is going with it, the more you do the more you get and that is what people don't get, if you want to make accomplishments in your life you have to worked out man, For example Lebron James how do you think he went where he is now, Making steps in his life, goals, family help, you have all of it it is right there you just have to get it.

I can be a example for this, I used to hate school a lot, i went tot his time that i didn't wanna even go there, but there was this English 10 teacher that just speaking with me one day just one day, yes I was having F at that moment, after all that thinking a lot about what she said I passed her class at the end with a B, not knowing that I was going to be able to do it, but I did it just doing what i have to do, like I said people can just tell you where is the door you have to go get it.

The success of life to fall down is important , because with enthusiasm you can do everything, that you would like for your future, still if you fall down. Life in this world is hard to get up, but be strong person with enthusiasm, your life can be easy and not complicated. To fall down in life, you can have many negatives things in life. Life can be more hard as you think it is. Enthusiasm have many positive opportunities in life. This positive opportunities can make your life more easily, because growing with enthusiasm, your future can have more patient,less stress, and more happiness in your life. To failure without lossing enthusiasm can have the sucess of your future. Bringing success into your life, you can learn lessons, that would help you to find opportunities, for you to walk forward. In this statement I agree with mr, Winston Churchill, because this is a every important role statement, that can help people to bring the positive way for making easy life for people in this world.

To fall down in life, you can have many negatives things in life. Life can be more hard as you think. To have better opportunitites, you have to bring that energy to be strong person without giving up. If you want to have dreams, with no enthusiasm it would be hard you to get it. An example"" i want to have the goal, to have this big dream, going to collage."" If you want this dream with negatives thoughts, things without studying, and be lazy to have a job, to safe money for your collage, you can't do anything. Another example "" i want to have a car, a house, a dog, and having a trip everywhere in the world."" You can have a job, but if you are lazy to work, you can get fired, not getting that much money , that you need for all your things you want to have. To have negatives thoughts, you can't have all your things, that you would like to have for a better future into to your life.

To have enthusiasm can bring more easy and posititve thoughts, to accomplish your goals. Because with enthusiasm you can have less stress, you can have more energy, and be patient with everything. To have less stress, with positive thoughts you can make easily things, still If you think that it is hard for you. An example "" i want to pass my sol's in school."" If you want to pass the hardest test in school, to graduated you can study, paying attention to your teacher, do your homework that day is due and having your things on time. You can pass your classes and your sol's, without thinking that much stress in your mind. Another example "" i fell my exam of math class."" You can fell your exam, but you can't give up, because you can have another solution. Teachers give sometimes, opportunities to their students staying after school or come more prepare next time larning a little bit more, because it can be more easily to pass it.

To failure without lossing enthusiasm you can have the success of your future. To have the success into your possitive way, you can have less stress and you can learn the lessons finding better opportunities to move forward. An example "" I did not graduated, because i did not pass one class, it was a requirement for graduation."" It is ok If you did not pass it, but you can have a choice by finding opportunitites in others places. You can repeat school one more year, you can go to other schools that prepare you to pass your exams, and classes, you can go and find information about that class or subject. Another example "" I got fired in my favorite job, because i accidently broke a delicated plate."" You can be sad, but always go and find opportunitties in others places, that can hired you, because if you have experience ready, so it would not be hard for you where to hired you. Becareful what you do, only have the positive way and have the energy, that customers can be surprise about you, how hard you work in your job that you really like.

To fall down can bring you negatives things. Negatives thoughts can bring you in a bad ways, because you want to have that goal that you want to reach, but you can't. This can be a big situation, if you want to reach that goal, but you have to try your best on doing the oppositive way. To have a enthusiasm you can work really hard and make it more easily. Working hard be happy can bring you that attituded, that we all want to see. In this world is hard to bring people in a positive way, because life is hard , but they are people that they want to show that, you can't give up always move forward. To failure without lossing enthusiasm, you can have the success in to your future. This is a lesson that everyone have to follow and not make it hard. If you are negative, just find a way to make you think a lot, because that stress you out and have a negative thoughts, never give up just move forward.             ",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0
573E39E45177,"Is distance learning such as, online learning or video conferencing more benefical than traditional learning?. In my opinion, I believe that most students that take online classes have a higher risk of failing. Therefore, they have a higher change of getting distracted. Studies confirmed that young adults are more likely to get distracted than adults since, their minds are not fully develop. I also believe that, every human being has a different way of learning and goes on their own pace.

There is positive's and negaitive's reasons about person-to-person learning and online learning. Person-to-Person learning helps the students gain more knowledge and interaction. While being in a traditional classes, you can ask questions anytime and gain a relationship with one another. The negaitives of tradtional learning is that, students attend to skip class, not listen to the teacher, and sleep during teaching. Students attend to do these negative actions because they might be force to go to school or they can not go on their own pace.

Online classes are not benefical but you can go on your own pace. Another reason is that, techonolgy is popular in this generation that students rather be in a device. Online classes have a positive side to them because there is many options online in what you want to learn about, but keep in mind that visual is harder than interacting. Visual is diffcult to understand because there is no instuctor or a teacher helping you in person. I believe that everybody is different and we all learn in different ways and different pace.

Some Students would not be able to attend at home classes because of personal problems such as, not having food to feed themselves, some do not have a roof over their heads, or they do not have access to a device. For an example, there are some students at Generic_School that do not have food at their home and all they eat is school lunch. It hurts to see Children that are not able to afford things in life that are in need such as, education. Education is in all of our life's and I hope traditional schools can still be popular as online schools. In this generation techonology is taking over students!.

In conclusion, I support my reasons and my opinions about, traditional learning is a better way to learn than online learning. They both have Pros and Cons but Traditional learning has been in our lives for so many years and techonology and devices are taking over students. Distraction is what young adults have trouble with, Online classes is not a great idea to pursued. There are many reasons and studies, why students should keep attending traditional schools. I also believe everyone works and learns in their own pace and that is why Person-to-person is way to pursued.                        ",3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.0
589CEB00ED37,"Why is having a good behavior when trying to influence or per swaying others? Lets see humans have a brain with that they have emotions, habits, and other cool stuff in the brain. You see people have to talk with one and each other if they don't they will slowing go insane. Some people may say ""why bring up the brain"" you see the brain is what controls your thoughts or emotions of someone or something.

Lets see If someone was feeling down after a person's family pass way, you will try to influence him to move on, but to do that you have to talk to him with a calming voice so can he will feel more relaxed and calm. Why did his mood change? because the person that helped the other person knew by speaking calmly to his friend that he would always have him by his side. If you talk to him with a mean tone, he will get aggressive with you, he would start attacking for not caring about his lose. Because you chose a behavior that didn't fit with the situation, you just made him more mad and now he wouldn't trust you with anything.

When at war and you feel like the enemy side is going to run over you, the commander of the army will say a speech to light up the mood of his soldiers by telling them ""this wouldn't be the end but a new beginning of the war, if we die, we die for our country and for our families."" The commander influence the soldiers that the war is not over yet it's just the beginning and if they die, they die for a reason to protect the innocents back home. why did the commander bring up their families? As a person would you want to see your wife, sons, or daughters suffer from people whos wants to hurt them. It gives the soldiers a boost and a reason to fight to protect the people they love. The commander influence them to fight to protect their love ones.

World War 2, Germany has lost everything money, land, and people. So a dictator name Adolf told to himself that the Americans and the Jews were the problem. Adolf when to a social club and told the people in that club that he was mad at the Americans for taking everything from them and that they should fight to get their land back. The people in the club agreed with Adolf that they should fight. So you see now how Adolf influence the people in Germany by his anger at America. He had a group of German people to fight against his side and over through the president of Germany.

The best way to influence someone is by that person's behaviors towards them. If you have some disagreements a law, you will try to influence people to agree with you that this law doesn't seem fair. Influence people at your job for better working conditions or more time in your breaks, and what would be your behavior angry because you feel like you are not being treated fairly like the higher ups. The person's behavior will define the influence you make on them, it could good or bad it just depends on what behavior you choose.

Every single person in this world has an opinion and view points on this world and when they feel like something is fair or not fair, they would share their opinions with other people and they would choose their tone to per sway other to follow them. To influence others you have to have the same behavior as the people you are trying to influence or it wouldn't work as well if you have the same behavior.

58A9AE90D009,"What I think about extending two more hours in school would be a bad idea because school can be very stressful and give you so much work that can cause people headaches and won't even have time to do their homework at home and they would get really tired and sleepy that looks like their brain will explode with so much work they do and they would have health problems too a person would not resist too much of their body either.

My opinion about it is that they should keep the five-day school week instead of four because I think it's really unnecessary to add more hours to school and take one more day of off. I think if that happens they will take the time from other students time with what they are doing outside of school and activities. The idea would be very pointless and useless. I think five days of school is better than four because five days they have seven hours of school and it's shorter. For me I would get really stressed with more hours of school be more hours means more work to do and I would get really tired of doing so much work and I would get really exhausted. People would have many things in their head and worry too much about it that would cause so many stress and a headache and it would not be good for them.

I think there is some other way to conserve energy and resources than adding hours to school and work. For example they should take care of the earth by recycling and cleaning the water and save up energy. I think it is the best idea to conserve energy and resources because it really important to take care of the earth and learn how to take care of the earth. Many people these days are careless and would prefer to do it in another way like adding more hours to school which is not helpful and that won't do nothing of helping energy and resources, so we have to do another way to conserve it. What I think people should use their brains and do what's best for the whole world and every around us and be helpful. Like for example restore energy would be a good idea or volunteer would be another thing to help the planet, there are so many ways you can do it and how you can do it so it would be really helpful if Everyone would join doing it.

Many people would be disappointed for adding hours because they are subtracting their time and very important things they have to do. A lot of people that over work themselves means their they would get really tired and lazy and the community would be very disappointing and out of control. Another problem would be that if they overwork and get tired and them while driving and could get into to a car accident and that's another why their are so many accidents happening lately and that is really bad so it is a bad idea.

Know one would agree to work more hours and that would cause them to have health problems and their body does not take to much exhaustion in them and that is really dangerous and would risk their life's for it, i would not over work myself if I were them that is too much to Handel and would get me sick too that my body would not take it either so no it would be a really bad idea.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5
58EBDB3621E5,"Students would benefit, from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. There are a lot of kids with disabilities who wants to go to school but they are afraid of being bullied by other students in school.

There are some parents who are in college, and have many responsibilities and still needs education. There are some other kids that needs to go to school but can't get out of their houses because of their sickness or health conditions.

The first reason why students would benefit from attending classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, is because of those kids with disabilities who wants to go to school ,but are afraid of being bullied because of their physical appearance. I remember when i was young , i used to get bullied in school because of my bow legs. Kids could laugh at me , and that used to hurt my feelings at the point of not willing to go to school.

This same thing is still happening today to a lot of kids in different schools , that they don't want to go to school because of being bullied and judge for their physical appearance yet they can't do nothing about it . That's why classes from home by way of online would be so important to kids who are going through this kind of situations.

The second reason is because of the parents who are in college and have many responsibilities, as taking care of their families and work, but still needs education.

Last year my sister had a baby, yet she was getting ready to graduate in college. She couldn't stop studying just because she got a baby. The online classes from home helped her a lot , because she was able to nurse her baby and take her classes at the same time.

The third reason is because of those kids that needs to go to school, but can't even dare get out of their houses because of their sickness. I had a friend who had a very bad disease that could't allow her go outside where there is sunlight because it could burn her skin. She wanted to go to school but she couldn't because of her health condition. The classes from home by way of online helped her finished her high school studies and graduated.

Some people may disagree by saying that students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online, because they won't have fun, make friends and other things, however i believe that they would benefit because a lot of those students who take classes from home by the way of online, ends up finishing their studies, and their wouldn't be any difference from the one who made it in school. Having friends and fun is good but ain't the priority , the priority is to get what's important and what will help in the future.

The benefit of having someone who shared wisdom and experience with you is that, people will show new things, you will get an opportunity to learn new things, and you won't feel like you are the only one who is experiencing this.

When my friend shared how she overcome being alone, because she couldn't speak English well, I realize that I can overcome being alone too. It was hard for me to talk with the other kids, because I was afraid that they will laugh at me, because I couldn't speak well, and then my friend says ""try to talk with them, otherwise you won't be able to speak with them,"". After that, she told me If I want to communicate, I need to be confident. Like that, She shared her experience.

The another benefit is that you can learn new things from the person who shared their wisdom to you. When they tell you about their experience, you will gain strength from it and you won't be afraid to do new things. When the people who tell you about their experience see you doing new things, they will support you, so that your experience will be memorable.

There are times when you feel like you are the only one who is experiencing this, but when someone tells you about their story, you will feel that you are not the only one who is feeling like this. When they shared their story, you will gain an opportunity to make new friend. You two will share your feeling about the experience and become closer. On the other hand, the funny and the sad stories will make you two have fun while you talk.

Since you know that there are a lot of reasons to share your experience, I wish you could use them to share your wisdom in the future. Don't you think it is the time for you to seek and ask other people's experience?                  ",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.5,4.0

""your character will be what you yourself choose to make of it. that quote along changed my mindset, many people would disagree with John and his way of thinking but i personal agree with what he wrote,theres a lot of true behind his words, People shouldn't focus about others opinions or let bad experiences or events shape its character. I personal believe characters arent beyond our control after all we are the ones that control our way of thinking and reacting to them. My self has seen my tree closes friends Generic_Name,Generic_Name and Generic_Name ended up really bad after they decide to let bad events,experiences, and opinions shape the way of their characters.

Generic_Name one of my closest friend decided to let one big events shape his character and at the end everything went wrong for my dear friend. When he was a little kid he contently got hit by his parents in he grew up mad and he started using violence at school he would get in trouble all the time and his parents would get super mad and would use violence against him too they say it was to ""teach him a lesson"" everything went like that for him until many years passed and he got married and he contently used violence every time she did something wrong, he was mad about what its parents did to him so he would always hit his wife until one day he end up killing her and himself.

Generic_Name my other close friend let experiences shape his character in a bad way.

when he was a young man falling a love with pretty girls many of those girls just wanted to play with his feelings. Those girls never took him seriously until one day he got tired of the way girls would treat him and he loose feeling and he become just like those girls he didn't like at first.

I extremely disagree with those schools that are offering distance learning for students because students wouldn't be benefit from attended classes from home the students just will be worth probably, they would like to take online classes but then they wouldn't attend they might be sleep, and they wouldn't care about the online classes.

The several schools that are offering online or video conferencing classes to students, those schools are doing that in the worse way, because those schools that are offering online classes just would make the students more lazy to attend to school and to receive classes with the teachers at schools, but I believe that students better attend to school than to receive online classes because attending to school the students get an opportunity to know others students and make new friends, and being at home receiving the online classes students don't get the opportunity to know, and meet new people from the same age as them so that's why I believe that those schools that are offering the distance learning to students to receive online classes are doing in a bad path.

Although some say that students should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is much better, because students don't has to attend to school and receive the classes with teachers, actually students shouldn't attend to classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because students wouldn't learn the much as they learn at schools with teachers, and some students doesn't have internet or electronic devices at home to attend for online classes.

Some say that students should attend to online classes or video conferencing. One reason, school offer that option because they don't want to student waste time to attend to school and they believe that students would be benefit receiving classes from their home. However, students can have more time to sleep for those who work until midnight can be a benefit receiving those online classes, but to those students that doesn't work it would not be a benefit even though it will be worth because they just will waste their time on the phone all day and even in the night too because they wouldn't have to wake up early and get ready to attend to school.

I extremely believe the opposite, students shouldn't attend to online classes or video conferencing because students will just waste their time at home and not taking the classes on their computers or others electronic devices. Otherwise, Some others students doesn't have the same benefits as the others have for example: some students doesn't have the sufficient money or the same opportunity as the others to buy an electronic device such as computer to receive the online classes, so those students has to attend to school and receive classes with the school personal, that's one reason why I extremely disagree with some schools option like the learning distance. Another reason, attending to school students learn more faster than being at home with a computer because when they are receiving the classes on the computer they will check their social media at the same time as they are taking classes. However, attending to school students can learn many new words from the school personal and leaning new words can be such a great benefit.

In conclusion,

however some say that attend to the distance learning is better, but I extremely believe the opposite students shouldn't attend to the distance learning, because that wouldn't be a good benefit in their education, and in their knowledge students that take the distance learning they wouldn't learn the same way or the much as they learn when they attend to school and the teachers teach.

I disagree with the distance learning that some schools offer to students because the distance learning it wouldn't be a benefit for students who attend to the option distance learning it would be just worth it because they would not learn that much and probably they will not pay attention to what on the classes are teaching to them.

Do you think that this would benefit students? I believe that it would not benefit students because of technology distraction, student behavior, and the different in capacity and ability for a student to understand things.

First reason, technology is an useful tool that people can use to learn or discover things, but it can be a huge distraction on young people. Today the technology is everywhere and it has everything which make it a powerful distraction for student's. Also, the students can copy any work from the internet while they are taking their online classes. The students will not learn anything if they copy every single work from the internet. Most students on school classes get distracted really easy by something around him, and also get bored when the teacher explain a new theme. I believe that is going to be more bored and distracted being at home alone doing conference and watching videos about the class. My home can distracted me more than my phone or computer, most kids have a video game, TV, family, and so others things that can catch their attention.

Second reason, student behavior can be a problem with online classes. A

lot of students do not respect or listen to their teacher at school, and

I am not wrong thinking that it would be the same at home with online classes. Most of this students do not listen to their teacher because they do not understand the way that the teacher explain or they do not like the teacher. So you can have an idea of how worst it can be i will give you an example, if a student do not like the subject of the day he can easily end the video conference with his teacher or he can just not listen to what he is explaining. The student can also not enter in to the class at the right time. I believe the there should be someone near the student to tell them what to do and how to do it.

Last reason, not all students have the same capacity to understand things. Not all the students have the same capacity to learn or understand by just watching videos or looking at pictures. I am a person who need someone to be physically near by so he or she can tell me how to do things. All the students that have this disability would be affected by this type of classes and this would make them to loose their credit on the class. At the same time this new type of classes is creating a barrier between students, teachers, and school.

Conclusion, the online classes do not benefit students because it can create a barrier between students, teachers, and school. The technology used for this programs can generate a distraction, and that can be a huge problem on future, the environment and behavior of the student can be a barrier too, and the different in capacity or ability to understand things can also represent an huge problem.

It's very important to have positive attitude in life in order to succeed in schools and collages. Student's who have positive attitude toward their studies are likely to succeed in life.

One of the major difference is when successful businessman goes through hardships they keep positive attitude and try to execute the problem and it leads them to success and who are not successful they simply give up and gain bad attitude.

Once you go through many situations it will be helpful to be inspired and think in someones life.

There are so many different opinions and ways to influence someone, they can be reasons or things that happened in the life of a person that will not necessary be inspired by a example of someones action, or life. Also a inspiration can make you feel confidence in a situation were you think you do not know what to do. The influence of a person can always be helpful.

A example is only main thing to influencing others, there are many different ways to inspired people. One example that I think is, that they can be moments were you do not need someone to inspired you, you need to think your situation because you are going to try to make it better by the way you think is the right decision for you.

Another example that I think of is, that we are humans and we are going to make mistakes and the people needs to learn from their mistakes, they can be many ways of trying to inspired a person but there times were you do not even think of someone to inspired you.

When people think of a inspiration or a motivation to do something they do not realize that they probably have been though the same situation but everyone is different, things may work for that person but that does not mean that it can benefit you, it should just be to see it as an example and try to make it better for you and get the positive things.

Sometimes it is just an coincidence that they have gone throng the same situation, and they feel identify not necessary inspired, it can also be a way to see how people can have many different ways to handle a situation, like what did I did that that person handle it different than from what I went through if it was the same situation, what can a make different if that situations happens again.

Is that there times that they feel touch by the way there life, or situation is similar to someone who when throng the same situation, it can be inspired by the way that they went throng the same problems, feel identify with something that happened to a friend, a family member, or them self. There are times that just by the action that someone can know, can feel, can think they way they felt in that situation, can be so influence by them, for knowing that you have not been the only one that went though that.

But it can be helpful to have someone that can inspired some one with there experience, sometimes people do not know what else to do they feel like there the only ones that have gone through the same situation, and a inspiration of a person can help them feel that they have someone who has been through that and that if they did it they can do it. It can also just be in there head that they think they need someone as an example just to be better or to feel confident with them self.

There always going to be good or bad moments sometimes you experience something that can make them be that person who inspires, I think it can definitely inspired someones action. A behavior can influence others, but everyone has different ways to think and it is not necessary if they watch someone doing a positive or negative thing will influence them is all in they way they want to act, the kind of person they are and the way they think.

Furthermore, benefits is what you want in life, it happens everywhere: jobs, schools, and physical health. Nowadays, people want more benefits then just one. By multitasking, these opportunity help there job more easy, but some times not so easy. when you are doing more than one skill: a promotion and a rise(money) can come as a reward. That being said, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you already mastered, you will never grow"" is not all true. People can have 2, 4 or maybe 8 skill that can show what they got.

In the end, there are a lot of ways to ensure that people can go beyond than anything. Pass down your skill in next gen, a challenge to prove them self that they are worthy, and benefits for being a multitasker is one thoses reason that he/she is something special. Doing beyond what you master, can make you grow. Never stop of what you love to do in life.            ",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,2.5,3.5
5C69070E1E48,"Students would benefit and not benefit from being able to attend classes from home is because you can stay at home ,not distraction,not friends or groups,tools from school that you may need,students can cheat.

Students would benefit from being able to attend school from home because you can stay at home and by staying at home you can wake up late for school. There is some students that hate waking up early for school that's one of the reasons of having the opportunity to take your classes in online. Staying at home you can be eating whatever you want there is not going to be teachers telling you that you can't eat. There might be people that doesn't have the transportation to go school and get in time for school and because children doesn't like waking 6 AM in the morning. That chance to take classes at online many students would prefer having online classes.

Other reason why students would benefit by attending classes from home is because there is not distraction at your home you can be at your room alone without no one to distract you when you're taking your classes or when you're taking a very important test. By being alone at home you can concentrate more about the things that you're learning because your friends are not there with you to distract you with another things.

Like I said there is not benefit too of having classes in online because students doesn't have friends or a group of friends to share their ideas. There is children that may need a group or a friend to talk about their ideas in classes or maybe you have a problem with something and you don't have no one to help you ,and by having not classmate it might be boring being alone.

students may need tools from school for example you need to read a book and you don't have one because you just don't own books at home and that's why I think it would not benefit because in school you have a library you can go there to find a book and there is different types of books students can pick.

Other reason why it would not benefit the students is because they can cheat.

students can cheat at everything because you don't have a teacher that is taking care that the student don't cheat at a test. If the students doesn't want to do a class he can can pay someone to make it for then ad pass it for them.

Different people might have another opinion about taking classes at home but I think there is benefit and not benefit because students can use this opportunity to waste their time or take advantages about having classes at home. In my opinion there will be some students that will take this serious and do the right thing.

5C72AB0B1232,"What's a career? a career is an occupation or a profession that someone do. People can start their career at any time in life. It's a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because career would prepare students for what they want to become in the future, and it can help students learn more skills and experience when they work with others.

Firstly, career can prepare students for what they want to become in the future. Consider someone who wants to become a doctor. People who want to become doctors usually work at the hospital so they can watch how doctors do their work. For example, Generic_Name was a student at Generic_school and he wanted to become a doctor one day. Generic_Name started to work at the hospital after his parents told him that they didn't have money to put him in college. Generic_Name learned a lot of of things about doctors before he went to college; and when he went to college, it wasn't so hard for him because most things about doctors seemed familiar. Generic_Name graduated with a bachelor's degree and he became a good doctor. This proves that committing to a career at a young age can be helpful in the future.

Secondly, Career can help students learn more skills and have more experience of things in life. for example, Generic_Name loves when someone plays guitar and he always say that he wish he knew how to play guitar. Generic_Name was hired after he applied on a part time job which was called "" Teen fun time"". it was a good job for Generic_Name because they could teach him many different things including guitar. Generic_Name was taught how to play guitar by some guy who liked how Generic_Name was a hard worker and nice to everyone. After hard months of training, Generic_Name could play guitar by himself. people loved how Generic_Name played guitar, therefore, his manager made him play at the entrance of the building so people can enjoy while entering the building. Generic_Name was able to draw, paint, and cook after he worked at the Teen fun time for a while. Teen fun time made Generic_Name a good guitar player and a great cooker.

Some people may say that it is not a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because some teenagers turn into disrespectful children to their parents when they receive their first checks. For example, Generic_Name was hired at the boys and girls club. After he received his first check, he could not do anything his parents ask him to do and he would claim that he's going to be late to work. His parents did not like it and it made them unhappy sometimes. However, committing to a career at a young age is good because it teaches teenagers a lot of stuffs they need to know in life. Teenagers also make money from a career, which means that they can help their parents with small needs like buying clothes for themselves and shoes.

In conclusion, a career at a young age prepares students for their future career. If someone want to become a pilot, they have to work at the airport so they can get some ideas on how planes fly. Committing to a career at a young age can help students learn more skills and have more experience on things in life. By working with people, students can learn new stuffs from people they don't know. This proves that committing to a career at young age is good for students.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
5CF895003869,"""Unless you try something beyond what you already mastered,you will never grow"" I agree with this argument because if people never try something new,they will never know if they choose the best option because never try. In my opinion be afraid is the worse thing in the world. In my experience afraid is the most thing that I feel stoped me because if I am afraid I never try something beyond things I have,even knowing that it can be better for me. Also if people try to do something new,they will learn more things than they already know. Keeping trying is the best option for all people in the world. Does not matter if they fail or they are wrong,and finally I agree with the statement because people will never know if they will get better opportunities in a job,college or in general life,if they never try or they never force theirselves to be successful.

First,if people never try something new,they will never know if the way they choose,was the best option because they will be always with the doubt thinking about what could happen if they were tried. They will never be brave enough if they never try to do something new because they are afraid. In my opinion the best example is when teenagers are in school,specially people who are from Central American countries,they are afraid because they do not speak the internacional language ""Enlglish"" so,they prefer do not try something like; speak with their classmates or even with their teachers,if they have any doubt they will never ask because they are afraid. They just do not want to try it because they are afraid classmates or teachers laugth about them,even when the teacher are good with them because some teachears are a kind of rude,not all of them but there are some of them. In my personal experience,the last year I had two teachers who was very rude with me and my friend. We were in our class when she asked for something that I did not understand and I asked her what was that,and she said that if we do not speak English we need to go back our conutry,and my other teachers was angry because in my class all the people was speaking Spanish and she said the same thing that my another teacher said before ""If you do not speak English just go baxk to your countries"". These are examples why teenagers are afraid to try new thins and they just prefer stay quite,but the only way to know how things are going to take place,is try it. If people try new things,they will be better person that they already are because they will figth for the things they want,they will be successful by theirselves.

Second,if people try to do new things,they will learn more things that they already know. When people try something new the results can not be always positive. They can fail,but at least they were brave to try something that they never try before and they have to be proud of theirselves even if they did not get what they want. However if they did not get what they want,they learned something new because people learn from the mistakes. Mistakes are the best way to learn because you will know what to do the next time that you try the same thing until you get what you want. Does not matter if you are wrong,you will learn because the life is a lesson that you learn every single day. In my experience when my uncle wants to get his license,we went to the DMV so many times but he always fail his test. We went to the DMV about five times till the day he pass his test,but he never give up even knowing that he can fail the last time we went,he wants to try it again and keeping trying still they have his license with him. So do not get frustrate if you do not get it the first time you try,just keeping trying,you will get it.

Finally,is people will never know if they will get better opportunities if they never try. So many people in the wolrd are looking for better opportunities but the most of the time they never get it,the only reason is because they never try. When people want to get a new job where they need to do something that they never did before they choose do not try it because they do not want to be wrong,but if they never try it,never will be better,never will get a best opportunity to be successful. Everybody is afraid about fail and fail is the most comun reason what people stop to doing something they want,but fail is not the worse thing in the world,the really worse thing is not try it. People can get better opportunities also in the college,they need to try something maybe the things can work good for them. Life is the best gift that we have,we can be sad,we can be happy,we can be whatever we want,and do whatever we want to do,but need to keep try it. If something does happened just like people want,keeping try it to get perfeccion. To get what they want,they need to force theirselves untill get and be who really want to be. Life is the best teacher we have. The life teach us be brave,be proud of ourselfs,be best person than we were yesterday,but life also teach us to figth to get better opportunities,and better lifestyle.

In conlcusion,try new things is better than stay with the things people already have. Try is the best option that people have,does not matter what poeple say about the way people decide to take,everybody is going to choose the best way for their lives. So keep trying,on that way you will mastering more things than you already have. Does not matter how good you are or how many things you already have. You need to looking for most better thing,better opportunities. People do not have to be afraid,people need to be brave to get what they want. Do not give up if the things do not take the place that you want,just keeping trying. Always will be better try new things,to continue grow up than stay where you are with the things you already have. Better life,better opportunities,best person in the world. I am very agree with the statement,and you need to be agree,too. ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you already mastered,you will never grow"".",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5
5D7D1445A7CF,"Smooth Sails do not make Skillful Sailors!

In my opinion, anyone can succeed if they work hard and strive for what they want to achieve. Nothing is a piece of cake. There is handwork and determination behind every successful person. One should have a specific aspiration in their life, and should not do something because they are forced to. There will be a satisfaction if we make a mistake in the work we like to do. We try to find solutions and solve the problem, but if we do something our parents want us to, there will be no contentment.

School life should be the time where all the students should relax and have fun in addition to studying. It is not supposed to be a burden to anyone. Every kid has a right to receive the same education and programs. Discrimination should not be shown to anyone. They should be allowed to do whatever they want to, but should be taken care of so that they do not do something wrong. American school systems are perfect for students because they get to study and at the same time they can take courses they are passionate about. They have a chance to learn new things about the career they want to pursue. The balanced system helps them to manage stress level and also concentrate on how their future will unfold.

Some schools in the United States also allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of traditional four years. There is no point in students graduating one year early to work or enter to college soon. How does graduating one year early matter? This increases nothing but stress and restlessness.

Some students wish to do that not because they want to, but their parents force aspirations on their children. I do not say that it is wrong whatever parents do, but I say that this is not a right way to expect their kids to be successful. All the students need recreational time where they can forget all the school stress and enjoy their time, but parents desire to see their kids as the most successful person, is not letting them to be happy like other kids. Higher grades always does not matter. All that matters is that how can we use in ow much knowledge we attained from the school and how can we use that knowledge in the future. In order to finish high school early, the kids are required to take summer classes and spare their time in the evening. This is not something that is useful for a kid. They need some time to relax their mind, so that concentrate in their studies. They should be able to take their favorite electives as those classes can help them to be successful in the future.

I know an incident where one of my cousin graduated early from high school in order to attend college early. He was really smart until high school junior year. He had a great knowledge of what is happening around the world. He would share those with everyone and help us gain some knowledge too,but at the end of the junior year, he was so into graduating early that he did work hard and finally got into a college. He regrets that decision now as he did not learn so many things in the last year of high school that are stressing him now. If everyone finish high school in the traditional way, they will know everything about college and how it works. Then they can do whatever they want to and have at least some knowledge about it. We often hear news about how students commit suicide as they are stressed about academics, so I think they should not do whatever they do not like, and instead work on what they desire for.

Hard work is the key to success, but that does not mean that everyone should work hard on something they do not like. instead they should really work hard to achieve what they want. Our aspirations should not be impacted by anyone. If we have our own goal and ways to succeed them, we should follow that way and make sure that we become the most successful individual in that particular field. ",4.5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.5,4.5
5E3EA4C47C9A,"The author Ralph Waldo Emeson wrote, ''to be yourself in a world that constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment .''

I agree with Emerson statement about individuality because I've actually seen people end up in big problems tryng to pretend for the world. . In the world we live in we can't even hide from the act because its in out tv's and advertisement . If I'm being honest there is no benefit from this whole act of changing for the world in order for them to like you .

My favorite rap artist is Tekashie Sixnine who has recently been on the charts and hot 100 in America for his songs .

The main reason he got all those views and streams was because he was puttting up a front and prenting to being someone else in his lyrics . This artist has even been also been skating on thin ice for awhile . He has also created and posted on the internet videos of him doing crimes which lead to his arrest in november 20 2018.Tekashie is now serving jail time for trying to prove to the world that he was a big time gangster.

My other reason for me to agree with Emerson statement about indivuality was because our lives has changed now that the advertisemnt is telling you change and look a certain way . For example I use instagram every single day and fifthy percent of the time the ads are about weight pills and cool clothes which have gang related logos on it now people buy these clothes and are'nt even part of gang related activity because the market is influence you to buy it . People can easly fall for the trap thats why you should always be yourself no matter what .

Now to my last reason as a human being I've made mistakes and I've learned you always have to be yourself from those mistakes. When you are trying to act a type of way the life choices you will be making and friends you hang around will matter . You can be acting for your friends and end up in jail due to to the way yo were acting to make your friends happy. I think its much better to be yourself and too see that as a accomplishement because we are all now in a tech phase were web presents is a big deal and people go at any risk too achieve that goal . I for one can say that it is hard to not act like anyone becuase I came from Canada to america and I didnt change and it benefiting me because I making better choices .

These are the reason why I agree with the statement author Ralpgh Waldo Emerson made about individuality .I also think that everone thats trying to achieve something good and do something with their lives should aways keep in mind to be there selfs no matter what . ",4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0
5EF21F142C51,"Have you ever wanted to seek others opinion on a choice that you had to make?.Seeking others opinion on a choice you have to make is right. I think seeking others opinion on a choice that you have to make is good,because people can help you make the right choice for your self,learn what they would do if they had to make the same choice as you,and learn new ways on making that choice

One way you can seek someone's opinion on a choice that you have to make,is by asking people what they would do if they had to make the same choice as you. by doing this you will known their opinion on making that choice. Most people don't ask others on what choice they should make,because they think that people would make fun of them on making a choice on a certain topic. For example when someone has to make a choice on if they would buy some toy against buying a video game. I too have been in that type of problem. Another example is making a choice between wanting to get something you like but there are more than one things you could get and your friend making fun of what you say you want to get. To sum up my first reason of why it is good to seek people's opinion on making a choice,because you then can use others opinion to make your choice.

Another reason of why you should seek others opinion to make a choice is to get help on making the correct choice. One way you can get help with deciding on a choice is by learn the steps of make a choice. One way I learned the steps of making a choice was from a book my mom had got me to read. The steps of making a choice are first think of all the choices you have,then checking which ones you like and they suit you,and finally making your choice!.One other way is to ask friends and family to help you decide on your choice. A example for asking your friends and family to help you make you choice is,One day you had went to the video game store and you see two video games you really want but you only have $70 to spend,so you ask your brother on which one you should get and he says the racing one,but you don't known if you should save more money so next time you get both or just buy one now.

Lastly,My final reason for why seeking others opinions to make a choice is right,because you can learn different ways of how you can make your choice. One way you can make your choices is by finding all the possible outcomes. Another way you can decide on what choice is by asking friends and family give you ideas on the different choices you have and which ones are the best for you. An example from my life I have is,one time I was going to the ice shop and me and my brother did not known what favor to get,so I said why don't we try the new favor,because we had not ate before,so I think my idea for what we should get was good,because I came up with a new choice that we never had thought of before.

In Conclusion,seeking people's opinions on making a choice is good. I think seeking others opinions on a choice you have to make is right,because you can learn what they would have done if they had to make the same choice,help you make the right decision,and learn new ways on making that choice.",4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0
603863409B06,"Most of students live with so much stress for study so hard and each time they depress more. They need to take a break sometimes. May breath fresh air and entertain themselves in something that can motivate to follow forward. I agree that students should be required to take one of these classes. It's very important to be creatives in some moment. Taking that type of classes make to students being relax forgetting for a moment the problems, helps to lose some fears, and above all they can benefit in their future.

Arts in general can help to people who can need a break of all the problems they have everyday and thus not live with stress. I have a friend who live with so much stress for every thing he pass. He try to be the best in all of his classes, but that cause more stress on him. For that reasons, he decide to take one or two free hours everyday to relax himself. The best decision he take was to choose a music class. After he start to take the class, he told me: ""The guitar class is very amusing and interesting. It helps me to forget all the problems that cause me stress. It was the best decision I take."" Now I see how my friend is so happy and calm after he start his guitar class. He changed because he found something that he really likes to do and that helps to be relax.

The performance class helps students to being more sociable with the others and lose one or more fears. I'm a girl with a lot of fears, but my biggest fear is to talk with others. That fear start to appear with the passing of the years. I was not a timid girl when I was a kid, but little by little I think more in what the rest think about me. That's why I decide to take a drama class. I need to confess that the first classes was very hard for me because I didn't speak with anyone, but with the passing of the days I start to speak with my companions. They were kind with me so that was more easy to me to have a conversation with someone.

The art classes can be very important to some people because it helps to have a good future. I have a teacher who I always show her my drawings and sculptures because she is my favorite teacher. She is not a art teacher, but I know she appreciate me so much because every time we talk she told me: ""Your drawings are so beautiful, in the future you can be a teacher of art or sculpture. I know you are going to have a great future doing what you really likes."" I think a lot of what she told me and probably after I finish NOVA I'm applying to some university about art, and maybe I can apply for a grant about art.

In conclusion, it's better if students take a music, a drama, or an art class so that can relax and have fun at the same time. Most of the people believe that type of classes should be electives because some students don't like to play a instrument, act, or even drawing. But I think that every student needs to take one of that classes to leave all the stress away. That type of classes are for students to turn on that creative part that they have inside and can have fun, not to being boring and stressing every time.

However, cell phones have different types of effects worldwide , it can cause people to become slow in their learning and thinking abilities, it can cause vision problems, and it can also be a distraction for everyone.

By letting students use their cell phones in classrooms for educational purposes can cause a big impact in their physical life and also academic. Experts have discovered that ninety four percent of the students in school use their cell phones to cheat in schoolwork and exams. Most of the students in school struggle in their way to collage or because they didn't used the right method for learning or finding information when they had schoolwork, they didn't developed their thinking ability that at the end it became something hard for them to remaster. This method effects millions of students around the globe when they get out of their education system, this is one of the reasons why a percentage of students struggle in their lifetime when they end their education.

In addition, experts have discovered that when teenagers use cell phones in daily routines in a certain amount of time they might experience vision problems or they can also end up blind, this is all caused by the reflection of the light from their cell phones, this is why experts recommend schools to teach students with books and not to let them use technology because they might experience vision problems at least once in their life time. The cell phone use in classrooms for educational purpose can become an addiction or a distraction for students in school or in their life outside school , they can develope a routine when they won't be able to live without their cell phones and sometimes this cell phones addictions guide people to end up getting hit by cars or by getting involve into car crash accidents, because they were too distracted on their cell phones while driving or crossing the streets.

I absolutely agree with the statement. For this reason I am going to provide you some details that support my opinion. Hopefully, at the end of this essay you will agree that attitude is the key to progress in life.

First, I think that to have a wonderful attitude in life will help you to be confident, because, people surely will trust on you; besides, if you have an exemplary attitude, you are demonstrating to others who you are and how your behavior is.

Second, I have been seen that people who have a better attitude, they succeed in life. In addition, it will develop your skills to make more friends; for instance, supposing that you are in High School, and you have resentful behavior with your classmates, what will happen is that rarely they will talk to you, the reason is because they already know about your behavior.

Third, I have read some segments from online resources; reportedly, more than a half people (70%) who have a filthy attitude, in the future they become pessimistic people. By another hand, if you demonstrate your nice attitude, you will have better opportunities in life.

I leave of my country in October 25, 2015. I was in Guatemala for 15 day. I feeling sad, because I don't know who are the other people came in the group. After I was in Mexico for others 10 days. I not eat anything, because I don't liked the food that they gived me, also i was for anothers days in a place called Matamoros is close to the river that with to cross to came to this country. After to cross the river a men of imigration take me to the imigration office and he start to call to my parents to ask about my imformation. I was happy to speak to my parents. My parents pay a ticket to travel to here. I cray of the emotion to see my parents after a few years.

Second, I went to Generic_City with my sister and my friends. This is my second experience tha is impossible to change. I was happy to share time with my friends and my sister in Generic_City. We wented to Time Squared. We take many pictures infront of the tower. After we walked to the red stairs we sit there to look anything and we continued walked to go to the anothers beautiful places that the City has.

Finally, my first impression in my first day in the School. I was happy to go to the School. I feeling sad, because when the teacher start to explain something in English i don't know what she said and I ask to my friends that they speak Spanish they start to explain me what the teacher explain in English. Every day in Schood I learned somenthing different and I feeling happy. Every day when I came to the house after School I speak in English with my lilttle brother than he born here. He teach me English sometimes.

In conclusion, this are my three impressions that impossible to change in my own experiences. I believe that the experiences that we has in the life are only that never past again is only one time.",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,3.5
62102D1B1A52,"Do you agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? If the statement about the role that failure plays in the pursuit of success, it could help people to do better things. People can have a better future. Also people can feel more positive.

First, people can do better things. For example, my cousin Generic_Name had a soccer game at Generic_City, she and her team was talking about how they will need to play on the field, they needed to play better than the other games because the team that she was going to play against is one of the best teams that plays on that field and also her team needed to have more goals scores to keep being on the list so the can win the championship, so when they started to play they was playing like they planned it before the game and at the end of the game they won and everyone was happy because they never thought that they was going to have the chance to win that team, but they never give up.

Next, people can have a better future. For example, my parents after they got married they always wanted to have a better future for them and for all there kids they was going to have, so both of them was planning to cross the board from Mexico to the United States, so after a week they finally cross the board and they was living with my grandma, when my dad started working after a couple of months my dad bought a new house and they started to live there, then they were saving money to buy more stuffs because they was going to need to buy a lot of things like: beds, clothes, shoes, table, chairs, etc. After some years they finally got everything they needed and they had two kids and finally got to know that they will have a better future.

Last, people can feel more positive. For example, when my cousin talk to her coach about that I wanted to be in a team of soccer, the coach called me and told me that he wanted me to play soccer with his team the next weekend, but before that I told him that I was not that good at playing soccer and he told me that I will learn easier and faster if I go to practices, so when I went to my first game I was so nervous about that I was not going to play good as the other girls do, and I did not wanted them feel bad if we lose for my fault, but I kept playing and I never thought that at my first game I was going to make a goal, but overall I kept going from failure to failure and never loss my enthusiasm and that is one of the reasons that helped me feel more positive of myself.

In conclusion, I believe that going to failure to failure will not loss the enthusiasm, at the same time it could be one of the betters reasons by making people do things better, make people have a better future, and also people can feel positive by them self.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0
622ECD91DA0C,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. This statement is false because you can't judge a person based on their appearance because sometimes people are just having a bad day and when you become friends with them you find out how that person actually is.

For example, you meet a person that has a lot of tattoos and you have a bad impression of them, but then, you interact with that person and you find out that he/she is not what you thought; therefore you can't judge a person based on their appearance. I think that how a person dresses doesn't determine the type of person someone is, but if you let someone to express their feelings your opinion on them will completely change.

In addition, when you become friends with someone and you talk with them, sometimes they tell you that when you met them, they weren't having a good day. Also, what a lot of people don't understand is that everyone have problems and they don't know what other people are passing through.

Sometimes you have a bad impression of someone because of what other people say and the opinion you have on them do not change until you start talking to that person, I think that this an error that a lot of us make, we judge a person without knowing how they actually are. For example, once I had a friend that talked really bad about a girl and I believed everything he said, but when I started talking to her, she was completely different from what this one friend had told me about her.

In conclusion, people are not always what they seem to be and you can't judge them on how they look. I think everyone should first try to get along with someone and then, they can judge. That's why I think that you can change first impressions.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0
6253F73FBABF,"As my opinion i disagree because ""you could be someone beyond the world"" if you are positive of yourself. you could take a risk of many things you want to do in life and become something wonderful of it. you can graduate and became someone you wanted to, thats growing masterly of no matter how many times you have try but where has got you.

Be a person with so many mistakes but the also is going to learn from them and,you will still come back up and start trying again.

If you have done so many things and you still feel like no other person is going to appreciate of the things you have done and then you feel like theres nothing that you could do that could be good enough for nobody. Dont stop trying do not ever make yourself feel like you gotta do things for other people just be great how you are with or without mistakes you could be wonderful and make yourself happy and proud of them.

In life theres so many responsibilities you have to take care of and no matter what does responsibilities are you still take care of them you dont give up because if you do you wouldnt be able to go to school and becoming someone in life you wouldnt be able to to eat you wouldnt be able to work or to do many things but you stills do them because you have to and because you do become someone out of them you become a person that graduates a person that works everyday to put food in the table a person that after words its gonna be proud for they have done and that is always good enough and that you grow everyday from it. you could become a person that could afford a car with nobody asking help and you grow everyday with or without people because you are strong like that. theres another step where family comes along and you got to be able to take care of your family you got to get your family food you gotta get then clothes you gotta get them shoes you gotta get them the most important things they need and you still get your family out of any circumstances you still get up every morning to get your money and help your family or each other up and you still grow from not just growing from it but you also get to know how something people get to appreciate what you really do for them. honestly you grow of some many ways you didnt have no idea you could but you still get through it.

be someone in life is about growing little things you have left out to make them bigger. Believing in yourself is always something that is gonna help you to a positive person.

Making good choices in your life is another part of you not just because sometimes you learn from them or where they could take you but how you get when you learn from your bad choices and how sometimes you react and you say to your self that you just want for your self to do good things.

Dont ever in your life say that your things are never worth of any tries you have made because the're really are worth of every single part of your life there are step you always take. If you want to be a great person dont thought of yourself you know you could do it you could grow of it other people would love so any wonder things and person you really are.

being positive of your self is the most amazing thing you could do like for example you could be positive and just be like i will pass a test or i will pass but you are just being positive that you are sure you could do it because not you only are positive of yourself you are also showing that you could believe that you can do it. being organist with your self is less stress full because you dont got worry about get so many things out of your way the same day. Happy is showing every body that no matter they think about you you dont pay any attention to them even if you have try your best to become friends and it still not even working out so you just gotta leave the person and just let it be you just gotta show the person that you did try and if for that person your friendship wasnt good enough then dont bother. Unless you really dont try at all you will never grow even if you have put your best effort your best part you will grow and become a person that others are just going to admiral you.

could you really learn from life yes!! you can be aware of it but hey!! we are not perfect nobody was born perfect we can make as many mistakes we can or we could be the greats but no theres nobody perfect that could tell you that you cant do something when you know more then anybody else that you can and that you are not perfect. It doesnt matter how people make you feel at the end of the day it would only be you and your family and the effort to put on the things you want to become the best not perfect but the best. Sometimes is just matter of time for you to really tell yourself that you could try your hardest and not give because life is not about just being a completely fail nope you could tell youself you can do it because you got it.

62F7911DE51F,"Once author Ralph Waldo Emerson Said ""unless you try to do somthing beyond what you have masterd you will never grow"", and he is right. To truly understand what thee author is trying to is saying you must understand that to say that you have mastered something is to be able to do it without failer. In order to grow you must set goals for your self. Even if those steps that you take are small they help you walk the path of achiving greater things. Not everything comes easy it may take years to master or even learn, but with the right amount of confidence and self confodince you can reach mastery.

If you can ride a bike than learn how to ride a mottercicel, if you are able to make a cupcake than learn how to bake a cake, if you know how to float then learnand teach your self how to swim. Small tasks like these can help you improve skills that you already know and have. By improving those skills you can reach higher places and do bigger things. Untill you push your self you will never reach the goals you set but with the right amount of dedication you can reach your goals and move beyond what you already know. Just becuase you can't do one small task doesn't mean that you can not master it you havr to keep trying and trying till you can master it but until then you will never grow. Now it's up to you to decide weather or not you want to grow as a person or not weather to grow or stay the same and never to achive your goals in life.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5

would you want to make your parents to feel disappointed,ll give another example people who like the same sex, theirs been so many stories an articles of people dying because their expressing them selves a lot of people are scared so they don't tell anyone so they become depressed they use a lot drugs to lose the pain but nothing ever works.

In my opinion i agree with Ralphh Waldo Emerson it's a amazing feeling to be yourself and not follow other people because at the end of the day you need to be doing things that make you happy not for other,your priories come first be who ever you want to be like and who ever you want you live one life.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0
64A9ECB1C55A,"Have you ever thought about asking other people for advice? Perhaps, people sometimes talk to more than one person because they will be able to know which is the best choice to go with, to find their next step, and that person will stop thinking about their choice too much.

FIrstly, the person will be able to know which one is the best choice to go with. I have exprienced it when I make a wrong choice. One time, I planned to clean the car. Than, I asked my parents about it, and they said that You should not clean the car because there is a lot of different diseases that are in the car. I said to myself that my parents are right because I can be sick, tired, and can have different kinds of diseases. Then, I decided that I will not going to clean the car. It is better to ask advise from the people that are your friend or family. Moreover, it will help you to make better choice in your life. One time, I decided to play video games with my friend, and I actually had a test after that day. My friend just ask me that if I have a test. I told him that yes I do have test tomorrow, then he give me an advice that you should not play any video games tonight because video games can make you tired, bored, and can't think about your question in the test. When I thinked to myslef that if I play video games, I will not be able to think on my test the next day of it. I recommend to ask good people fo an advice.

Secondly, the person will find their next step. I have exprience that when I don't find my next step, I would ask for advice from other people. Once, I did not know how to do my next step my math assighnment. I asked my friend that should I multiplie or add, she showed me a trick for an easier way to always find your step when you are stuck on that kind of question. I likly use that trick trick, and I mostly find my step. I recommend that a person will have to ask for advice if they even know the answer. In addition, there was a time that my sister had a problem with her next step. It was an important assighnment so I did'nt help her but, I give some advices and that helped her a lot to, fix her step thet she was stuck. I will say that a person should ask people for an advice.

Lastly, the person will stop thinking about their choice too much. I have expreinced it when I think about my choice so much. Once, I had a choice that I could take the Mock writing SOL or I could get the original and a higher level writing SOL. I always thinked which one should I go for, and one day I was angry for no reason and that was because of how much I thinked about which one I should go with. I asked my dad about this and he said that you should take the original because this is a challenge for you. Additionally, I said to myslef that if I get this writing SOL and if I pass this, my parents ahould give at least a gift and I said to my dad that this challenge is great. Again, I recommend people to ask advice from someone to know and research more about something.

In conclusion, people somtimes talk to more than on person because they will be able to know which is the best choice to go with, to find their next direction, and that person will have to extract his thinking about their choice too much. Consenquently, I would always recommend to ask an advice from a person you know or knows the best.",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0
64B53DEF0467,"Technology is good for many stuff. For example, technology is good for research, homework or otherstuff. But, they their is a negative effects on people's lives. Technology can be use for bad stuff like in internet, researching bad stuff in the website. But like I said technology is good for many stuff

Technology is good for research because when your doing a project or study for test. But you dont know anything you just research in the website. Also good for your homework, you can find the answer or get informtion rewrite on your word. But, technology has negative effects on people's lives.

(I was talking a the computer).

Technology is good for play game. For example, I have a Playstation Four and so many video game. I play all day not get bored. But then, much too technology can cost your eye to get hurt or loose your eye sight. Their a other thing is bad for us as a teen. We waste so much time on video game rather spend time on doing our homework,prove writing skill, reading.

technology (phone) is good for communication with other people in fairy away places. For example, My family live in Generic_City, but my aunt and unlce live in Generic_City.

65593BCE26BF,"Many schools have partnerships with local companies. It allow students to explore certain professions. Students needs a lot of stuff to success in life. Schools should have the qualities to help their students success.

Schools should have a partnership business to help all the students to reach their goals. Helping the students to improve their skills and give them time to improve their brains as well. Having a partnership is much easier, because members helps when its needed.

Partnership is easier, because if the business doesn't work out, then everyone will take the risk not only one person. Taking the risk alone is very hard, It's as hard as touching the clouds. Having all the risk alone is horrible, for an example it can causes living in the street or losing all the money that the person have. I want to live a good life when I grow up , so I won't like to take all the risk by myself. I don't want to lose all my money so I would be happy to have a partnership member to help me out. Plus Not working alone, I do not like to work alone in life. I would love to work with other people when I grow up.

Sharing Is one thing I like about partnership. It's not only sharing the risks, but sharing the good stuff too. Sharing ideas to make the profit better. Sharing money to grow the business. Yes, sharing is a really good thing in a partnership business. Partnership is not about loneliness, but its about happiness. Working alone is really boring , but by talking to the members of the partnership can be really fun. By doing that the members gets to know each other much more. I believe that all is it about is trust and happiness.

Some people might thinks that Partnership is not good. They believe that partnership business is not helpful at all, but they are wrong it is helpful. They think that the members might not get along with each other, and at the end the business will break down. Getting along with each other takes time, but picking the right people for the business is needed. People who thinks that partnership is bad they are actually wrong, but they have points though. Partnership is about learning new stuff from other people, and it's the most important thing in a partnership business.

A lot of schools now are having a partnership with local companies, which is a good thing. It will help students to improve their skills. It will also help the students to reach their goals and success in life. Plus having a partnership business is much easier, and

No one takes the risk alone. Schools should have the qualities to help the students success in their future life. ",2.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5

65CC82C9B3C9,"I I agree because people should have more time to rest mostly because the effect of the stress and the health of their body. Schools should be the same, they could have more time to do their homework and rest, because there is stress in children. In the majority of middle schoolers and high schoolers there is always stress and preoccupations about grades. Most of high school teenagers stress and worry about colleges if they got in or not. And by taking the four-day weekend we are reserving energy and resources, by not driving cars or motorcycles because of the toxic smoke a vehicle throws to the air we breath.

Sometimes some of the big businesses become of abusive or people's hours to get extra work done. It should be people's decision if they want to stay extra hours if they want to get their work done. People work to live and not live to work they somehow got to look for ways to provide themselves and sometimes their families. If they were to finish their jobs with everything done , they get to go home and be with their families.

Having the time off can be people to catch with work if they are behind or for teenagers to catch up with homeworks. School sometimes can be exhausting because some people could be depressed or stressed out to get their things done. Everyone can run out of energy especially when everybody expects for you to do good. Every single member of your family is always telling you to do good just to get things in life is very stressful. Working hard through four days it is more then enough to get work done if you put your mind to it.

People need the extra time to relax, because it is not good for the body mentally and physically. Working too much causes stress and grueling because thinking too much about work and worrying about the bills that they have to pay. By being worried too much can even cause you to go to the hospital so it would be not be good for your health. When you think about the things you have to do to support yourself you have to put yourmind to it and not slack if you want that advantage of thedays you are going to have work.

In conclusions I agree because people should have more time to relax and not stressed about their jobs and what they have to do. People get exhausted and start to worry about all of their responsabilities they have to do. Working for 10 hours is more then enough for a person. Sometimes teeagers and adults carry many preoccupations that they shouldn't worry about but they have to if it envolves them. Schools should be the same and not be so stressful, it could be dangerous to stress and not sleep because they worry about the responsabilities that have to be done.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

Daily we live the way we want to. But, sometimes we don't consider the important things that can make us success in life. Attitude can be one of those facts that can make us success. There are some specific reasons about the importance of attitude and why we should consider this or not a fact to success in life.

The importance of attitude is a fact to success in life. As we know, we need a possitive attitude to get some things in life. For example, in a job to get better opportunities we need a possitive attitude to develop our skills.

To live a healthy life. For example, if we have a possitive attitude we will avoid dangerous sickness.

Easies way to live. For example, being relaxed is a result of having a possitive attitude.

67D58F9FA53C,"I agree with the principal because that what he said said all students hood at lest participate on a sport,club,or after school activitis. The principal wants students tp join sports maybe because he want some students to get on shape or to atend some after school activitis for example like a dance club to see how students do and art club to see how students draw and students council. The yearbook like take pictures of all the teams,clubs,or groups the school has. or take photographs of all the teachers of the school like put what they do or what they teach students. School coincuals like take a photographs of them and write on the top what they do there names favoryte thing and others. And sports i do agree with the principal is for students can learn to do team work conumect with others and trying there best to win or at list not loss the game that's how they can learn and it shows the teacher how good there in one thing then the other

.And students council i don't now what that is or what it means but i think if like to help keep the school or help janutors, teachers,or the principal with something. And i agree again becaude people or example students need to get on shape learn how working out feels like and then when they grow older they would be like ""wow"" because school is not just learning math sciences sociol studes and laugen arts no,school is a aportuniti to now how life is and how it is ti work hard and trying our best to do or conplet something on life. Okay this off the topic that we are talking about okay, all most every billoner drop of of school and collage to start what they wanted to do and what there dream was the did not stop it they all went for it

Okay now this is back on the topic. I also disagree because some students need to do some at home like help there father or a family member o something of life or have to work in a reasterunt to help there family with bills or other thing like that is why some don't have the time to do any of dos after school activitis and others,or have to take care of a sibiling or a family member and don't have the time to stat for after school activitis for the cause of dos thing that I just said. And i disagree inone thing again some students just stay after school to finish a test,work,progetor a asy for the teacher or just stay to learn more about what there wanna do of the work or esy is wanna be about. But in one thing some not all students some hood really stay after like the ones that can't speak english, or the ones who need help on writing on english,or the ones who really need help to read on english .

Or the ones that want to learn more about a other laenguech they can just stay in the same class that they have the leangucj they want to learn about and just tell the teacher if they can stay after or not no if the teacher is gonna stay after for then they can stay after and learn more of the leanguch they are learning about. The students that are in sports they can just stay after pratising with other students on the soccer filled. And for the student council students can just do what the student council dos because i have no idia what is or what it means .

So what I am trying to say is that yes some students hood stay after school to participate on one of this activitys the principal has probited for them i can help them on soemthing not like help them alot but just a little for the students know how it is to do something.",2.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I want you to consider policy one for various reasons. The first reason why we should have cell phones is because some parents like to check up on there son's and that can't happen in policy two, but in policy one we can do that and if you are a parent wouldn't you like to check up on your son or daughter? Second, I don't see why we shouldn't be able to bring them at all because say we forgot our homework at home and say we already missed a day of homework and if we miss another one we will get a detention, we can just call our mom during lunch break or passing period and tell her if she can bring our home work. Lastly, say we are in a lock down because someone had a gun in the campus and the man or women cuts the power off so no one can call through the telephones we can just grab our cell phones and call the police.

68E75FD12673,"Have you ever been to a park ? Chances are you have, It doesn't matter what kind but you most certainly had fun right. Going to parks Is always fun, mostly because of the activities you do at the park to have fun. At the park you always find a fun activity to do, and people enjoy doing those fun activities because you get to play with other people, you are able to make new friends, and most of those activities can help you live a healthy life.

When people go to the park the tend to do fun activities, and most of the time they play those activities with friends and or other people. And when you play those activities with someone else you can have more fun. Another good reason for playing with someone else Is you also get to talk to them. And when you start playing with someone It could lead up to more people joining, and will make It even more fun. So remember when you go to the park try to bring a friend so you both can have lots of fun at the park.

People like going to the park to do fun activities, and when they go they often start to talk to new people. When they talk to new people theres a high chance of them becoming friends, So another reason why they enjoy the park Is they can make new friends. And who doesn't like to make friends, as a result they can meet up at the park and have fun together. And then they'll eventually make a more friendly status with each other. So going to park can be enjoyed in different ways, theres a chance you might just make a new friend.

Finally my last reason why people go to the park Is they can enjoy the park and the activities and also live a healthy life. You might not even notice that most of the activities we do at the park can be positive and help us with a healthy life. Its Is always a positive thing to live a healthy life you can do so much by keeping your life healthy. Thats why most people like going to the park you can have fun and be healthy at the same time.

6ACB38C6577C,"Should a students work be praised no matter how bad it is? This sounds like a good idea in theory, but when you think of it only in the educational field is really a terrible thing to do. As people; We all want to be praised for how we work and we can only get better if we practice something over and over and over again and can get even more if we`re happy with what we`re practicing and happiness comes with every praise. But if all we got while learning was praise but nothing to improve on then what would be the point to continue learning if all we get is a ""this is amazing"" or an A+ on every assignment they got. They would improve but students also develop zero tolerance to any criticism and probably going to want all the attention focused at them.

A great example to this would be any artist; artists are based all around the idea of everything they make are things that they'll hate even if theres true improvement. they get praised but thats not what drives them to do better its the hatred of what they do that gives the motivation to improve and even take criticism with a grain of salt but use it to get better. Using what we learned from any artist it`d be a terrible thing to do, as the purpose of a student is to learn and use what they learned in the world and in the world theres going to be people who criticize what they do and if they cant take that criticism they`re most likely gonna get fired.

In conclusion. I`m not saying that praising to much is a bad thing and i`m also not saying you should make the student hate what they`re doing. But i am saying that with every praise should be a criticism just to balance it out and show the students that with every positive comes a negative and that the worlds not just going to be all praise to a person.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5

Working in Groups or Alone

In school sometimes we work in groups and sometimes we work alone. Working alone is fine because we don't get headaches from classmates; however, working in in groups is better because we get extra help from classmates. Working in groups is better because we get extra help from classmates, we get more opinions, and it takes less time doing the assignment.

First, working in groups is better because we get extra help from classmates. For example, we divide the assignment with our classmates. Each person has their own part to do and we finish it faster than do it alone. Working in groups is better because we will have more contribution from classamtes.

Second, working in groups is better because we get more opinions. For example, every person in the group give opinions. We get more ideas if we are more than only one person. We don't have to think everything about the assignment because we will have thinking help. Working in groups is better because we get more ideas.

Finally, working in group is better because the assignment will take less time to be completed. It will take less time because we will get more support and all the work don't will be completed just by one person. There will be more help and each person will do a little work what means that we will finish faster because it will take us less time doing the assignment than do it alone. Working in groups is better because the assignment will take less time to be completed.

In conclusion, working in groups is better because we divide the work with our classmates, we don't have to think everything about the assignment because we will have thinking help, and the assignment will take less time to be completed. Working in groups is a gift. ",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0
6B3B3CB54EB9,"My opinion about conserve energy and resources.

I have two points of view, the bad and the good one. I think this is a good idea but, it has bad things.

I think if we want to conserve energy and resources we just need to have four-day school week. Four-day school week can be benefits for the people that have to work everyday, but it has a disadvantage and is that we are not going to learn to much like a five-day school week.

My first point of view is that this can be good for many students. If my school follow this system can work for many students that have to work every day. First reason is that they can have one school-day off so they can go calm to the job. They can have that day off in school and job. Second reason is that, this can be good also for those students that skip school everyday, maybe if they know that we just got four-day school week they would want to come to school. Third reason is that teachers can have more time to work on projects and do all that work that they have to do.

Second point of view is that is system can not be a good idea. First reason is that students would not learn as much as five-day school week. Second reason is that is going to be tired to be ten hours of school. Third reason is that two more hours of school are not a good idea for those that have a part-time, they would not be on time in their jobs. Two more hours of school can be frustrate for many students.

My position on this issue is that this would not work. First reason is that many students that have to work they would like to go to school beacuse of two more hours. students that have to work start they shift at 5 pm and school would end at 6:04 pm, students would skip the last classes. I think if this is to conserve energy and resources it would not work beacuse is like they are adding part of the last day of school to each day so like the same think.

My conclusion is that is not a good idea my school sould not approve this issue. This like the same think as five-day school week. If they don't add two more hours this maybe can work, but I think this going to be hard for students and teachers. With this system we are not going to conserve energy and resources is going to be the same thing. ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5

This is my opinion of your future change in the school activities. I'm not in favor in this change, if the students are good players, the principal have to let they play at least they have a grade C average, but if the students don't have a good grade, like F or D, the principal have to tell they that they can't play anymore, till they make a good grade.

This change can do a good change because the students that play a sport or if they are in the band, and if they care more in the activity that they play, maybe that can be distorting the student, that can be the reason of why they don't have good grades, so the students what the students have to study at the same with their sport or other activity, and be good with both. Maybe the students are better in their activity because sometimes we have more fun, and because we like to be in more movement.

6CD851AF4D16,"I think we accomplish if we are always doing something, because it will help you to learn more things, we have to always stay busy doing something if we want to achieve. Doing anything will not help you if you want to be someone in the life. One reason to stay busy doing something is that will help you to develop new things, and focus doing things that you like to do, and see your potential and be able to do anything you have in mind.

Another reason is that doing something will help you to open your brain, and think positive, also have big ideas that will be very helpful for your life, if we want to be a successful person, never have to be idle. For example if you want to be a professional soccer player you have to train and work very hard everyday on it to get it, practice skills, develop your abilities. If you just watch videos on YouTube and don't do anything, that will not help you to get it, you have to put on practice to get it.

Another example is if you will have a test and you want to get an A, you have to studies your notes and not be lazy, if you just go to take the test without know anything, you will fail the test, you have to be a positive person, feel comfortable, and believe in yourself.

In conclusion if we want to be a successful person, we never have to be idle, and we have to always stay busy doing something, always be positive, see the potential you have and feel able to do everything you want, and never be inactive, you have to be an active person to reach your goals.

6D104CA14B33,"75% of the time students graduate early to go to college. Matter of fact I believe that students should graduate in three years and work, because they would save money for college, they will be mature for college, and they would have time management skills. This will help students gain lots of opportunities before college.

First, students would have the opportunity to save money for college. Some students like to get a loan for college, because they don't have enough money, and parent's can't support him/her. But if students get a loan for college, then they would have to pay it back after college. If students get out of school in three years, then they have the chance to work and save money for college. Students won't need a loan if they work, and the parents would not have to worry about the money. This is good, because students would have to rely on themselves, and have responsibilities. This will show others that you matured, and will make your parents proud.

Secondly, students who work will be more mature, because they would have to rely on themselves, have lots of responsibilities, and they would understand the outside world better. Some students who graduate early tend to be 17 years old. If they do the one year work force, then they would gain money and become more mature. Maturity matters, because students need to understand how to turn in work to their professor on time. Being mature will make you an adult, and make others take you serious, not a joke. Some students get bullied, because they are younger than everyone else, and we do want that happening to anyone. But if you do work that one year you graduate early, then you will get into college the same year your friends are, and you won't have to worry about being alone.

Lastly, Some students don't turn in school work on time. Work could gain the student time-management skills, because they would have to be at work on time, do what they have asked to do on time, and never be late. Time management skills will help you in school by, turning things on time, not being late to class, and sleeping early for the class you have the other day. Time management skills isn't only for being late and turning work in on time, time management is also important for setting a time to sleep and to wake up. It also helps you by having a time for each thing you do, like studying, working, playing, relaxing, and sleeping. If you have all of that set, then you don't have to worry about being late or not turning anything on time, because they would already have the time management skills and you would be used to it already.

I believe that others might disagree with me and say that students should go to college right away, but with all do respect I believe that students would gain a lot of opportunities if they work before going to college, because if you go to college and you aren't mature enough, then you will struggle.

In conclusion, I believe that students who work before going to college, will gain a lot in life and they will be ready for college. Because they wouldn't have to worry about paying the loan off after college, they would have a better time management skills than others will, and they will become more mature by being responsible and handling it themselves.

6D9728CB8711,"School should add one and a half hour to school each day. because student will get to learn more,student can get more help from teachers,also student can do more sports.

First of all,student will learn more if school board add one and a half hour to their school day. probably student will learn more because their classes will be extended. Also they can get more time in each class,so they can get more information and learn more about each subject. Also they will have the opportunity to do more activity in class. And learn how to work with others. And listen to different opinions and get to a conclusion,For example if some student are good in a activity and others are not that good. They can have the time to work as a group and explained what they are good at and what they need more help, so they all can help each other. They will also have time to work by them self. And passing there SOL.

Secondly, student can get more help from teachers. It will benefit all the student in the school, because some student need more help and different subjects. So they can have the time to go to their teachers and get some help. for example some student needs help in Math,English,civic etc. But some student are better in that subjects. So they can used one and a half hour to do another period. In that period student can go to the classes that they need more help. It will be better for some student because each student are different. And learn in a different ways . It does not mean that others are smart. It means that some student learn better in small groups. Some student learn more faster than others. Extending school it will help them get their grades up,By retaking quizzes and test and finish unfinished work. they can get help in homework too because homework is like practice,they can practice what they learn in class and get a better score in quizzes and tests

Finally,student can have the time to do more sports. With some of their schoolmates. They can have different sports. For example soccer,basketball,baseball,kickball and more sports..Student can make a vote, for what sports they will like to be in. They can learn new skills and get better by playing that sport. and get more healthy because they are playing a sport. because a big percent of student used a lot of their technology at home and don't do any sports. By extending school it can motive them,by doing some sports with their friends. They can play a lot of sports and see which sport they prefer to play,and see in which sport they are good at. They can do more activity for example Art, photographing for people that like to be creative.

In conclusion extending school it will benefit student in different ways. for example getting help from their teacher so they can get better in that subject and get good grades,Getting more time in class,They can get more information. Finally playing sports,they can be healthy and have a hobby that they like to do after all the information that they had learn during the day,some people like to do different activity like Art photographing.

I personally know that making your own decisions is better then other people making your decisions because if a expert or other person did, they could probably decide something you dont want and then regret it later in life.

One reason why i know making your own decisions is better then seeking guidance from experts is becuase when making your own desisions you know what your doing but you have to think twice about it and then go with it. Like for example, if i chose to take geosystems instead of physics i think about it twice because i know what could be the bad thing and the good thing about that class and then go for what i think is better.

Second reason why i know making your own decisions is better because when a person makes a decision they made, then later regrets what they chose, they made a mistake. Thats a good thing because learning from your mistake's helps you a lot and benefits the wrong and making mistake's will make you a more successful person. For example, if i were to take an exam then get the results that i failed because i got a really bad grade i would try again but wouldnt give up which makes me successful.

Final reason why i know making your own decisions is better because who else in this world can? Its your life and theres never gonna be a person right by you telling you what do and what not to, so they have to learn by their selfs becuase no one is. For example, what if i said i wanted to go buy a house, who should i ask to make my decision? no one because you make your own decisions in this life.

71129FE0D18F,"Some schools districts allow students to graduate within three years. This is a good idea because of legal statuses, not having financial support, and also some students having almost all required credits.

One reason is my friend Generic_Name. My friend Generic_Name lives in Texas he is going to graduate with the class of 2020. Due to his mom's immigration statutes they left Virginia to go to Texas in the summer of 2019 to seek for help. In fear that his mother would be deported in less than a year he decided he would finish a year earlier than what was expected. This year Generic_Name is taking high level class while still being ahead of the game.

Another reason is some students have no financial support. Some students want to go into the work force but do not want to effect their academics. Graduating early would be a great solution for them. Even some want to join the work force to earn money for college or help their families financial problems.

Lastly some students have almost all credits to graduate due to taking high school classes at an earlier level. For a standard diploma in the state of Virginia you need 3 math, 3 science,4 history, 4 English, health grade 9 and 10, 2 sequential fine art, and a language. Due to some students taking some classes at earlier levels it dulls it all down for them in high school.

71F27422C5FC,"My friend, Generic_Name, is a very good student, he will not go to bed unless he finishes his homework. However, because the school has changed the system from five-day school week to four-day school week, he had to do more works than usual. He cannot sleep for a few days, he did not done all his works, and his grades tend to be bad. His parent decided to move him to another school. Changing from five-day school week to four-day school week has lots of disadvantages, mainly these three reasons: students do not have time to do more works, students move to other school due to the pressure of homework at school tend to rises, and students do not focus on learning because of three-day weekend.

To start with, students do not have time to do more works. let say that if we have an extra day to review all works that we done to prepare for the test on the next day, it would done well than when we just have more few minutes. For example: before the school change the schedule, I have a whole day to review my works to do the test, now I have to rush off my feet to review my works and that make me completely exhausted. Whenever the test would start on Monday, the students will have three-day weekend to do so, that is a completely waste of time.

To continue, students move to other school due to the pressure of homework at school tend to rises. For example: My friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, they are good students, but because their homework is too much, they could not done all homework, they had to stop all the club activities to catch up their classes, their grades went bad, so their parents decided to move them to other school to help them study easier.

Some people believe that the school has four-day school week is better because they can have more time to learn and relax, they are wrong because having four-day school week make their time rush and their have to run to catch up the schedule.

And the last, students do not focus on learning because of three-day weekend. For example: Generic_Name, a student from my class, he usually absents from school, since the school change the schedule, he started to go to school more often, but he did not study, he went around and talked what he did in the last three-day weekend, his grade was bad, but he did not care.

In conclusion, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week to conserve energy and resources, but the school does not have to because school is where people come and learn new world, to explore more what are we capable and able to do, we are not wasting the resources, so why we have to adopt four-day school week?

In my opinion, I agree with this quote because, if you do not try to do better everyday, you are not going to reach your purpose. When you have the experience, on doing something you have to keep doing it, and you will improve each day. If you keep working on something that you have already work on it, and you don't stop focused on, it will make you grow. The more things you learn the more prepared you will be in your life.

My first reason that support my response, is that if you don't keep trying to do better everyday, you are not going to complete your goal. If you keep trying your best and doing what you like to do you will grow each day. Its important that you try your best everyday not only you will grow in your life but you are going to make yourself proud as well. For example, some people have their goals but they don't try their best.

My second reason that support my response is that when you have the experience on doing something you most keep doing it, and you will improve each day. Every time you try to improve, its a good opportunity for you to grow. The experience you have will make your future better. If you work on something that you have already work on it, and you don't stop focused on it will make your life easier. The more you work on something the fastest you will see the different in your life. For example, in my experience every time I know how to do something and I keep practicing, on it I get to improve myself.

My third reason that support my response is that the more things you learn the more prepared your will be in your life. If you try to learn more things and not just stay focused in just one thing will make you to be able to grow. Everyday you most have the purpose of learning new things. Learning new things each day, makes a person specialized and all the things you know. For example, in my experience when I try to learn more about something, its easier for me to talk about it.

To conclude, I agree with the author Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement. The more you know about something, the best future you will have. If you focused on doing good everyday you will grow.

72765D1D4721,"Should we as students learn from home or school ?. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I strongly disagree with this because some students would not attend the classes from home, some students can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home, and the final reason is that this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students drop out of school.

Many people believe that learning at home by a way of online or video conferencing is a great idea to attend classes from home. In my opinion, It's a bad idea because some students would not attend their classes from home. For example, students can wake up late for these online classes and forget about them throughout the whole day. In another case students won't do anything at home because they are at home relax and doing nothing but, just watching tv and playing video games. What if a student gets sick at home ? they won't do the work that is due while they are at home, some while take like the whole week off and not do anything at all. That's my first reason why we shouldn't attend school from home.

My second reason why students shouldn't attend classes from home is because some studennts can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home. For example, students can search up the answers on online or use textbooks to help them out at home. I say this because they will use the internet or a textbook because they know that there's no teacher watching them cheat on the test or quiz while they are at home taking it. Students always find a way to cheat and plus if they take a test or a quiz at home, they are for sure going to cheat on it because they know that there isn't any teachers telling them to put their phones away or notes. That's my second reason why we shouldn't attend school from home.

My final reason why students shuldn't attend classes from home is because this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students to drop out of school. For example, what if students don't attend their classes at home and also what if the ones that actually do their work do bad on it ?. Teachers can be balme for this because the way they teach it throughout online or video conferencing. This puts teachers in a bad situtation because that means they are not doing well while they are teaching online or video conferencing. Another example is, some students can just drop out of school while they do this at home. For example, if they don't do any work at home they might just drop out of school without telling anyone. Students can give up easily and just contiune their life without any education. That's my final reason why students shouldn't attend classes from home.

Healthier food would make our health be healthier, Instead of eating chunk food we should eat healthier school lunch ,because If we eat healthier food it will be easier for us to do any sport because when we eat chunk food our stomach feels heavier than when we eat healthier food, professional athletes they maintain their shape because they always eat healthier food.

It will makes us not fell into depression, When we eat chunk food and we don't eat any healthier food it makes us get fat and when we can't stop eating it makes us go to the level that we get obese and when we get obese a lot of students fells into depression because they don't like that way they look after they weight increase.

738112C600B8,"Do you think first impressions are impossible to change ? In my opinion a first impression on someone or something change be changed, because you never know what the stereotype of the thing can be.

When you first meet someone your first impression on the person can be one thing but you never know what the person could have. For example you see a fat guy or female and you can be quick to judge them but you don't know anything about there life, till when you talk to them and get to know their true story that they medical conditions on why they are the way the appear and look like. You could meet a Hispanic, For example you might thing they came to US illegally, but you don't really know that some Hispanic are actually born in the united states and are legal citizens. when you see a Asian person you may think there smart because of your first impression stereotype, but not all Asian are actually smart and appear to who you really think they are.

Next is the type of thing you purchase or are going to purchase, it can look nice and be expensive but you dont know the background story on the item or thing you are going to purchase. For example when you want to purchase a car or house, you can be looking at it on the internet and like it a lot but once you buy it you start noticing strange thing. If it is the car you realize the its starting to give you a lot of problems that you are constantly taking money out you'r pocket to try to fix it to your expectations and what were your first impression on the car being nice and reliable. Second a house you're impression where ""oh wow this is a really nice house"", so you go on and purchase it the you start realizing that the house was making wired noises at night while you are trying to sleep, Then one day you go online and contact the landowner or research the history of the house and realize the house is haunted because the original owner past away their.

A first impression is just a stereotype or judgment that you think of someone or something before not know the background story on it. Before you go and be quick to judge some based on their looks talk to the person see why they are really the way they look before making fun of them of talk about them because everyone in this world isnt perfect and everything has a story behind it.

Why? because in many occasions they do not have another choose. In this decade teenagers have the right to choose the career that they want to study. In High School students are preparing and learning different elements and different skills, however; learning others skills benefit teenagers in their future. How? and Why? because learning different skills prepared teenagers for any jobs or if they have any kind of problem anywhere. Guiding students for what they like since a young age is an acceptable idea because they learn more and more each day. Their mentality is improving each day. For example: They try to look for information, asking people that already have experiences with the career that they are thinking to take. After Middle School and High School students are ready to start college and they should be assuming what is best for them.

In some parts of the world teenagers do not have the opportunity to go to school, countries that do not have good recursive, for example: Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Africa. In those kind of countries many teenagers do not go to school because they prefer to work beside of going to school, their education is not good enough. That is why so many people come to U.S. because they know that the education that U.S brings them is their future. Each Teenager comes with a dream to U.S. Kids at age of 12 of those countries comes with big mentalities with big dreams, that is what helps many teenagers to choose a good career in U.S, at young age they know that they have to make their family proud and be the alpha of the family with a good career. Also as the population in those countries is increasing day by day is harder to find a job even if you had a good diploma it do not matters. The society in those countries when kids want to go to school their parents don't let them, ""the education here is not going to guide you anywhere"" that is what they said, that is why now days are many terrorism in many countries because parents takes the dreams of their children and through them to the trash. Many parents should give teenagers the opportunity of studying and talk them about how important is to have a good education and let them think about the career that they want at young age.

The importance of knowing and thinking about the future at young age has been an impact in now days, because in many cases around the world teenagers do not think about their future, they do not care about school, jobs, education, or their family, but in U.S teenagers have many chances of getting a good job and getting a good healthy life and a great education.

Teenagers will have their life set after High School.

Teenagers are going to be an inspiration for others.

They will have a good job.

Ensuring that students should have their career in mind by the time that they enter to High School for them to learn more and preparing when they get to college and learn much more and be an inspiration for many other teenagers and for others to think of the importance of having a good education and career.

7445CD7E0985,"According to the text I think is a good idea that students can graduate from high school in three years because if you graduate from high school very early you are going to get a lot of opportunities to be successful in life, I also think that if someone decide to start working contraction or hard works like that early, three years later that person going to get a lot of experience and money and if you decide go to college or some like that when you graduate from college you going to be young and ready for life, that's how a lot of people became millinery, because the must time you spend doing something that's more experience that you going to get, and when you got experience and you know what you doing, and what you want you life going to be better and easier in the future.

People also think that it is a bad idea graduate from high school in three years because they said that is to early, and you don't going to be smart enough to be successful in life but I said "" that's wrong because we still have to go to summer school and take extra classes in summer school and you have to be very smart because you need to pass all you classes you cannot fail any class because if you fail one you need to take it in summer school again and that's going to be a problem so if you want to graduate early you also have to take classes online so you're going to be very busy so they should be ready for the next level.

I know someone that he is from Dominican Republic but he leaves in Generic_City, I went to one of his barbershop and i ask him

"" what did you do to be so successful? he told me this "" when i was 16 years old I graduate from high school' then i ask ""how you graduate so early and he told me that he take classes in summer school and he take classes online"" i said that' s good ""keep telling me how you became succesfull "" and he told me that after he graduate he went to college to take classes the barbershop 3 years later he was only 19 years old so he have to work for one year if he want to open his own busyness then after that he open three barbershops in Generic_City he said if you put you best effort to the thing you, and life going to get better everything.

Another thing is that not everybody make it,

is hard but i have i tip for those type of people never give up just do you best and put you hurt to it and put you best effort because at the and your mom and dad don't going to be there to pay for you food you going to be the man in that house so that's why everybody need to work hard everyday if they one to be successful in life.

In conclusion the best thing for student in graduate early because the must experience you get doing something the must money you going make and for me life is about perseverance, progress, and be successful because if you don' got nothing nobody going to respect you, and you need to help the people that cannot make it because people fail sometime life is not that easy for some people is you got the opportunity to do it good in life take that opportunity.

When you draw you can do make whatever you want and if you made a mistake you can fix it ,my other favorite type of drawing is the one where you paint, because you can paint what are you feeling like if you're sad,happy,angry,upset. Art is one of my favorite talents i can make whatever i want and peolpe pay a lot of money for the drawings or paints they don't care if they cost billions of dollars they pay it, because it's beautiful art. Art is a talent that a lot people have it, some people are so good at it, that sometimes they think it's not good enought so they decide to throught it away, but they don't know that some peolpe will like it and they will pay it for their art.

74E468FCE398,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Based on my experiences, I disagree with this statement, first impressions are made by everyone but it is not impossible to change. Your first thoughts of someone. Everyone makes first impressions of people before even getting to know them by the way they dress, and looks. Some first impressions can be changed and some can't be.

First impressions is a human thing, I believe that everyone has at least made a first impression of someone and their first impressions can be impossible for them to change or it can be changed. The way someone's appearances can be affected by first impressions by so many ways. That is a major cause that is first seen. The way you are approached.

My Experiences can be said some of my first impressions can be hard to change, or I can be wrong about someone and my first impressions can be way off,and that person turns out to be nothing like what I have thought. This statement can be argued from two sides. Sometimes it can be impossible to change what your first thoughts can but than other times it can be changed.

One major first thoughts of a person can be the way a other person dresses, the way they look they way the walk, the way they talk. There are so many things a person can have first thoughts about a human being and just assume things about before even getting to meet . There is a lot of people in this world whos first impressions are impossible for them to change and would never change. But than theirs many other people whos first impressions are changed.

In conclusion, I believe that first impressions can be changed by my perspective, It is hard for someone to change the way they think of someone, but thats why its called ''first thoughts'' because it can be changed over time the way you look at someone can start to be seen differently and your thoughts will change.

750184492A96,"Do you want to be board going extra hours to school, when you could be doing fun things? All the sports that you want to do will be ruined if you do homework club. Students should not have after school homework club because you won't have time to spent with family members, students are not going to have time to play there favorite sports, and they won't be able to play their favorite sport.

First of all, students won't spend time with their family. If youre in after school club and your parents are planning to go eat dinner, you are not going to make it. For example, Generic_Name is at school and the day is over but, he needs to go to after school club. Generic_Name call his mother and told her "" Mom i need to stay after school today"" but, his mother told him ""we were going to your favorite restaurant Red Lobster."" Generic_Name upset that we wont be able to go to his favorite restaurant because of after school club. This proves that after school can affect on family time. Generic_Name missed his favorite restaurant

just because school.

Secondly, students won't be able to play sports. If you are in after school club and in a sport your most likely going to be late for your favorite sport. For example, Generic_Name

plays Basketball but he goes to an after school club for English class. On Wednesday Generic_Name needs to go to the after school club, also he has Basketball practice after the club. Generic_Name goes to practice and he is five minutes late the coach tells him that is strike one. PROPER_NAME tried to convince the coach that he was at a club for school, the coach told Generic_Name """"Is either school or Basketball Generic_Name."" Generic_Name got kicked form the team because he got to strike three. This proves that after school club can affect the sport that you play. Generic_Name got kicked from the sport that he loved, and the sport that he though that was going to be his career.

Finally, if you like video games their is only video games

on the weekend if take this club. You are going to come late from school which means that you are not going to be able to play. For example, Generic_Name is a gamer on YouTube he streams every day and plays games for YouTube, but now that he has to go to after school club he can't stream on week days because he gets out of school at 6:30 and the drive home is 30 minutes. So, Generic_Name gets home at 7:00 and he needs to do some of the home work that he didn't got to do on the club and is to late for him. Also, Generic_Name just bought a game and he can only play on the weekends. He lost lots of people that were following him on YouTube just because homework club. Generic_Name was playing for YouTube and had

a lot of people on his stream and lost half of them because after school club.

After school homework club is a waste of time, if you have things to do after school. It's difficult to do two things at once so don't do after school club. If you like doing sports do it because you should do homework at your own time. If you do after school homework club in school for more hours. Don't do after school homework club if you don't want extra time in school.                            ",3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.5
75DAA54880C1,"The author Ralph Emerson wrote, '' To be yourself in a world that is constlantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.'' I totally agree with Emerson's statement because be something else is not the most greatest accomplishment that you can do, the most important accomplishment that you can do in this big worl is always be yourself, be humble about everything, be kind with others, and never change the person that you really are.

First, bring humble is one of the most important thing that we always need to have no matter what. Being humble can take you to the top, to be successful in the life. For example, Marisela de Montecristo, is a salvadorian beauty queen, who wob the title of Miss Universe last year and Nuestra Belleza Latina in 2013. Marisela grow up very poor, but when she was 10 years old, she emigrated with her mom to this country looking for a better life, however, when she came here she went to the school, she learned English, and she did graduated in social communication. In 2013 she decided to compete in a reality show that is called '' Nuestra Belleza Latina '' and she won, and with all the money that she won, she decided to founded an own restaurant for her mom in Las Vegas, Nevada. Six years latter, she decided to compite for Miss Universe El Salvador 2018, where she resulted the winner. That year she went to Thailand to compite for the title of Miss Universe. Now she is a famous person and she have her own foundation that helps people in countries around the world like Africa, El Salvador, Mexico, Philipines. Also she is modeling in differents countries like Paris, Spain, and Great Britain, but above all this things that shes is doing, she always still humble. In one interview with Telemundo, she said that being humble is the key of being successful in the live, and I totally agree with her.

Second, be kind with others is something that defined you as a good person, because people love when someone is really interesting in help others. For example, I think that we should be kind with others, help others, because we never know when we going to need help of these people, in addition, being kind is other accomplishment that you can do in this life, and is something that you can feel proud of be.

Third, never change who you really are for something passenger or for something that can not give you happiness, because be yourself is the most important thing that you can do in this big world. For example, my mom told me that being myself is the only thing that can make the difference of me between everyone, she also told me that being gay is not a hindrance to triumphing in my life, because with effort, dedication, and persistence I can do many things in my life, without necessity of change the person who I am.

To finish, be yourself is the only and the best thing you can do in your life. There is not other way to be happy and to demostrated to the world that you don't have to be something else to be successful and to make greatest accomplishment in your life, because the key always is going to be be yourself and be proud the person who you are.",3.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0
760988C4BA3B,"In the future, I hope that one day I will win a ""Super Smash Brothers"" tournament. Growing up, Smash Bros has always been one of my favorite games as a child and it had helped bring my siblings and I closer together. I can get paid for winning a tournament, and it will help me get through in life. I know that I can't just win a tournament right off the bat but I want to try, because the thrill of just winning and having fun is what makes people enjoy this game. Winning a ""Super Smash Brothers"" tournament is something that I can enjoy while helping me in life.

""Super Smash Brothers"" had helped me bond closer with my siblings throughout my life. Even if we've gotten tired of doing other activities together, we've never got tired of fighting each other in the game. Fighting with my siblings had molded me into the competitive person I am today, so because of that I want to fight other people and get something out of it. It helped me learn to be competitive because it's a competition in the real world. Smash Bros helped me discover other games to enjoy with others like Kirby franchise and the ""Legend of Zelda"" franchise. Beating other players with characters I love makes me want to play more with new people. I never really had the best communication skills, but I can enjoy playing different video games and competing in tournaments with others while improving my social skills.

Winning a tournament can help me get money, so I can buy my necessities in life. Getting the money could help me buy luxuries like a house or a car. If I can win a tournament and get the money, I could have those things and even get more that I need. If I can buy those then I won't have to have help from my family. I could get other games that I enjoy watching other players play. Just by watching people play these games makes me want to compete with them. I always loved competing with others and now I could even get paid to do so if I win a tournament.

""Super Smash Bros"" just gives me the thrill of competing with others and having fun while doing so. People always get this thrill of winning and it keeps them going to win more. Every time I beat my brother in a game I get excited each time, and I want to beat new people just to get that thrill. If you don't get that thrill of wanting to do more of what you are doing then you wouldn't do that thing again for a while. Like other games, Smash Bros bring players together by competing with each other and just having fun. I want to experience that with other people in tournaments. Winning a tournament or just competing in one will help me learn that doing activities are not always as fun as doing them with others.

My life will be brighter when I accomplish something big like winning a Smash Bros tournament. I've always enjoyed the fun in playing games with others and talking to them about it. It also sounds great when you get paid to do something you love like competing in tournaments. I learned that doing activities are never as fun when you're doing it alone.

This type of projects give you a lot of knowledge, and this projects give you an idea on how nature works is easy to do and is fun. Also getting help form your friends is better everyone gets to give ideas and help with the fun project. A science project is also fun because you get to work with chemicals and see the reaction of each chemical. This is one of the most enjoyable educational things to do.

Doing a science project gives knowledge specially if is about nature. If the project is about nature the things you'r gonna learn are fun and easy for example what causes wind,solar system,and how does the moon help us this projects are gonna make you learn about how earth works. Learning is boring but the science projects make learning more fun and it gives ideas for future projects. Also working as a team with you'r friends is helpful because you get to hear different parts,and it would help you learn more about the project you are doing.

Working as a team to see the different points of view of everyone is fun,and it helps for the project. This is fun because you get to help friends out, and do experiments with chemicals. Presenting the the project would make you nervous if your by your self if you did it in a group its gonna be fun and also more easy. Working on a project with friends is always gonna be fun specially on a science one because you have to repeat the project three times to make sure it gives the same result every time and its super educational to do.

The chemicals you use during a project could be dangers but at the same time they could be fun to use. This is an educational fun project because you get to see how the reaction of different chemicals. The most fun part of a project is that you get to repeat things more then once in order to get the correct results is the most fun thing during a project testing out stuff. This is one of the most enjoyable educational stuff you can do and its fun.

This is an enjoyable thing to do you have so much fun doing a project,and Helping out friends by giving them ideas for the project working as a team to make it perfect and learning. For me this is the most fun thing to do when i have a project, and theres so many more activities but a science project is enjoyable to do and is also the most fun thing to do.

7999A063F80E,"I agree that praising a students work is an outstanding idea to jump start a students path to success,but praise is not the way to increase their self-esteem. By overpraising a student his or her confidence has to be on a different level. Students will also have a harder time dealing with constructive criticism. However, if a student works really hard to achieve something,then that feeling of completion can motivate them to continue to their path of success. Getting your business done without any praising and knowing you put your all into it could make you feel way better about yourself and it would just not motivate you but the people around you. I say this because people don't usually thank you or give you any comments they usually mean. You would never know what could come out someone's mouth.

They wouldn't want to agree with this but, that's because we all think different and most of us know the real meaning behind something similar to this. If you achieve something and you keep on achieving things in life you will get many blessings. People don't usually know the difference between praising and achieving your goal without it. You don't need people telling you about your work or whatever you are doing because at the end of the day you're the only one who knows what you're accomplishing in life. Teachers should let students achieve their goals and not worry about what the other person has to do or say. By accomplishing something could make you learn new things in life too. People get confused and don't get the message, we need more people to believe in their selves and not about what other people have to say.

Although I think it's nice of people complimenting and saying positive things about your work but, I still have to go with achieving it on your own. So what if they dislike your achievements? so what if they start doubting? prove them wrong with all your accomplishments that are coming your way. Make them regret what they said and go accomplish more.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5
79F917A8CFEC,"People are capable of making their own decisions. Guidance is helpful if there are no choices that the person sees that needs it. With guidance it can be helpful, it can also be misleading and people aren't completely following their instincts. Self-reliance allows one to follow their own path and makes their own decisions. These types of situations is what most people struggle with, but this helps people benefit from themselves.

We all value self-reliance to the fact that if someone makes their own decisions they have to solve the problem. In our minds we think about different things in a situation, the good and the bad. Although guidance makes you sound weak, but we want to be satisfied with our decisions. People who are self-reliance are capable of doing the same tasks they are in. In nature, most animals get to be self-reliance in order to stay alive, for example, as bear gets older, their parents have to let them go alone in the wild.

We have voices in our minds that we talk to, and get really indecisive. Like when we shop, you choose between two or more pieces of clothing. An over-sized black hoodie and a regular sized white hoodie. The prices are in the same range, a worker comes up to you asks if you need assistance. Then you feel like you're being held back by people who offer advice.

When I read my prompt for this essay, I struggled coming up with ideas and examples. The thought of, what am I going to do, to make my essay satisfied so I can succeed? You feel like you need to find information yourself, managing your stress and time. The process of thinking about your ideas.

Our stance on the matter of self-reliance in humans stans to show people need to be self reliant because it is good to not distinctly require independence on any other. Others can conduse issues more than solve them, at times. With self-reliance, one is more keen on their own inabillities and strives to problem solve with a more in-depth and notable understanding.",4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5

To work on groups is better for many reasons,everybody can help each others,in groups student's can do a better work,and it can help all the people on the group to learn more skills,it can help students to know each others and be friends, more communications, more ideas and sometimes it can be helpful to work in groups because some students don't know what to do,i thing teachers should let student's to work more on groups so like that they would help each other and work better,and is good to work with a group because that can help you for the rest of your life like on your job also with your family and you con do better and a great job if you work in group

It can be helpful for students to work in group,First, because with more people helping are more and betters ideas and more helpful for every students,and sometimes student's don't know what to do,but if somebody on the group help so he would understand and know how to do a great job and work with a group is much helpful than work alone on many ways like to understand better with communication with your group and it can be helpful so you can do a good work and pass the class and not failed,and work in group it can help you to know others people that are in the same classroom but you never have the oportunity to talk wich their so in the teacher make a group and you can joing to one there is going to be new people and you can know others people

,Second,it is good for student's to work in groups because they can learn more skills such like the communication and they can help each others with the written,and also they can help each others how the way they talk. The communication is important and many cases because with communication you can do many things, like if you don't understand something you can tell somebody for help and all the persons on the groups can practice all days to do a great work,and also some student's need a lot of help so students that know more can join to the groups to help the others,but sometimes is not because some students don't know how to do the work sometimes it because they don't understand sometimes is because the language is a problems for some student's so there is good to make groups to help them,Third it can be an experience to work in groups because some students that don't know each others later on they can be friends and work in groups it can be helpful to students,but also to school because work on groups students can understand more and they can get betters grades also work in groups and a a good relationship it can be helpful not only at the school it can be helpful like in your home with the family and not to get in trouble with their, but also it can help you on your job to work well and not to have problems with the people that you work with,is like on soccer that why it call a soccer team because they help each others they share new or more strategies that it can help others to do a great job because work in groups students have more and betters benefits to do a great job,Finally is good to have a good communication in groups because with a great communication all the the group can understand each others and is important to have a good relationship in the group so like that they can do a better job and some students help others and that is great to be generous with others because if you help to someone that need help other people is going to help you on what you need and is a lot much better to work in group than alone sometimes when you are working alone and you got stuck in something no body is going to help you,but if you are working with more people in group they going to help you on what you need but most of the teachers want's to students work alone sometimes is good that students work alone because sometimes students got distracted for the people on the group and the teachers don't wants students to copy each others sometimes is good to work alone maybe better concentration,but sometimes is not that good to work alone because sometimes you got stuck in somethig, but if you are working with a group they are going to help you i would like to see more teachers that put more student's to work in group i don't think student's would like to work alone than with a group is better an sometimes is more easy and faster

In conclusion, is a great idea for me thats teachers make students to work in groups on my opinion is much helpful to they work in groups instead to work alone,because when people work in groups they have betters ideas and they can do a better work with more interesting and more opinions is better to do a great job and also have a great relationship and a great communication is so important to work in a group and some students know more than others so the students thats know more is good that they help the others on what they need and is good to work in group so like that you can know others people i hope teachers continuing making groups to students can learn more than what they know and work in group it can help you on your life because if you got a job and many people work there too but you don't like to work with others people as a group the boss is going to kick you out only because you don't know how to work as a group and if you only like to work alone it can be a problem if you don't understand work with others people is better always more ideas,opinions like that you can do a better work and it can help your future job and the rest of your life sometimes some student's don't like to work in group's sometimes it because they don't know others people,but i thing if teachers would like to student's work more in groups i thing they would like it and they can have more communication student's would like to work with a group, I like to work with a group because sometimes i don't know what to do so others students help me to do a great work and we all share other.",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5

First , I think its important to have a positive attitude in your everyday life because, of the stress that goes on. No one will understand how you feel other than you. If you stay in the mindset of "" i cant do this,"" ""this is too hard."" You will never see yourself prosper and grow. How can you have the biggest expectations in life when you are so dull and negative. To advance you need to be aware that everything is going to be okay, be reminded of that.

Secondly, your work place always has to stay positive. This is the place you go to work in , this is a place you try to distract yourself from the rest of the world. If you set your self to a person who feels as if they cant do anything then you will never reach that promotion youve been waiting for. If you set your self as the person who puts too much on themselves, you will never see growth. You can do the impossible it will just be up to you to change your circle.

Although, there are many people who live in doubt and build this wall of negativity in there life. You cannot be that person. Think about the little things in life , you have a roof over your head, your family is safe, you are safe. You never go a day without eating. Those are the little things that matter.

Lastly , in your "" time of need"" you should always be more optimistic. Whenever you are feeling down and feel like your world is falling apart be aware that your surroundings should never bring you negativity. There are so many other thing you could and should be thinking about, the little this matter in this life. Feelings are always temporary and you need to always make sure that the positive things impact you the most. Greater things are to come in everyone life.

In conclusion, being positive in many ways will always change your mindset . Positive attitudes are key to a better future and for the best success in your life. ",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5
7C08DA95AE9A,"One way to improve student achievement is to start a after school homework club.

Teachers and students should start meeting after school this idea would benefit students by getting extra support, turning assignments on time get a better understanding of the things that the teacher teach on class, establishing the club would help those students who don't turn in assignments on time or those who like to do things early.

In order to students to be successful they need extra support a better explanation of the things they learn, many students struggle with the assignments and most of them don't ask for support through the school year I have seen many students raping the assignments because they don't understand them, but if the school make the the idea of starting a club there would be no excuse for students to not be successful in their homework, tests, and class assignments.

Students should start turning assignments on time specially those who don't turn in on time, the club would help many students like instead of going home and forgot that they have assignments to do they could come and join the after school homework club. I have friends who like to do homework and be successful, but the problem is that they don't understand the assignments and if someone don't understand something why should they do it because either way they going to get the assignment wrong the school must provide more support for students.

In addition the club could not be just of getting help or finish assignments early, the club could be a place were students can find support and motivation in order to be a better person on life many students don't care about school because they don't find the good thing about it maybe because they need a motivation to be at school the after school club could be a place where people can meet and share ideas or meet each other and make a friendship helping each other to understand better the thing that they don't understand.

In conclusion the school must make the after school club in order to get more successful students and to also help and motivate students to do their assignments and turning them on time. extra support is a better way to understand the things you don't understand, turning assignments make a student seem responsible and also get a good admiration of others making friends and share, discuss thing together is a better way to solve a problem that they had.",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0
7C4960DF5CB8,"I think that there should be a after school homework club because its hard to understand homework sometimes and you dont know what you are doing exactly but if we were to have these clubs think about how many students would get there work done . We might think that homework isnt important but it is homework is worth 10 percent of your grade and sure that might not be a lot but it could really help your grade. And it could really help you like when it comes to test you could know the matrial you need for this test if you did that one piece of homework that one piece of homework could have helped you past that test you probly failed or quiz . Also some students dont understand the work the teachers give like when you dont understand that class work you were doing in that class how do the teachers expect that the student bring in there homework .

I hard for students to learn middle school student have a lot to do for example students have to worry about getting homework done for all 7 of these classes it isnt easy . Most teachers might give more than one piece of homework some might give 2 some might give 3

pieces of homework .

Students could also ask about what they dont understand they will help students in what they dont understand or what they didnt understand in that lesson that they had .The teacher will explain what you didnt understand , some students just dont have time so maybe that one day that can stay afterschool could help them get all that students homework done . Also help them undestand not just give that student the answer to the question they would actually learn and that . This also will get students grades up and might take a B to and A

. It will not only help the students but the school to because if these student are getting there homework done then that will make the school look better . Teacher will also know that students are getting there work done and not just getting the anwser like some students do now when it comes to homework . Other students that are cabelble of doing this work on there own but have a hard time turning the homework in on time and if the school had a afterschool club this it homework wouldnt be a problem .

In conclusion this club would be really good to have because homework is a big issue in alot of these schools and most students dont care or dont understand how much homework matters it matters so much you probly wonder. Why you didnt pass this test or why couldnt pass this quiz you took maybe if you did that homework you could have past the test , quiz also home plays a big role in school teachers give studnets homework so we can get better at that subject it easier for students not to care about homework ''BECAUSE IT DOESNT MATTER'' but it does and. No matter how many time you try to tell yourself it doesnt matter it does and that is not going to change so do your homework and if this afterschool club happend then homework will be one less thing to worry about . I think that if the school had this club it would really help studnets in school and help really understand the work and homework and help them be less stress because it it alot of work for you to get done and espcially if you dont get the work you need to do . Also students would be happy that they got there homework done now they can do whatever they want afterschool becaus ewhat was taking up most of there afternoon is now done .",2.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,2.5
7CBB1B6F4E25,"Having electives classes can be a great opportunity to let students choose what they love to do and be lesss stressful. Schools, which do not have electives classes had become less popular. Students choose to study in schools that are less complicate for them. Although some say students should be required to take class in the arts actually, students classes should be electives because students can use the free time more helpful for their benifit and they will have less worries.

Those who believe students should be required to take class in the arts have their reasons. They believe students have to be more responsible and pass all their classes. They also think students can learn how to be good in arts.

One reason, why class in atrs should be electives is because students can use the free time more helpful for their benifit. For example, my friend Generic_Name he only had to take Algebra 2, English 12, U.S Goverment, and Chemistry to graduate this year. However, he had to take one class in the arts that was required to graduete. But, Generic_Name did not have more space during that day,

and the other day of school Generic_Name had to work to help his mother.

If Generic_Name did not have to take the class in arts. He will be able to graduate this year. In addition, he will not waste his time in one class that maybe will not be interesting for him. Also, he will be able to help his mother about taking care of his litter bother. When she was working, so his mother did not have to work less hours.

Another reason, why classes in school shoud be electives is because students will have less worries. For instance, my friend Generic_Name. One day she had to study for her History

ESOL. As well as, she had to make a big and beautiful draw for her class in art. Generic_Name took almost all the night making the draw ,so she did not have time to study and she fall the

ESOL. If Generic_Name did not have to make the draw for her art class. She will study for the ESOL, and she will get enough sleep. Generic_Name will be able to think and pass her test. And she will have more time to study. Sometimes taking a lot of classes is not a good idea for students bacuse it is to hard for them to concentrate.

To conclude, I believe that class in arts should be alectives becuase students will be more confident in doing what they love to do. Also respecting students opinions can be a great opportunity to demostrate them that school cares about what they feel. For those reasons I think class in arts should not be required. One is that students will use the free time more helpful for their benifit.

Another one is that students will have less worries. School have to see what their students need to make them capable and sucessful.   ",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0

Yes : I agree with Winston Churchill. I know some people say that too, to be success at first; you going failure to failure, in once you try not to failure guest what, you fail again. This can be happen , but Winston was right , to success you can fail all the time. When somebody want to be success in he/she fail, that doesn't mean they cannot "" try"" again. But the thing is, they need to get up in keep trying on till then.

If success brought people failure to failure, then what would that be in life, when you fail on try to be success, it not a bad thing cause sometime in life either you: win or you loos, but at least you can try one more time. Failure might be discourages you, but you can Always keeping going to accomplish your gold, or maybe you might "" successful"" after all.

1)Success is a good thing for those who fail in fail in the results, they successful. Winston idea was right, so my position is that success consists of going from failure to failure without loosing enthusiasm are lesson you. With enthusiasm your success going greats and fast. Thats it true enthusiasm try to find your success can make a big differences. An in endurance can bring you to successful too, in time you'd need it.

2)If you pursuit or enthusiasm your can success anything that you thing that hard can be easier's for you, cause you put your ; Enthusiasm, and convicted your issue. Failure without trying "" does not"" gave nothing excepted discourage, in that will be stupid of you if you failure in you give up in the same time.

3) Failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm will give you something in return, in that is ""fact"" no dispute about it. Even those who loves you can make fun of you, it they sees you keeping failure; or stay away from you on till you ""win"" or find what you want's.

Anabel for you to be success you need enthusiasm, it gonna give courage, and not to focusing on you failure, then you'll never success or accomplish your gold. For example : Generic_Name his a psychology teacher in Generic_School,Generic_Name never thought he will be a teacher cause his gold was to teach psychology, unfortunately he cant past his test so that he can graduated, but he thought about it , he put all his enthusiasm on it Generic_Name past the test in now his a successful guy.

TWO, take example about people who never thought they will success, such ass Generic_Name, Generic_Name,and Generic_Name Generic_Name.

TREE, always get up when fail, always focuses on you success, and take that serious when you a failure. As a Mather of fact , look at all the Hollywood stars' , some of them didn't born with success some of them were poor, having no skills ,and some of them didn't have no education. They work hard in hard to be success cause that was their gold to be "" success"" in they accomplish it even if they fail sometime.

Winston Churchill was right about that, i'm 100% agree with his statement. If you a failure in then you loss your enthusiasm you will never be "" success"" . That's a true statement for success, in

I really Agree with Churchill's statement about the important role failure plays in the pursuit of success.

If you have a gold to be success in you though you a failure , don't like that why cause with : enthusiasm, and consists you can accomplish anything, even thing that you image you'll never accomplish or be success.    ",2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0

First, experts can help people about relationships in life for example a breakup, fights, arguments, trust issues, and lack of communication.

7CDB47E88B39,"Having a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall does not sound like a good Idea to me. Since It snows a lot in the winter we would be missing more days of school If winter break was longer. The school year is 9 months, students should get a summer break that we usually get, which is 2 months. We shouldn't have a break in the fall if we just got back into school after the long summer break.

We should not have a longer winter break. Since it snows a lot in the winter, we miss a lot of school days. Students would be missing lessons, quizes, and even tests because of the snow days we get. Students need to catch up on everything and finish lessons before the school year ends. If we get a longer winter break we would be getting out of school later on which means less summer vacation.

Since the school year is 9 months, students should get a summer break that we usually get. Students deserve the 2 months of summer break because of all the hard work and studying they did in the school year. In the summer students also get the chance to visit family members, spend more time with their family, and even get ready for the next school year.

Since we just got back into school, It is not necessary to have a one week break in the fall. We just had a 2 month summer break which gave the students the opportunity to be ready for the next school year and also gave them a chance to have a vacation. Since there is also a lot of holidays in the school year, a fall break would interfere with the day we get out of school. Which means we would probably have a little longer school year.

If we did have a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall, the school year would be pretty short and the students wouldn't like the short breaks. Even though the educators would like it and thinks that it is helpful for students, it would make the students feel stressed out since the school year would probably be shorter.

Having regular summer break, regular winter break, and regular spring break, would be a better idea then having a shorter summer break, long winter break, and a break for spring and fall.",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.5,4.5

7DDFB0CA2BF8,"Author Ralph Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" He is totally wrong because to be yourself in a world and make the greatest accomplishment in your life, the wold do not have to take control over you liberty, you should take control over the world to accomplish whats you are going to be. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson did not think before writing these letter because to be yourself in a world, you should have to make your own decisions, do something that you would like to do, and being your self not letting the world to take control over your life.

First thing,

be yourself and never give the right to the world. To make that happen you should have to make your own decisions, because if you let the world to choose for you in the future you may get lost and tire about your life, because you let the world to take control over your life, and for not choosing your own decision. Being your self and not letting the world to try to make something else, is something that will bring goods in your future, because is something that you choose and you know why did you took it and why did you choose it. However, the peoples that let the wold to choose for them they will get tire about life.

The second thing for accomplishment; and not letting the world to control you,is being your self and do what you like to do, never letting the world to do whatever it wants to do with you. If you want to do the greatest accomplishment in your life you should take something that you that you like to do. because when you do something that you like to do you will never going to get tire about doing it, when you like to do something and you wanted to be the greatest accomplishment, you are not going to feel that job like a job because is something that you like to do. But to make that happen and accomplish that dream. never led the world to do what ever it wants with you.

Being your self and not letting the world to take control over your life, the best choice that you can do, because being yourself and choose your own decision will help you to know what to do,what's good , what's bad, what career to choose, and what goal to accomplish because the only person who know all about you is you. So you should not let the world to ruin their life, and take their own decisions and tell the world that you can do it in your own. Lots of people let the world to choose for them and in future they ruin their life and they don't know whats to do for not choosing the correct choice and because they let the world to choose for them.

In conclusion, never led the world to change your life . because if you led the world to choose for you you will never going to get satisfy. Always be your self because if you led the world to choose for you will have a bad and sad feature for for not choosing the right decision. Always do a things what you like to do, like sports or a profession that you would like to be, if you choose things that you like you never going to feel it like a job. sometime you let the world to choose for you, but in the future you will get bored because you did not choose what you like. If you want to make real the greatest accomplishment, never led the world to change you. ",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0
7E109A7AC169,"The first thing to consider, is that one person is not going to behave the same way as someone else, and all people are not going to act the way as they did when they were kids. Depending on the way people are raised they may change their behavior over time. If you are brave enough you can choose who you want to be, and you can guide yourself. Everyone is going trough something at this moment, and these are not always good things. People may experiment terrible incidents that are going to change their life forever.

These events are just going trough your life, and sometimes there is nothing you can do to make it different. All these things may change you character behavior. Anyone's personality is going to change if they are not aware of what they are doing, and these actions will lead you to live horrible moments. At this point you no longer have control over your actions and just doing what you want, maybe not knowing what your character has turned into.

On the other hand; will realize what is going on around their live as they grow up, and they are not afraid to know what is happening, they will use this problems to become stronger. As time passes; they will go trough different issues, experiment different changes, but they just don't pay attention to it, and do what they want. Those people usually have control over their life and decide whether they want to change or not. A lot of people around them will try to hurt make them feel different.

For some people is easy to just not care about anything and just care about themselves, it could be a good thing because not anyone is going to make you feel bad. Over time they become smarter, stronger and tougher, but they also know if they need to change something in their life. They were just raised in a different way and a different place that is why they will act different to the rest of people because they also know what is best for them, when something bad is happening they know how to handle it.

These situations may change anybodies personality and eventually they will become a complete new different person. it just depends on the actions they choose to do and the way they see the world. it could be because of tragedies, maybe many bad people around them, they could change if they wanted to. There is many possibilities and reasons for people to change and it will happen at any given point and when they realize it, they are completely different.

It just depends on the way of your thinking, only you can decide if you want to be different, some people may have a weak or strong mind. Some situations are just defined as drastic events that could happen to you and there is nothing you can do about it if you wanted to make it better, only you know if you can handle it. You can confront it or let it change you. Some people will form their own character, or because they don't know what to do anymore. As log as you are aware of what you are doing, you will know what is best for you.                                       ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
7EED34A43536,"Inside of each people always has the right and the wrong sides. That make they think if they should being themselves or not. If a person being themselves then they just want to do anything they know and do not care another person. However, they live in the modern world and have many things to worries. Although people have their own decision, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment because sometime they need to change and over time people have done the tasks they hate.

First of all, people have their own decision. So, we know that many people are accomplishment by their own decision but only for who are smart or brave challenge themselves. Some of them just live and do anything they like when they success. However, not being themselves should not change the physical world. For example, a man who has a dream that he can travel around the world. He always thinking about it but he can not. Because he know it is a modern world and has many things to do and worries. So, he put his dream on the side and focuses on the job. He hopes it will make his life better and can complete his dream later.

Also, sometime they need to change. Some people they never change their life, and they just live by the rules. Of course, they will feel boring and nonsense. They want to do with something else. For instance, a person who live with his family and he recognizes that he likes to become the doctor in the future because his family want it. Absolutely, he knows what he wants to do. But when he do this job for the long times and he feels that he does not has more interest. Everyday, he is so busy and he does not has times for his family and himself. So, he knows work to lives, not lives to work. After thinking about that, he wants to do the jobs that makes him comfortable and can enjoy the wonderful life.

In addition, over time people have done the tasks they hate. Task is the mission from the boss give them to completing. So, they force to finish it while they do not like. When they go out to work they need to follow all the rules of the life. Also, they can not do anything they like while living with their family before. For example, a trainee person who is young and do not have an experience in the job. Because he just graduation and he wants to become the employer in this company. So, he will manage by the marketing manager and he so happy about that. For the first day, the manager just wants him to do some work likes buy the coffee, copy papers... And he thinks it will better for the next day but the manager just gives him these jobs and no more. So, he hates it but he never give up because it is the rules of life. He recognizes that help him too much to create more skills and learn more experiences.

Thus, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment. So, people should not being themselves because they do not know exactly about themselves. Some people want to become another one to success. When they look at another people they can learn more lessons and experiences in life. Sometimes, they need to change to know the outside of the world have more fun than if they just stay at one place. Another lesson for that is something they hate is not mean they give up or not finish it because it is a part of testing in the life. Just do the best they can and maybe they can accomplishment if not being themselves.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0
7F21F77E9AA3,"Big Responsibility Young Age

In most common societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they ending high school but in some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter school. What is the best? We'll figure out. Is not a easy thing to do, decision the most difficult thing to do in life and even more when your young.

Trying to know what a person want at young age it must be difficult, everybody pretend that you must know what you want at young age when you always have get everything by your parents, grand parents, aunt, uncle or tutor.

You can't know what you want to do in your life even if you haven't live by your self.

I don't think it's a good idea for students to star stressing them just when they have enter to school because school can be hard some times even if it's your first year at high school even if you are smart, so I don't think that could work making a student stressing at young age. Student have to do other stuff not only thinking about careers they want to take, students have to do homework, some students have to help their parents and get a job to help them some students love to do sport. Students also need help and time to know what they want for the rest of their life. Young people have to do it carefully because their future depends on their decisions on the present.

It's hard for a students to decide what they want for they life for instance when I was at 9 grade my parents told me, if you don't know what career you want to take it's fine you have 4 years to decide. When my parents told me this I felt so peaceful and relax because I had time to see what career I

want to take and I had time to get information about careers that were interesting for me. And I could do better at school because I didn't have to keep thinking about careers that I want for my life because I could do that in my free time.

In conclusion if a student it's a really young age let them think what they want not only because it's at young age it's also because they going to pick something that it's for the rest of their life. Not easy for a young boy or girl to know what they going to decide to do for the rest of their life, specifically when they haven't discovered what life is like. The only way that you could decide what career you want being a early age it's with help of God.",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,2.5,3.5

Cafeteria needs to change to a new, healthier school lunch menu, which would eliminate some of the students favorite cafeteria foods. It's a good idea to change to a new, healthier school lunch menu because students will eat more healthy, students will not be obese, and they will be healthy instead getting sick every other day.

Majority of the people who eat healthy on daily basis are always in good health. My mom always eat healthy, and takes care of her diet, she's 60 years old, and she doesn't have any diseases or anything. She's in good health. So, she always tells me to stay determined to eat healthy, stay hydrated, and that should be the case for everyone else as well. Changing to a healthier menu is a good idea because students will eat well, and start to like the healthy food instead of the junk food. Eventually, students will start to like fruits and vegetables instead of chips and chocolates, and drink more water instead of soda, juice, and stay hydrated. They will be diligence towards their diet. Students will eat oat meal, milk, yogurt, and some fruits in the morning from the cafeteria. It would digest easily and students will not have stomachache or any other kind of pain in the morning after eating breakfast. In lunch, they will eat proteins, for example: meat, nuts, and beans, also milk, water, stay energized for the rest of the day, and not have any disease or pain.

Students will not be obese or gain a lot of weight. They will stay in shape because they will be eating healthy food from the cafeteria, and they will not have unhealthy condition of body or mind. Students will maintain their health, and stay fit by following their diet. Their body will not contain any impurities, and they will not have any diseases. Students will be able to play sports, run fast, accomplish their goals, and discover new things in life. Also, they will be more active. If you're fat then you become lazy, always not willing to work which is not good for health. You have to be productive in order to achieve your goals in life. Students will not eat junk food from the cafeteria anymore, and it would give students the opportunity to keep up with their body and be fit.

Students will be healthy instead of getting sick every other day. Eating healthy is good because you learn how to maintain your health, and it helps you to eat well. Students will the eat the food that is good for their health. Eating healthy on daily basis, and going to the gym maximum twice a week can keep them in shape, and get rid of the illness. Healthier school lunch menu would benefit a lot of students, and illustrate them ""To purify, and be bright"". My cousin Generic_Name used to eat unhealthy all the time, even from school cafeteria as well, and always used to cry about how her stomach used to hurt. After six months she gained weight, and she was crying about it that she's never going to be fit again because she gained too much weight, but my mom told her that there's always a second chance, she was eating unhealthy, and wasn't taking care of herself so that's why she gained weight. She told Generic_Name about her healthy diet and convinced her to immediately start eating healthy, stay hydrated, do not eat junk food on daily basis, and be diligence about working towards her goal to be fit. Generic_Name listened to my mom and started eating healthy, she lost weight right after 8 months, and her stomach didn't used to hurt like it used to before all the time, that's why students need to eat healthy food from the cafeteria, and take care of their diet because they spend majority of their time in school. It might not be the best food for the students but it's good for their health.

Junk food is not good for health. Cafeteria should have healthy lunch menu. So, students can have the opportunity to eat healthy and not face any dificulties related to their health. It's a very good idea to tell students to fix their diet, and start to become responsible for what is good for their health and immune system. Students will not gain a lot of weight if they stick to their diet and eat healthy from the cafeteria. Students wil not have stomachache or any other diseases. They will be able to trust the process of eating healthy, and keep up with it. Cafeteria should only have healthy food. So, people can minimize the amount of junk food they eat on daily basis.

I disagree with this statement all students need four years in high school for know what to do in the future and they do not have any problem in college

Students graduate in three years is not good because in four years you can learn more about that career you prefer to be in the future, you can take more opportunities for to be successful people think that is good because you can graduate one year early but some times is much better continues in high school for prepare yourself. in four years you take more classes and learning about it. For example student wants to graduate and wants to be a mechanic he needs to keep going in high school for four years he learn about that career he wants and another subjects.

Some people they do not like the idea for to graduate early because they do not think that is prepare for to go to college. College is a serious thing so all people need to prepare for to go there ,when you go to the college you have a idea that difficult be for you but not impossible . you need to pass all your classes in college but for that you need to study and try your best in high school that is the way for a good student .

Some people prefer graduate one year early , they has reasons, they wants to finish the career for to help the family or some people just finish the high school and go to work. is probably is the bigger reason why some people choose that opinion. for me both reason is good because you need to stay in school for to be successful and understand why some persons wants to graduate early they wants to help his/her family so both options that is very good.

Four years in high school is the bets option can you choose because you learn more, study more, and prepare more , for me that is the good way for to successful in life. Probably be more hard but you can do it, you need to try the best do yo have for in the future you will be a good person with a good job and can help your family. when help your family you are a good person and recognize that job was your parents did for you so keep going and do it a 4 years in high school this is good for success in life .",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0

Succes is not somethig everyone can reach specally without fails and enthusiams. Fail mades people stay down but people decide if yhey want to be down or work harder until they success.

Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the best soccer playes in all the world. When he begins his soccer correar ,he was seen as a normal soccer player, he fail some many times. There were soccer games when he did not score any goals or his team loss. His enthusiasm made him work harder and harder. Hard work made him the person who he is now, he is considered by so many people the best soccer player of all the history but is wasen't easy, fails made him work harder in order to success in his correar after 15 years he keep working hard to be succefully in life.

Enthusiam made people work harder until they reach succes. Enthusiam is the feeling that makes people go foward even they fail multiple times. When people have the type motivation fail is just a symple word becuase most of the people want to keep trying until they finally succes in life.

My mom is a good example , a few months ago she was trying to get her Driver Licence Permit. In order to get it she had to took a test that consist about all the rules in the road. She fail the first time, she was sad beucause she could not get her permit but she had a big motivation inside her that impulsed her to go and retake the test again. She fail the test twice , she never give up she worked hard to pass the test. She did not tooked the test 3 or 4 times, she toked 5 times until she finally passed the test and she got her permit, months later she go her Driver license. She fail so many times but she never give up. When you want to succes does not matter how many times you fail, you most get up work hard until you succes . As you can see, succes consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.",3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.0
81B5D8CBA063,"The limitation of human contacted due to the use of technology has a negative effect on people. It prevents the young generation of today basis social skills. It allows bulling on the internet. It also allows trolling on the internet.

First, Technology interferes with student social skills. For example, the student walks into the class room they are in their phones 24/7 of the day. In the class room the students are on the computers playing video games instead of interacting with one another. In a way people are trapped in their own world it stops people from learning about them self and others.

Second, someone can post a video to make a person feel bad about them self attempt suicide. Or a person can post a picture where their drunk and they post it on Facebook and tag them on it and on Instagram. I saw a video on YouTube.

A girl from Australia is getting bullied online, and at school also on the intent and her family had to move at lest 3 time because of this issue.

Lastly charting rooms where you can meet serial killers. fake news post on Twitter spreading rumors for an example

Michelle Obama is running for president in 2020.

The limitation, First, it percent the young generation basis social skills. Secondly it allows bulling on the internet. Lastly it also allows trolling on the internet. In my opinion we should turn off our phones for at lest 1 to 2 day and going out to eat with our friends with out our phones. In school teachers should wait for students out side the door with a box so they can't use their phones during class. So on bulling last longer and that goes beyond the internet so in conclusion should be more stricter, technology limits people talking about their issues.

Students, teachers, and others employees have responsibilities in their houses and others places after school. Also, fathers can get a bad attitude about why theirs kids need to be ten hours at the school. Schools should not follow this model by extending the school two hours.

First, some fathers believe that extending the school by two hours their kids will get more stressed. For example, extending the school by two hours students will need to do more homework, test, and projects. Students can feel like they can not do all of the work what the teacher give to them. A lot fathers doesn't have a good transportation for can pick up their kids at the school that late. Therefore, schools should not follow this model by extending the schools by two hours.

Second, some students have responsibilities after school. For example, some of them have sports, drama classes, and jobs. Extending the school for two hours can cause that these students can lost their jobs or some hours, they can not go to drama classes, and can not go the their sports practices. For other way, students need to have some rest of all. Schools should not follow this model by extending the school two hours.

For instant, extending schools for two hours and four-day school, students can have three days free. Students can have more free time, they can hangout more with their friends, and they can have more rest. Consequently, with four-day school and extending for two hours students can get more stress, and their grade can go down. Schools should not follow this model by extending school for two hours.

Extending school for two hours, will cause that fathers will get a bad attitude, and some students will lost their jobs, sport practice, etc. Students will feel like they can not do it, and their grade will go down.

Impressions are special to some people but it also could effect people in certain ways. Ways where your whole behavior might change or attitude or maybe your whole person. When we first meet people we see their first impressions and we see on how they are or we check on how their behavior is. We all have a instict on where we look at some people and judge but we also see the attitude in the people. First impressions are special sometimes because you dont know who you are going to meet next and on how they are good or if they have some bad in them.

Everybody is unique in many different ways. People do say that first impressions is impossible to change. I think it's impossible becuase people are very different everybody is different and sometimes we just have to accept it.

have good relationship with your friends and make someone trust in you to tell their secret to you. Well that is what i think about Seeking multiple opinion.

Seeking multiple opinion can make someone trust in you. When someone trust in you, he or she can tell you their secret about everything they have in secret. If someone trust in you he or she will know that you are a good friend. For example,

if you do something wrong to your friend who trust in you, She or her is going to forgive you when you say sorry because, he or she trust in you. Being nice and respectful for example, not saying bad word to someone to be depressed, saying please when you are asking someone for something can also make someone trust in you.

Seeking multiple opinion can make you have good relationship with someone.

Having a good relationship with someone is a good thing to do in life.

Having a good relationship with someone can make him or her get close to you . Helping your friend for example, helping him or her with his homework or something he or she needs help with , advising him or her to do the right if he or her did something wrong, being nice and respectful to everyone can also make someone have a good relationship with you.

Seeking multiple opinion allow you to make new friends. Sometime when you are making new friends you dont just have to make friends, you have to think about it .

Make a friend who respect everyone, correct you when you do something wrong and someone who is there for you because, when something happen to and you have a bad friend, he or she will not help you but, If you have a good friend, he or she will help you when you are in a bad situation. Good friends are all way there for you when you have a problem with something or someone.

If all the schools are agree about to extending two hours more, then they are braking the rule to converse more energy and resources. It is a lot of things that schools can use and the principal thing that school are using is energy. In the school office all the teachears are working all the time making copies, works and they are doing a lot of files.

Second, it's not necessary to extending two hours more in the schools, students can do campaigns to how reduce the energy or making groups of people and try to do things that help to conserve more energy.

Take those classes online or videos conferencing is not the same thing like to be able to go to classes. In class students can ask about any question they have or get the information they are looking for, and the schools teacher can see how they are learnig but, online they don't have much oction like read a book or be able to ask any question they have to anybody.

Attend to classse is great is a oction from student to choose but is the smart oction for for student who know what they want to do in they future. Schools is a place where students have the desition by you're own. There is where students can start makeing options and try finish what they really dream. Be able to atted classes from home is hard thing to discuss but when students are able to go there is great bacause is where they have to be and never give up during that time.

School is not a principle to starts getting information about how thing are working, or what options we can choose for be a porofessional after schools. Prevent oction in schools is preposterous because that is not ducing, good octions during school.

Students who rually have the decition to go to schools even know the distace but they are benefit. that is a oction, but when they get there is alot of information and option they can lissend from teachers and other students. When they go to schools they are giving a step more every day, to them life and they are benefit in school for the alot of option they can have in schools.

Schools is a benifif for all yung people to learnd how start life, when you get out from schools and have a good job. for have the opportunite, students need finish school firts. Not matter the distance or the skills they have during that period time. after that they will see how everything is change to be better in they way.

For somo students is hard to make that decition.

But when they have the oction and they can do it is a good thing because they can learning more about and have more opportunities when they graduate from schools thay have good jobs and more oction to choose.

Some students think is preposterous to to make decition in schools, bacause is alot of oction they can choose, and alot thing they want to be but they only have somo octions. For somo of then is hinder to go and pick that oportunities.

Instance when students live far fom schools is hard to get there they need like a car to get there, but parents are allways insist to students to go to schools not matter how hard is all they wants is a good future for they childrens.

School is a personality decition in life, butsmart decition for people who is looking for good oction in life. Ertheless who finish school have more oction the people who don't finish. During school students need have to be inmate because schools is a hard time.

For students in schools is like stairway, because they walk aroung getting information, that is a good oction for teachers, to stall information and try to preparate students to then life. One way to be a perfectionist is graduste from schools.

i can also understand why some may say ""almost impossible"" because technechly you kinda can. for example if both of you say ""can we start over"" or something like that. your always going to have that impression from the first time you guys ever meet. so really it goes both ways how someone may take it. i personal dont agree with that because it dosent sound right or feel right. some may move on and ectually forget. while others may not and mentally remmber.

Although some people thought failure is not good for their life, nevertheless, some were thought failure plays an important role in their life, because, it makes them to learn more about themselevs and become successful in their life.

Failure can make people to learn more about their self. Because after failing, people can know themselves better than before. They can know about their strength and weakness. For example, Generic_Name told her friend that she is good at Science and English. But she said she is not good at math. For that, she don't like to do math at home or do it by herself. She always copied from board in classroom. Because she never try to do it. Suddenly, one day in her math class, she was called by her teacher to solve a math in board. First she was saying that she doesn't know how to do it. Fortunately after looking at the question, she did it. And then after this, she got to realize that she know how to solve the equation problem. Which makes her feel confident about math and herself. While she was talking, one of her friend interrupted her. And said that, he was satisfied with her math. Unfortunately, she failed one of her test, which makes her feel bad. After test correction, she got to understand what she missed. So she prepared herself for retake and she took the test second time and then she pass the test on second time with a good grade. Some people who fail on first time can also prepare themselves for next time. Which can take them one step ahead of their goal.

Furthermore, failure can make people successful in their life. To become successful people have to have positive enthusiasm. For example, Generic_Name is senior of Generic_School. In order to graduate she need to pass her English SOL. Because when she was a junior, she didn't pass her English 11 SOL. But this time she tried her best with positive energy and she didn't gave up. As a result, she pass her English SOL this time. Some people also cannot reach their goal in first time. But that doesn't mean, they never can be successful. To reach a goal, people need to pass the small steps first. If they fail, they can try their best for second time. And always there is a second option for every problem. For to become success, people need to learn from failure and they have to try again and again. And then they can become successful on thier life.

Overall, without loss of enthusiasm people can reach their goal by failure. People can successfully reach in their goal if they learn from failure. From failure people can learn more about themselves. And people have to have positive energy and hope to handle any situation.

Teens are able to say no but they choose they wrong road. If you choose to hang out with people that aren't good for your health and mindset then they aren't people to stick around with. Looking after yourself is better than winding up somewhere you shouldn't be with the people you shouldn't be with. It has been proven that mom's all around the world are able to point out whose a true friend that cares for you and who isn't.

Teens knowing this still choose to skip. They lose that control of thinking for themselves. Every time a teen even thinks about skipping it's bad character.

Teens living in places that are broken down that aren't healthy living condition often end up in gangs and dropping out of school. Either then teens living in good home conditions they end up going to collage and having a good life.

Now days everything you need is only a click of a button away. this makes life easier and better. techonolgy is evolving such as humans are evolving too. on the other hand, technology can alsow be used as a bad thing. it could be used as a source of bullying. Technology has given us the privilage to be able to play a game with many people even though we are all far away. When tchnology was not as developed, you had to write a letter, mail it , and wait weeks for a response. Now days thanks to technology you can talk to someone on the other side of the world and not have that time gap to wait for there response. Technology has also made the world a safer place. we now have all types of camers for different things. before technology it was almost impossible to stop someone from breaking into your home or catching someone stealing. however, today we have camers protecting our homes, stores have cameras to catch shoplifters. Technology plays a big rol in education. Students have better education because of technology. you dont have to go to a library to buy a book to learn something. Today you can look everything up on the internet.

Technology might be a good thing and make life easier but it can alsow be used as a bad thing. Many people use technology for hacking. Hackers can steal credit card information, your personl information, and other personal things. Other people use technology for stalking, or tracking someone.. there are many dar webs on the internet, also known as the 'BLACK MARKET'. On these websites human parts are sold for a big amounnt of money. Technology can also be used for human traficking. and for selling drugs. The end of the day, i belive technology can be a very helpful tool for humans but it all depends on how one uses it. in conclusion, I belive the limination of human contact due to the use of technology has a positive effect on people's lives.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0
88ECDCC89475,"Individuality

I am agree to be independent in a world is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment, because you can feel proud of yourself. Independent means that you have the control of the you doing, also signify not looking to others for one's opinions or for guidance in conduct. I think that when you decide make the things for yourself is because you are ready to confront the different situations that the life give you.

The individuality is one that pursues a markedly independent course in thought or action. That means that your actions have influence in you, all that you doing have a purpose.

For example, when you want something but is spend, you work hard for it, and can get it. This going to make you happy because just you know how you worked for buy it.

Be yourself in the world is not simple, need to have good thoughts, these are the key for the most big accomplishment. For example, when someone tell you do this, you need to think about it, and decide it is good or not , if is something bad that going to affect you. Some people no want that you win or protrude in the life, or not believe that you can do. But you need have the capacity to show them, that you can and not need help for obtain it.

Accomplishment is the quality or ability, the result of something. Make big accomplishment for yourself, teach you that you can do all that you want, but only if you believe and have trust in you. Sometimes we don't something that we want for fear, because think that the result not going to be favorable or how you thoughts. For example, sometimes many opportunities came for your life, and you never accept. But when you take the decisions of do, you see that is possible. Now know that you are able to do anything that you want.

In my conclusion be yourself in the world is good, because your learn about the life, also to do things that you not believe possible. I think that good thoughts can make you successful. Also I think that do all individuality is not easy, but not impossible. The biggest accomplishment only are caused when you do things for yourself. That is why I think that be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5
89863E1AF982,"Should the first impressions care and show who individuals are? First impressions are almost impossible to change that is why people always have to worry about their actions because people can not go back the time, can lose opportunities, and can get on trouble.

First of all, people can not go back the time and try to fix what they had done wrong. For example, some individuals who gave a bad impression in their first time at work because they did not how to deal with the costumer and they had a bad attitude but then the next day they realized that they have to change their attitude it may be too late because the costumers already complained. All in all, people have to do their best the first time even if life is too difficult because time does not come back.

In addition, Individuals can lose opportunities by their first impressions. For instance, some people that apply to a job but they did not present on time will give their new boss a bad impression about them that he or she will want to fire them. All in all,people always has to make a good impression the first time and they will have better opportunities.

However, some people may argue that first impressions can be change because people may have regrets and they will try to apply themselves and do their best in what they did wrong in the past .This argument is weak though because not everything in life can be change easily. For example, some people may regrets how they were in high school with their teachers but they can not do nothing now because some of their teacher already past away. Even though, first impressions are impossible to change because no all the time people will have the opportunities to a second chance.

Finally, people can get on trouble for how they show the first time. For example,some individuals that deal with other people always has to give a great impression the first time. Additionally, people that works at a restaurant has to have a good appearance because if they do not have it they will lose costumers,lose their jobs. In a word, a good impression the first time will save people from trouble.

People always have to be careful in what they show or do the first time. There are great reasons for always make a good impression the first time because individuals can not go back the time,can lose opportunities, and can get on trouble. What would be if all individuals make a bad impression the first time?",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5

Play games like soccer, football ride a bike, make running races with your friends, or baseball, play music but not so loud because the police may come, invite you son/daughter boyfriend/girlfriend and their parents to come to the park, maybe bring some snacks for the afternoon. Spending time outdoors with your family and friends is like having a camping day, is there is a river that you are allowed to fish, it will be a great idea to go fish and catch some fish to eat them, but the most important thing is to have fun with all your friends and family. To admire how beautiful is the nature, to forget all your problems while listening to the sound of the birds reconnect with you family and to remember how important is to the love of your family and friends, Because some people don't have family and friends and there are all alone that's why is so important how much the people around you that appreciate you so much and you have to be so thankful for that. In the night you can make fire to put mash mellow to the fire and than eat them with cookies one on top and the other one on the bot on and while eating the mash mellow the people can make a large group to tell scary story maybe some jokes but the best at the end the best part of being outdoors is the you are having fun fun with your friend and family, but also you are breathing fresh air from the nature. Community parks, state parks, and national parks are very important for the community because is a place where someone can have fun while their are with their friends, with their boyfriend/girlfriend, or with their wife/husband you can make a party, you can go run, walk with your dog or just take a walk yo relax your brain and refletionate and to forget about all your problems for just a moment and I think parks are place that we have to take care of because thats where are the home of some birds animals and plants to grow.

To some who haven't these are what they mean hyperbaly is something you would compare to like for an example he bacame more red than this chile. Their is lots of way to use hyperbaly. What does onmanpia mean? It's an sound affect you would see when you are reading a book or watching a cartoon here are some examples for this word the owl whoosh away flying as quick whoosh is a sound affect when watching a cartoon you could seen the character falling then you see the word boom when he falls. People really get confused with simile or metaphor when they see it or and personafaction and hyperbaly it almost means the same thing but they are not. Onmanpia it the easiest but hard the write half of the people that first start to learn this have a hard time one. saying it's name or two. writing it because for sure I did. What is simile? well simile is when there is like or as in it there are ways like he is as sad as the clouds there are two thing they are comparing it too and it has as but metaphor could have as or like in it but still wouldn't be a simile. You could say as I was walking I stumble across an old friend of mine your using as in the sentence that's a metaphor. It is important for you to know this so when you are reading or watching t. v or something this lesson will remind you about what you just learned. Personafaction is a long and confusing word but the meaning for this long word is almost the same as hyperbaly y'all already know what's the meaning but personafiction is used in sentences like the clouds don't look very happy they look mad the meaning for this is that it looks like it's about to rain. really tricky to not get hyperbaly or personafaction correct.,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0
8BE20A3524AE,"Students should commit to a career at a young age or specifically by the time they get to highschool. Most students know what they wanna do when they get to highschool so its a good idea to commit to a career that you are interested in and enjoy so you can start preparing for a job/career in that field of study.

Yes, students should commit to a career at young age mostly because always a good idea to start earlier than later. In addition this gives more time for preparation and being able to learn more about the career of your choice by selecting electives in highschool that are in that field of study of the career you wanna pursue. Highschool offers many electives and academy classes that students should take advantage of to stay ahead of the game in what they wanna do as a career. Its a smart way and fun way to go deeper in the career you want and learn more from it and have it help you in the future. Commiting early on is key to being more successful in that career and for your journey to that career.

Secondly, commiting to a career at a young age is useful to build up confidence in that student so they have the urge to want to pursue that career and be more serious about what they wanna do. Most students don't take their career selections seriously until senior year or until they graduate highschool. Another reason is that if you're confident in what you wanna do you'll be able to achieve your goal. For example i wanna become an athletic trainer/fitness instructor and i am taking the fitness instructor class next year for my senior year to prepare and learn more about what i wanna do. They also offer a test at the end of the year to certify you as a fitness instructor so i am confident in taking that test and still expand my study at college because i believe and i really wanna have this as a career.

Lastly, If you commit to a career early enough you can start working as part time for that career for example, after highschool and if i pass the fitness instructor class and get certified as a fitness instructor i could apply for a part time job at a gym or something related to that and help others out to reach their goal. While i would still go to college to expand my learning in althetic training having a part time job in doing what i love would be great. It could also help out with expenses and anything else. The earlier the better and more opportunitys would be opened to students.

In conclusion, students should commit to a career sometime in highschool just so they can start preparing and builidng up confidence in what they wanna do. Take advantage of classes in highschool because they are free and very helpful for the future. Overall once you find someting you like doing and want to do that as a career then commit.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0

Their parents work day and night if they got out of high school with a diploma they will be able to work full time and help their parents with money or even move out of the house and start living independently, another reason is that teenagers would be more mature for their ages and learn everything they need to know to be successful in life.

Nowadays employees are looking for young adults to work for them but also with experience, that means if students graduates in three years they could gain experience by working on a restaurant,store et in one year. Other teenagers will go to college or university if they know what they want to study and know what they want to be, they will graduate at a good age not young, but not that old,they would have more time, energy, and interest.

Student's dont have to wake up early in the mornings and be tried and if Student's come to school all tried they wont do the work most of the time. If the Student's take online classes then can finish anytime without have to worried about the class finishing and not hand in an incomplete assignment. This way if student's are really sick and can't come to school and are going to be out of school for weeks then this will help the student's keep on track with the class. If the schools did the online classes they wont have to be worried about snow days. A other benefit is being at home everyday and not have to move around a lot. Students would focus more because they have no one to talk to during the online classes. A other reasons this is good is that student's that dont come to school a lot can stay at home while they can do the school work at home instead of go to school and not showing up. Student's would probably have better grades because they would be finishing the work. It would be easy the get help if the student's dont understand they can just search it up on the internet or ask someone in their house for some help. The student's can take brakes during this time so they dont tried of doing a lot of work. This can also help the student's with computer skill while doing online school. Student's would get better information while doing this and it will come a long way in the future for them. A other good reason is that the student's can show their mom or dad they did their work so they can do what ever they went after because most of time student's dont show their mom or dad that they have been doing work in school. This would make somethings easier for people like the people who dont like to come to school or the people who dont like to wake up early in the morning.

Although you have one hundred low goals it's impossible say ""one hundred low goals is equal to a high goal"" because a high goal can to become successful and though you'll do one hundred low goals it's almost impossible you become successful.

It's very important have high goals in our life to be a great person, taking high goals you can to detach in anything, however, taking low goals you never can to be successful

To start, it's very important have high goals to be a great person. For example: Keanu Reeves, a susseccfuly actor, is a great person showing the money is not important with his life. some times a high goals no always is have money, also can to be a personal goal.

To next, taking a high goal you can to detach in anything. For example: Kobe Bryan, the bigger player of the NBA, was the best player in basketball because he wanted become the best. You are not the schism, if you work for you like you can to be the best in anything.

To finish, taking low goals you never can to be successful. For example: somebody having low goals never can learn of his mistakes, furthermore, that person never can to grow. but if you want to become successful you need to find anything that to feel passion and going to for that.

Has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people's lives?

And many ways I think it does, and in others I think it doesn't. It depend on the person, that's what I believe.

It has a positive effects in the way that it can help people that feel along entertain thyself without nobody, I don't think that there are many things nothing worst then feel along. that can do bad things to people brains, and I am not saying that there is nothing worst, I mean be in prison, not had a job, die... and I had seen many people who prefer all those things before then be along, and checking out book, shopping, playing games, listening music in your favorite app, Pandora... or watching you favorite show in YouTube, Netflix or whatever other app that you use is positive way of use the technology.

But you know in the worth nothing is perfect,like my grandfather used to say ""there has to be bad things, so that there could be good things"". every positive thing has to have it on negative thing.

it has a negative effect on people lives because with the advice of the technology phone, and others the people are losing the interest in norma things, like some people don't even care about family reunion. I mean I never really care about that staff neither. I always preferred to be with my cousin, and my childhood friends then be in my house talking about boring things, but now you can not have simple conversation with some people because when you are talking to them most of the time they are in they phone doing who knows what, and I don't know about you. but to me that's a disreperfull way to tell me that you don't care about what i'm saying, and that could made people dislike you.

technology is one of the greatest things ever invented, it made more easier the communication, it give entertainment to the people, it inform us of every that is happening in the worth, even in the space, and we don't have to read a whole book to find answer. technology has made every more easier, you can do almost anything, you can shopping without leave your house, order food...

and all this stuff made people lazy, maybe they ask thyself why should I do this when my small phone or computer can do it for me, why should I date someone to talk to them when I can do it by my phone, why should I have to have a conversation with somebody when there is a whole lot of thing that I can do in my phone or competed. And maybe you are going to keep asking the same question to yourself unto the day that there would be no body by your side.

In the work is very important to arrive all the time with good attitude and be amiable. The customer can stay happy with the workers work with a good attitude. The customer give tips, and the workers are happy. The workers don't have problems with the chief or the boss.

Second, I think that the attitude is important have in the school because every student have to go to the school everyday with a good attitude. The attitude is one of the main charisma that a student has to have. The students with a good attitude everyone spectable by othres students. The attitude is important to have friendly relations. When they are graduated they remenber that it's important to be good with others and continued in to be good person with a good attitude.

Finally, in the house it's important to keep a good character with good attitude. I think that in the family is more important to have a good attitude. If everyone have a good attitude we live in armony and don't had problems to each others. The attitude in the family is one of the most important that everyone has and live without of problems.

In conclusion, the attitude is one of the main charism that one person can had. many people don't have a good attitude with others , but it's important have good attitude in everywhere to be a good people.    ",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,3.0
8E99E989024A,"We should have after school homework club because, some students need help with their classwork, some students don't pay attention and they could use after school to understand the topic and what they have to do, and they could improve their grade for classwork and homework. For example when I was in Elementary school, I use to stay after school for homework club because I couldn't understand anything so I stayed after and got help from my teacher.

To begin with the homework club is good because for some students that need help could stay after with her/his teacher and do what they have to do with their teacher. Also they could get help by finishing their homework and classwork. Some students go home and ask their parents for help but some parents doesn't remember the question or don't know how to do it. So it's helpful for students to have homework club and get help from their teacher.

My other reason is that some students doesn't understand the question and it's hard for somebody that doesn't understand their language. For example when I came here three years ago I didn't know any English neither my parents so i had to stay after, and get help from my teacher to understand what is the question asking me to do. Another example would be when students don't pay attention in class or fall a sleep it's good for them to stay after school and get help from their teacher to understand.

Finally students could get improve by staying after and learn better. Some students have bad grade for homework or their classwork, so they could stay after to get improved. Also students can improve their understanding. For example my cousin use to have bad grade for homework, so he stayed after school, and got help from his teacher, and learn better, and got improved.

Lastly all of this reasons and details are why school should have after school homework club. Students need help with their homework and to get improve. Also some students don't have time in classrooms to ask their teacher for help so they could stay after school and get help after school. Teacher also can support students to stay after school and do their homework.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0

for example: my bother is taking online classes because he works full time, and wants to support the family at the same time.

the students will have more space and time to review the same, if they did not understood it.

they will have more privacy they will have a flexible schedule, and they can take the class when they want.

they will not miss any class for any weather changes, etc.

Personally I think that is a great opportunity for us, because if we are not able to attend at school, the school gave us the opportunity to take online classes that way we can finish our classes and to graduate, also it is not like that you have to be there an specific time.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,2.0,3.0

Generic_City park it's located in Pennsylvania and is one of the places I would like to go there with my family. One of the reasons is because there are great attractions, like roller coasters and games. One thing I would like to see as soon as I arrive is the Chocolate factory and the Lazy river that is in the Aquatic park.

As I said before, ""There are awesome attractions in

Generic_City park"" let me talk to you about this amazing roller coaster I would love to ride and the name of that roller coaster is 'The Super dooper looper'.

The Super dooper looper is one of the greatest roller coasters and the reason is because this roller coaster has more loops then the other attractions and one of the loops is super big. But that's just the beginning, there is also one section in Generic_City park that I would like to go too, and is the area where all the video games are and you can win tickets every time you win a game. You can win prizes with those tickets and you can also buy food near that place.

I also said that I wanted to see the chocolate factory. The chocolate factory shows you the process of how they make that delicious chocolate, you can see everything there, from the beginning to the end, that is one of the best places I would love to go because you can't only see how they make chocolate, you can also buy it and feel the taste of the best chocolate ever 'Kisses'. The chocolate 'kisses' is one of my favorite chocolates that's why I would like to see the chocolate factory.

The aquatic park it's the best place to not feel to hot when is super sunny outside. Everybody sweats when they scream and feel the adrenaline of the roller coasters. After all of that you want to just relax and enjoy your day after walking and waiting in line, Well the Lazy River is one of the pools you would like to go in while you do nothing. The lazy river is one of all the attraction I would like to go. The fun part is that in the lazy river is that you can talk with your friends, and enjoy the journey after a long and fun day.

And that's is one of the places that I would like to go and maybe you will like to go, because Generic_City Park is a fun place where you can have fun with your family and friends, and have an amazing and unforgettable day, with so much adventures and fun.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5
8F5F3F2519DA,"what do you think about a program that school provides to pair the younger students with the older students? It can be a exellent choice for the younger students and the older students. Therefore, many younger students have less experience than the older students, so the older students have more experience than them. Older student have already halfway done going to the school. Also, it has a great effect on them to be a good students. This program would help both the older and the younger student in responsibilities, socialization and improving behaviors.

Certainly, this program could help both the older and the younger student in taking care of their own responsibilities. They both can get some useful knowledge that it might be helpful for them to take care of their responsibilities. It could make a good change on how they used to do their chores and homeworks. Taking care of responsibilitis is hard but if they work together than it will get more easier and better on it. It will make them productive and helpful on doing works. Like I said, it will also be useful for their future, when they will have job and other things to do.

however, this program could help both the older and the younger students in socialization. It will make a great change on how they used to work in group. Usually, younger students don't like to talk to the older students, so it can make them be more confident to talk to others. Some older and younger students like to be anti social but if they join the program and work together than it will make them social. It will make a good impact in spending time with others and playing outdoor games. Also, it will effect them in good way to make some new friends.

Therefore, this program will also help both the older and younger students in improving behaviors. If the older students are not respecting and talking polite with others than it will change them. Like I said, it will also help them both improve on how they used to treat other peoples. It will help them to speak a good langauge and be nice to the people they don't know. Also, it will have a good impact on their future when some students will like to a teacher when they grow up and teach their students about behaviors.

In the conclusion, this program could be really helpful for both of them. It could effect both of them to learn something new that they have not know about yet. Therefore, it could be a great program for the school to start and earn money. This program could develope their minds in a good way that will impact their future and their daily life. It could be great and wonderful to learn the things that the students have been struggling in. Also, it will lead them to be a good students and a good person when they grow up.

8FF3A8F178E1,"If you wake up a day and you asked yourself what make a person different than other let me tell you that you are not the only one there are many other asked the same ( which is weird). But like John Lubbock says "" your character will be what yourself choose to make it"". I agree with John Lubbock because is important that you have to choose what will be your character traits and this are my reason. Firts reason is you create your own personality. The second reason is the you are not monotonous. And the last reason having others people respect.

When we create our own personality is means in a group of friend we are the funny, the serious, or the person the never pay attention what the other friend is saying ( that is me I never pay attention what my friends is seaying). Have your own personality is important because that is what make you unique when don't permit the other people influeneces with idea.

When a person is monotonous is they don't a different way to do the work they always is going to do the same every single thing for example in art class the teacher make a painting of a sundown and then they have to the same painting all the student is gonna put their own style to the same painting but this student is make a replica of the teacher work he don't put a different style or a different color.

Some people may says that be differentof the other people is no important. However having your own personality is very important and that is my tird reason, having your own personality can get other people respect and some is gonna says the why you are talking about. Well get respect from the others people with your personality can be healthfull because when you are good leader the workers respect you and they work more and if you still confesed well let me ask you if you work with boss the is always angry and he is always yell you will be confortable to work ( I don't belive) or your boss is always making jokes you know to be ""cool"" you will respect him (I don't believe).

9255DC307B75,"Have you ever been in school and your teacher tells you to come after school to get your work done? Well i think that having after school clubs is good because it can help us in school. It will help then get they work done faster, and also better for them to understand. Sometimes kids at home dont like to do they homework but if they do activities after school they would actually want to do the work so they can do the activitties.

To begin with kids get bored of just sitting there doing homework but if their actually doing activitties they would'nt be bored and actually work on they homework. If the kids are active and are having fun they would get things done faster and easier like say a student was gonna pay sports and you tell him he has to finish they homework in order to play if the kid loves the sport he would do it. nowadays kids like to do they work in activitties such as math games, card games, and many more. The teachers can explain the work better for them so they can understand and learn it better.

To continue you must show them that the work is very important, and the kids would actualy take it seriously and they could actually improve there grade. Kids nowadays don't really be trying to take things serious so the adults got to push them and show them that there homework is important and has a big impact on your grade. Its better to have someone constantly on your back because it will help you in the future it's always good to have people push you to succeed. A lot of kids give up in school and don't be wanting to do they homework thats why when soembody is doing activitties and learning they wouldn't give up on they selfs that easy on they selfs. the students also get bored of being in a quiet room just working on they work students like to be active not just sitting in one place bored.

Last but not least you got to put effort in the work to be able to understand it and to get it done or if not you would be having a very rough time on your assighnment. But always remember never give up and keep pushing for your goal because not only in school will you be stressing. Lastly these are some of the reasons why I think it would be a good idea for our schools to have afterschool activities it will help a lot.  ",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5

Winston Churchill was a British Minister.

He was a writer famous for his phrase that he ussually used.

Once said that ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.""

I belive, that failure is an important element that plays in the persuit of success, because the failure lead to succes, failure is unavoidable, learn from your mistakes, and the failures often leads to problems.

One reason is the success that consist of going from failure to failre without loss the enthusiasm.

Failure is unavaidable, the path of success is not a straight on.

Every people have to fails sometimes in the life, but that is part of the life.

For example sometimes, invest money in some bussiness, but we don't know if go to win a lot money, or lost all the money or just one part of money.

If for some reason we fails, doesn't matter, we need to try again, maybe that would be the success to have your company owner. Never say not, before try it.

Another reason, is to learn from your mistakes, if you make a mistakes at least you know, not to do it again.

A failure might put end thing idea or opportunity, but lead you others.

If you ready failure and you know what was the mistakes try to find a solution, and not come back with the same ideas, you need to learn for each mistakes.

For example, if I say something wrong, like English word, if somebody heard me and corrigir me, I try to not say that word again.

One more reason, failure often leads to problem, we need to solve our problems and getting throught difficul times makes you smarter and stronger as a person.

By dealing with your failures you will to be prepared and have most experienced in the future.

If you know that to fails before, so you are somebody with most experience in the life, you know that if you have a important roll in your work, that is why you to fails in some time, but you need always to continue ahead.

Everyone have differents kind of problems, but each problem have solution.

If for find solution is possible that we go to fails, just doing that, we need to solve each problem without doesn't matter what come ahead we always want the success.

In conclusion, failure can change who you are, and what path you're on the life.

To fails in our life is something that cannot to avoid, but we not wanted to be a failure always, we want to change and have success. Each mistakes is a success more in our life, I think that failure it plays an important role in the persuit for the success. We need to pass for differents path and in each one, we go to learn new things.

92EA64272FB4,"High school is like a preschool for young adults, where they get a chance to explore the world much earlier.

Students at grade nine through twelve get to learn what they want to be at a young age. It gets them more interested in the careers they choose in the nearest future. As they get through high school, they will know what path to take and what needs to get done. As soon as these young adults leave they won't have to stress of what their going to be. It's agreeable for students to start looking into their career at a young age.

Through out the years in High school, students will have the rights to choose their own courses, which follows up to their interest. For example: culinary arts, design multi media, masonry, and more. They can also choose any subjects such as: math, English, science, and history. These courses can also help those students with their future careers. While these students are learning they realize what they like and what they don't like. The upcoming goal for them by the time they leave high school is what they are going to become.

As these young adults think of what their going to be, they will think twice on some careers. Which gives them time to research options, and that research will reflect on which career is the best for them. While being young an thinking of a career students will have enough time to sort the ones the students like and the ones they dislike. The average life Span of a human is up to 75 years, which means 18 of those years can resolve of what the students are going to do when they grow up. Teen's can dream what they could be but can they put the effort in trying.

As in college, students will have to get credits to graduate high school, and need to pass a amount of exams.

From there the students path will flow to what college they'll go, when thinking young they got to think smart, which means they got to put the effort. When thinking of a career at a young age the students will have most of everything planned. Its never too much to notice that a student has more potential young than old because they got more time.

The students won't stress out because their not out in the world alone finding what to do.

Teens can commit to any career because they have had a whole lot of time to think of any career.

Its never bad for a kid to have dreams of being a cop and going for that career. Its always good to plan ahead, to always think and do. It's great that a young adult wants to think of it's future.

93385DED39E7,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

When i was 15 years old, i broke my leg and that made me incapable of going to the school for 3 months, during those 3 months i didn't get any support to keep track on my classes because the school i was attending didn't had distance learning; Consequently, i almost failed my school year, because of this i support the option of having distance learning.

The fact that some schools have the equipment to offer distance learning is motivating, because it gives an opportunity to teenagers that struggle to get the education they need and this can be for several reasons that can limit them to get to their schools such as a medical condition, being isolated from their schools, or any circumstances that can happen during the school year; Furthermore, having distance learning as an option that is beneficial to the students and to the schools in general.

Students who are having problems to get to their schools, for factors such as not having money for the transportation or the schools are located too far from them, will benefit of having distance learning. For example, if a student can't get to his school because he can't afford a way to get to their classes on time; Consequently, the student is probably going to fail his school year for not being able to get to his classes, this shows that having distance learning support is beneficial for students that struggle with this type of problems.

Students who have for a medical condition, will have problems to get to their schools because of their medical state.

For example, a teenager that suffer from osteoporosis is hardly going to be able to get to his educational institution, and this is not going only to affect the student in his education is also going to damage his life by not having that knowledge that he needs to be progress as a person in his life; Furthermore, having support of distance learning to student that can't arrive to schools is an important and necessary characteristic that every schools must have in their options, this demonstrates that having distance learning support can help student that suffer from a disease that makes them unable of being present in school.

One of the most important characteristic of having distance learning is that it can be useful in scenarios where the students are in danger of coming to the school for something like a pandemic that would make the schools close, losing a huge a amount of days that will have an impact on the school year; Similarly, to what is happening with the COVID-19 in several country's around the world that are getting infected by this disease and where they are closing the schools because of this virus, however with the use of temporary distance learning students would be able to keep on track of their studies even when a disease or something similar to this is happening at the moment.

On the other hand distance learning can be used in a wrong way, where students simply don't care about their classes, this shows that is not a perfect system that needs to be used only when is necessary to put on practice.

In conclusion the use of distance learning in schools is important and useful to the students when they have problems to get to their educational institution and that it also can be used in scenarios where the student won't be able to assist to the school.",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,3.5

93B8C8DAFE20,"Doing projects at school is really fun when it comes to working in groups. I think working in a groups is more beneficial because of the extra help you'll have. You wont have to work a lot because your group will help and share the project so that everyone has a chance in it. Group projects will show you how to work with others and maybe even help you make new friends. Projects of any kind will look and be better when in groups, lots of ideas will be on the table for everyone to look and pick from.

Working at school is hard. You get lightheaded and maybe even get tired. Group projects are so helpful because the project will be split up into parts where everyone in your group can take a part of it, all they have to do is post it together when finished. Having not to do all of it by your self is super nice.

Another beneficial gift in working in groups is that you will be able to learn teamwork. Learning that is a good skill because you'll need teamwork for your life time. New people, classmates, workers, and much more will want to work with you because of how you and your team get along with one another.

Projects of all kinds have to look good. Lets say your having a hard time trying to find the perfect color background for your poster. You can talk to your classmates who are in your group and ask them if they have any ideas of what color you should pick. Together you can find the perfect color and together you can make your project look perfect and maybe be the one that has the best project in your who class.

Group working is so much better for everyone because you'll learn teamwork, learn that you'll always have help when you need it, and your projects will always look good and perfect. The more people in your group, the more help, care, and ideas you'll have for your project. You'll learn something new from all of this and others will to. This is why I think working in groups is more beneficial for schools and jobs. ",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0
93E62B4919A6,"People who value self-reliance are people that can make their own decisions. They know what to do when it comes to the important matters in life. They aren't dependent on other people when it comes to most things in life and know what to do to get past certain things. These people grow a lot mentally because they end up knowing a lot because they go through with the decisions themselves; they don't listen to other people and don't make their decisions based on what other people say.

Self-Reliant people know how to get through their important or ""life changing"" decisions. For Example: Buying your own house, getting married , and dropping out of school are all very important decisions that you and only you can make. They think through about what decision they are going to make. People that don't make their decisions on their own always depend on someone or something else, especially when they are very important. You can learn a lot from making important decisions by yourself and it can help you in the long run.

Self-Reliant people aren't dependent on other people and always follow their instincts. They know making your own decisions is better than being guided towards what decision to make. Being Independent also goes in the same category as making your own decision. You do everything by yourself when you are independent, all the decisions you've made has either had positives or negatives for your life, asking someone for their opinion is only going to make you more biased to that choice. People should make their own decisions based on what they want/need to do for their life.

Making your own decisions helps you grow mentally, every major decision you've made affects your life every day. Most people always seem to ask somebody for help on a very important decision,

while others just think about what they should do themselves. People should just follow their instincts, their gut feeling of what they want to do; they shouldn't listen to other peoples opinions. The people should always try to make their own decisions instead of always relying on the guidance of experts and authorities.",3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0
94131A88E955,"In my oppinon school is good how it is now. having go to go school for a couple of months straight across and then just have a couple of months off for summer. If they were to change the school routine to kids having to have breaks for 3-4 week's they wouldn't come back with the same effort as they do when they come back off of summer break.. For example if I were to leave shcool for 3-4 weeks I wouldn't want to come back to the same classes and with the same routine, It's just that Students do retain the information they teach they would have to go over it just so they get back on track. But the fact of having year-around school isn't it just doesn't make a diffrence. and im an sure that kids wouldn't like to have only 3-4 weeks off school after all the time they spend in school

This is why students should have a right amount of school and a certain amount of months off. a year-around school benifits teachers not students. because they if they did have a year- around teachers wouldn't have to worry about re-teahing it again to the students because they would expect them to already know what they are taking about. so they should have a regualr schedual for te schools board to follow.

But at the same time the fact of not having to go to school for weeks sounds good. when their break is over they would have to go back to school not only that but they would have to pick up from where the left off at first. I feel like leaving in the middle of a lesson that is important that really wouldn't have the studets as much. if they were to change the school routine it would just mess things up with the students and their grades and that would e more work of teachers. What if some important test is coming up for the students and they only have a certian amount of time to get things done within the time period and then they would leave on break what if the teacher couldnt get everything done in time then te whole class would fail the test.

This is why they should just leave school as it is just so that student's and teacher's wouldn't have to go throught all that trouble, Just get what they need to get done within the time they are their and then when they are done with all the work they needed to get done with they could leave for summer break, just so students dont stress over the facts that they have to get things done in a certain amout of time. These are some of the many reasons why they should have school for months and not take breaks inbetween school days just so that they have months off on their summer break. ",3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0
94EC7DF6EA74,"People these days dont go outdoors as much as they used to. I think that many people are avoiding going outside, because of cell phones. going outdoors is actually more fun than staying indoors doing nothing, because you can do a lot of activities. Some activities you can do is play sports, practice sports, run laps, and do exercise. I think that some people find outdoor activities enjoyable, because they can do activities with others and enjoy the weather while doing activities.

People should go outdoors more, because if they dont go outdoors and dont do activities, there is a chance that later on in life they can have weak bones. There are people who stay indoors just listening to music, but you can actually go outside and do activities while listening to music. If you dont like to play sports, exercise, or run laps you can just ride your bike. Riding your bike can actually help you later in life, because it can give you stronger bones and can improve your stamina and strength.

Another thing that you can do is play outdoor games, such as tag, freeze tag, and hide and go seek tag, but there is many more. These outdoor games can also improve your stamina and strength. A good time to go outdoors is when its sunny and when you have nothing to do. Also when your going outdoors make sure to bring someone with you so you can do activities with them. And if you have no one to do activities with head over to a local park to do activities with other people.

95540EBC3FC9,"With the development of education, every school always have classes to support student's natural abilities and students, who love arts, are also free to enroll and find out their strength. Beside that, they also need to release stressful after two or three hours from studying. It's a good condition for students to recharge and heighten their energy for the next efficient block when they take the classes of art but it wastes time for students who won't spend time to practice it.

Today, studying in high school, which turns to boring with almost students because they can't locate where they are, what they are interested in at school. In that case, finding the funny things, which is the best way to counter that situation, is helping us to reduce stressful and recharge us from hold blocks study. For example, there are multiple choices for us like enrolling a band, joining a drama, taking part in an art class for making motivation in studying . We must be required to take those classes because that also is what we choose.

Beside that, choosing to sign up an art class are not only helping students to clean up their brain, which become easily to adopt information from the following block, but also increase efficient- adoption. For instance, after a serious block with full information in our brain, we must to clean it up by singing, acting or drawing class, it will help our brain feel relaxing and ready for adopting more information. It also depends on our type of favorite in entertainment that your body and brain can feeling relax when we are into it.

We agree that every students should be required to take those classes but if such classes won't be electives to select student's natural abilities; a huge students, who aren't serious about a music, a drama, an art class, will make other students feel uncomfortable. Like they are going to sleep or make noise which effect to everybody around to enjoy their fresh time.

To sum up, we know students should take a class from arts to make them feel fresh after a tired day or two to three blocks in a row to recharge and make our adoptive abilities improving; it help students produce motivation from school and make them feel comfortable without pressure. But classes of art still need to be electives to choose which students own availability to take part in that class to make sure they don't waste time in the block they even aren't interested in.

9613CEAFE86E,""" Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"" Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? In my opinion i think we as people accomplish a lot if we are always doing something. One reason is because in oder to do something or succeed in something you have to be doing something for that to happen. I feel like if people want something to get done you have make a change and stay determined just like what Thomas Jefferson said in his quote and that's very important to keep in mind when you are trying to achieve something and you wanna make a difference.

In Thomas Jefferson's quote he says something that really makes you think about how in society today how people deal with some things. It makes you wonder if people are doing the most they can to accomplish something and it also makes you think to yourself if you as your own person are doing whatever is it you can to accomplish your goals in life. I feel like some people don't do anything to try to accomplish the set goals they have for themselves and they expect for that goal that they are waiting for to come to them instead of them working for that accomplishment. It shouldnt be that way but some people think life is like that also when there is a major issue going on in the world some people think that doing nothing is okay. When people witness a problem some people decide not to do anything and the issue will go away when maybe that's not the case in some situations.

There are people that are dedicated to what they want and will always do something to accomplish or achieve whatever it is they need to achieve and i think that is really good because it just shows that you are determined to do whatever you can to get what you want in life. People that are very determined achieve so much that it inspires others and makes them feel like they need to do something so they can start achieving want they want in life. I feel like that's very important because if you dont do something to accomplish what you want then nothing is going to happen in your life and I know there are people that don't do anything and they have nothing good going for them.

I feel like Thomas Jefferson was the type of person to stay determined and focused on the goals he wanted to make. He set goals and he made them happen he made things happen for our country and all that happend because he was determined and focused and he wanted to do something so he can accomplish what he wanted. Everything in life you have to work for it and do something about it. It doesnt just land in your lap everything you do requires you to work for it and the end result will be that you accomplished everything you worked hard for. For example I feel like a lot of issues in this world could be solved if people would do something people wouldnt be running for there lives because there is a war going on in there country if somebody would do something about it. There wouldnt be so much negativity and so much hatred if somebody would just make a change.

My over all conclusion about this quote that Thomas Jefferson wrote is that it is important for people to actually do something and work hard and achieve there goal. When you put your all into something your hard work pays off and you finally accomplished something and that's all that matters. I feel like what message Thomas Jefferson is trying to give is that life is always gonna be hard no matter what but you always have to push yourself and accomplish what needs to be done. When you do that good things come in return and it does serve purpose in you life it always have and always will. I think that is what Thomas Jefferson is trying to say in his motivating quote and it really inspired me and i hope it inspires others as well.                  ",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0

Would you like to be treated like a criminal for the rest of your life with nobody talking to you or respecting you? 62% of the people around the world are not being treated with kindness or respect. People in many countries like Canada, France, and Russia are not being like a human being. People should start treating others how they want to be treated, that includes being nice, kind, and helpful to each other.

In many countries people are not being treated right. 55% of the people have depression, loneliness, and sadness, because when they are not being treated with kindness they think no one likes or cares about them. Over 200 people around the world have committed suicide because they were not treated how they wanted to be treated. Not being kind or nice to others can cause damage to peoples feelings.

97167C9DC677,"Do people accomplish more if they are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose?. In activity does serve a purpose by showing maturity; however, people accomplish more if we are doing something. People accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence, it shows determination, and it shows progress towards their goals.

Firstly,people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence. In a everybody lives or in today's era, everyone wants to achieve greatness, but by achieving greatness people often or need to start from the bottom of their league or what I like to call ""THE CASTLE STANDARD"". In The Castle Standard each have their own class their, the bottom league is the beginner class, the middle is the amateur class, and the highest class is The Hall of Fame class AKA HOFC. Each person start from the bottom to get to the top, by starting from the bottom they can show higher authorities what they are capable off. For example, there was a movie called The Pursue of Happiness, the people in the movie was Will Smith and his son. The movie was about how a man, who worked at a business company as a mere employee, he and his son was kicked out of the apartment and they were homeless, they were trying to find a new home, so they started to live in a homeless shelter, but that didnt stop Will Smith from going to work. He went to work even though he was homeless. They authorities he worked with knew his situation, and they knew his dedication to his dedication to the company,so they decided to make him CEO of the company. In the end he got higher paid he was of the greatest CEO in the company and he was able to get a new house for him and his son. Furthermore people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence.

Secondly, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows determination. People often shows determination, once they set their mind doing something they personally want to achieve or accomplish. In people mindset have something they want like, saving up money to buy an expensive item or staying on task to get a promotion at your work place. Determination is also one of the characteristics of positive attitude that leads people a success in life. There also shows determination when they are trying to reach their goals in what they want to become in their future. For example, the movie I used in the first paragraph The Pursue of Happiness. Will smith even though he had a situation which he was homeless, he had job at the company and he was in a huge situation with the company. The situation was they wanted to fire him to give him time to set his life or plan his life with his son, since he was homeless and they are living in the homeless shelter. He showed determination to the job and gave them a huge reason why the should keep him at the company. because he solved the companies huge problem which almost led the company to bankrupt, so the authorities decided to keep him in the company and give him promotion and a huge check to be able to sustain his daily life with his son. I believe that people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows determination.

Lastly, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows progress towards their goals. In everyone life has goal, there is no human being in this Earth who doesnt have a goal. The goal can start from High school or middle school or somewhere were people have been brought out by their culture. In every goal there is a purpose why that person is setting that goal, maybe it could be huge reason like impressing your family or following your idol and so on, but by setting your goals people often need to plan how they can achieve that goal. For example, in TC Williams High School my goal is to join the Airforce, but by doing that I needed to take specific subjects that can help me or give me the experience towards my goal. I had to take Aerospace, JROTC, physics, and this was kind of personal ,but I had to take PE/Fitness for a physic body structure, so that I wont be weak,fat or plumply when I join the Airforce. So I had to take step by step or take my time to accomplish my goal. Furthermore, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows progress towards their goals.

In conclusion, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence, it shows determination, and it shows progress towards their goals. Also by stating you rmind on what you want to do people can make remarkable or impossible things that might shocked the world. I think the right thing to do is for people to accomplish more if they have set their mind on something extraordinary or even more enhance.    ",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5
9735E542665C,"Imagine having less day of school, students would be happy and could make their education simple. Some films have alredy adopted a four day work week, but they will work ten hours a day. Should school do the same thing by extending the school day and have four days of school? I believe that extending the school day and having four day of school could affect students by; getting them tired and they coud no longer in school.

To begin with, it has been said that students are tired in school because they have seven hours of school everyday . Imagine giving them nine hours of school, they could get tired quick and have stress. To illustrate, a student woke up at 6:30am to prepare to go to school, he will start the school at 8:00am and he will be finish at 5:00pm. After school the student will got home tired, he will jus eat dinner and go sleep. As you can see,

students could not have time to play and do their homework. If school extend the school day, students could be just tired all the time. in conclusion, students are not slaves, they need time to play and do their homework.

In addition, extending the school day for students and have four days of school for them, this could make them not going to school. Another example, imagine a high school student have to finish school at 5:00pm knowing kids nowadays they don't like school that much. This could be an obstacle for this high school student and he will decided to not going to school anymore because he will feel a long day of school. As you can see, students could be absent in school if they extend the school day, and this could be a big probem for the community and for the country.

Yet some people argue that extending the school day and having four day of school, could make the students more intelligent. It is tue that giving extended time to students and give them only four days of school, could make them smarter. But they will not longer like school because they will feel tired and they will not going to school anymore. And this could be a huge problem for students and schools

In conclusion, schools should not allow to have four days of school and extending two hours more because this could affect students by; getting them tired and they could not longer in school. Let's make students feel comfortable in school, but not make them feel slaves. Students needs time with friends and family. ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0
973A3ADFAB72,"My grandmother always says ''If you want to accomplish your goals you have to try different ways to get in the top of your objective.'' Back in my country Bolivia the mayority of old people said that you have to be resourceful if you want to get what you want. I am agree with this statement. In my opinion, I believe that people have to try to make something else to accomplish their goals because people don't trust themself, people don't take second chance, doesn't matter the time.

To begin with, most of people do not trust themself. There are people that think that can not do it, but they are wrong because if you propose something to yourself you have to work on it, you have to be a positive person if you want to persevere. You most have to trust in yourself. For example, my older brother never trust in himself, he always says what about if I do this and it no gonna work, he was negative, he always had negative thoughts, he never tries make something else to get on top of his goals or what he wants. But one day my grandma talked to him. My grandma told him that he has to try even though things are hard, if he want to accomplish his goals he had to try to make something else to achieve his goals.

Secondly, there are people that don't take second chance to get on top of their goals. The 60% of people when they have something done, they don't like the result so they don't want to do it again because they did ones so they don't want to do it twice, they think that they gonna get the same result. For instance, in my situation, I used to ignore the secod chance because I thought that if I did one time and it wasn't that great so is gonna be the same the second time, but I was wrong. Hence, it wasn't like that,so what I trying to say is that is essential to try, try, and try, ''My mom always says don't be scared to do it, the thing that are worth it isn't eassy you have to try and give your best.''

In addition, many people said you must have to try something else it doesn't matter the time. There are people that does't care how many time they try something, to get in their goals. The just think that they want to accomplish their dreams. For example, my best friend Generic_Name always says don't worry about the time you have to get what you want, you have to accomplish the things that you porpuse yourself take the advantage of the time.

To sum up, as you can see if you want to accomplish your goals you have to try different things. Just try keep in youjr mind that the ones who work in what they want they to achieve. Manyh people may think why people should try twice, but that's not the point. The point is that you have to keep going and try your best to get your goals.

First reason: healthier school lunch menu can be good for many students who does fitness and also for those who play in the school sports teams, they need to be healthier, for example soccer players needs to be with good weight, so they can play good in their games, but if they are eating things with a lot grease they would not be on the team, because they are not eating healthy.

Second reason: The change of the school lunch menu can also be good for those students who abuse eating at home, for that I think the healthier lunch menu can be a good idea, because they abuse eating bad thing at home but, they eat healthier at school, that is the second reason why I choose that the healthy lunch menu is a good idea, because the students are eating better than what they eat at their homes.

Third reason: This last reason is to show that the healthy food is better, because it helps students who are with any type of disease whether is a terminal disease or a normal disease, it doesn't matter what kind of disease can be,

it just that eating healthy help them for example, there are many student who are with diabetes sometimes they to bring their lunch from their home, because at school there nothing they can eat, because everything may have grease or sugar on it, and that is the reason why student bring their lunch, because of their disease, so that is why I think healthy food can a good option for the school lunch menu.

In conclusion, the healthier school lunch menu would be a good idea because it will help a lot students in many ways including teachers, students, and all the people who works a the school, I think is a good idea to be healthy not just out of school also inside of the school, we just want to maintain our habits, and that can be good because, we are doing the right thing, and that is my opinion about the school lunch menu, we just want to improve with the school and doing this we will.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0

Introduction:

We can see to simple nudes ayes when some people have the high enthusiams and we can detected if a person are sad, happy, when you talking or with yours expressions to the other people. The people who have enthusiams are the persons who ever have more people in the around whos can help them, so if they see a person sad, they go where him and they try to be happy him again or they asked you how they can help that person, but a person who doesn't have enthusiams they worry about to other people.

People who have enthusiams:

They can to do all whatever they wants, because they are happy.

They can create a grat ideas when they are happy in that moment.

They can help to other person who need help.

They can to be the best in everything.

They can to be happy to ther people who are tired or sad.

People who doesn't have enthusiams:

If you doesn't have enthusiams, you can not do anything.

How you can help to other person if you doesn't have your own enthusiams.

If your enthusiams is bad, don't be alone.

If you don't have enthusiams, you doesn't wants to do anything.

Do you agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success?

No, I'm not agree whith him because, if we failure and failure everytime again, so we enthusiams go to down, but if we failure just one time and the next time we are more preparate, is almost same that happen to me the day nobvemver 19, 2018,

that for see the hour from my phone, some people think that I did cheat in the SOL, but I doesn't need do that for pass this SOL.

Conclusion:

The bad enthusiams not just affect one person, that affect to the people who are in the around because if we can transmit cheerfulness to the other person and the other size the coin, other people can transmit the bad enthusiams I think so, so the person who have a good enthusiams they try to help to the other people. Winston Churchill with that he said, I understand that thing; That person whos failure and failure, are the person more strong because each failure they return more strongers and they do the best job.

99A3641592CA,"Do you think immagination is more important than knowledge? Why do you think it's important? Let's see why I think it's important! Well think about this you have the knowledge, but you never immagine things that you think you can't do. If you just immagine or think bigger about what you want or what you want to do. One day you will achive your goal or dream.

One of the reason why I think immagination is importantant is that if you don't immagine what you want to do in future as your job or hobby. When your in school your not going to try your best and show effort. If you don't learn anything at school when you are older to get a job, your not going to get the job you want, because wherever you are there will be someone that want the same job as you but trying harder than you, learning harder than you, and showing more effort than you. Which means effort creates achivements. For example, you went to an interview for a job at a store to be a cashier and there are 15 people that want to be cashier. But they only need one. So first they asked everyone what do you do when the costumer comes in. One of them said you have to smile and say hey, do you need help with anything? and you said you continue doing whatever your doing. Who do you think there going to pick? Of course the first one right? because she showed them effort and willing to do the job. That why you have to immagine what you want to do in future and try your best in school.

Second reason is that you have your knowledge, but if you don't immagine or think bigger your not going achive big things in your life. The people who failure in life are the people who quit something one step away from success. That's what a lot of people do. But the people who successed in life are the people who took the step that a lot people quit which the hardest step to take. For example, you want to start a company, but the people around you said that your not going to success. Although they said that you started a company anyways. After a month no one wanted to invest you company. You kept asking people to invest your company. So one person did, with that money you payed the bill. Then nothing happened to your company. But if you stop asking people when no one wanted to invest your company your company would of been closed. So you have to immagine thing and use your knowledge to achive them.

Third reason is you have to immagine things as your dream and get a lot of knowledge by learning at school. When I was little I wanted to become a docter when I grow up. Then I started immagining to help and more stuff. When I go to school. I told myself you have to be good at science, math and other subject to become a docter. So I will have knowledge about things that you have to know to become docter. so you have to get a lot of knowledge to achive the things you immagine.

So I think immagination is more important than knowledge. But knowledge is still really important. I feel like everything starts with immagination first. Then you go to school to get your knowledge increase every year. You work really hard to make immagination becomes reality.    ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0

Occupations Through Internship and shadowing to discover

Many schools have partnership with companies that allow students to explore certain occupations through internship and shadowing opportunities to discover. Many schools look for the best for you to graduate and to have the best paying job, like I think it's a great idea that the school let's them go out to discover many things that we don't even know and things we never even knew that it excited at all. Students this days don't even know what they want.

I would and will do it of convincing my principle of school to let kids to explore bunch of things like I said before like trying to take them to field trips for them to learn how to use credit cards and take them out to explore nature and study countries.

The oppurtunities to discover will take him to the highest of knowing what he will really want in his future and college for a fact that many kids don't take lead for being scared. Taking the biggest step ever to learn the new life becoming adults. You should never listen to people taking because they will want one thing and another you should think of what you really are passion of working without any complain.

I would convince my manager to take me many places so I will be clear and happy about it. Lets say principle or manager to lets explore new things like better paying wage job like that you won't be killing yourself.

That would help of us thinking if we learn something we love it we can even make our own business and will make lots of money. that will be a fact why asking your principle for many things of going out to explore bunch of things, like that you won't be worrying about money, paying stuff, and won't be dealing with bosses because I hate that they pressure you so much. If I ask to explore I would love to learn to read panels of when they build houses and buildings because they make a lot much money since their isn't much people to do that.

If your parents don't afford shouldn't be a problem if you have good grades you can earn scalerships to pay for them, You just worry about going out and finish high college of 4 years and enjoy it because you will definitely miss it after wards.  ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0

Having a good career after graduation is every students success. Most student are wondering when is the perfect time to start thinking of what career they should focus on, so should student commit to a career at a young age, or students should wait after graduation to commit to their career?

Students may have a lot of chances to learn about different careers, and different field of studies while they are waiting to chose what career to focus on before graduation; however, it is a great idea for students to commit to their career at a early age.

It is a great idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because student will know what type of courses are required for that particular career, students will not worried about what to do after graduation, and students will be able to develop some basic fundamentals skills needed for their future career.

Initially, it is a great idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students will know what type of courses are required for that particular career. As a student looking for a successful career it is always a great idea to stay on top of your academic purposes. Knowing your purpose make is easy for you to elevate, and push yourself to achieve your goals, it will be really easy for a students to finished their courses because they already know what they need, so all they have to do is display some effort, and confident in them self. For instance, a student may wants to get a major on computer engineer. some of the requirement needed for that are: Math, Science, some wide knowledge on Computer software, and Computer Hardware. By knowing all these will be a great advantage for that student. That would a great reason why student should commit to a career at a young age because it helps them know the requirement needed for that particular career.

Secondly, it is a great idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because student will not be worrying about what to do after graduation. As a student there is a lot going on in our personal life. Thinking everyday about what to do after graduation will be a stressful situation to be in. Knowing what to do before you graduate will not lead you to a stressful situation. An example, will be a student may have some family issues, and thinking of how to tackle those issues, so having to think about what to do after graduation without you knowing already will be really stressful. In that case I will say it is batter for students to commit to a career at a young age because students will not have to worry about what to do after graduation.

In addition, committing to a career at a young age is a great idea. because students will be able to develop some basic fundamentals skills needed for their future job or career. To get started with a career you may need to know basic skills that will help on the way, and I think it is a huge advantage for student to start practicing some of these skills before going to the actual field of work ( career ). For instance, an Internship Program. Student may be attending an internship class,

to develop some skills. Student that attended a internship class may feel one hundred present confident to display what they have learn during their Internship class to the outside world. More Importantly this will help students to get started after graduation. Fundamentals skills are essential for any jobs or careers, so for any student that have the chance to learn some fundamentals skills of a particular job or a career would be a great head start for that student. That is why it is a great idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because it will help students develop their some basic fundamentals skills needed for future career.

In conclusion, it is important for students to commit to a career at a young age because students will know what type of courses are required for that particular career, students will not be worrying about what to do after graduation, and students will be able to develop some basic fundamentals skills needed for their future career. For students to get a successful career students should always think ahead in terms of academic purpose. Knowing your purpose as a student is very important, and will always help students to be successful. As a final thought I would say knowing your major at a young age is very helpful, and it is an advantage for you as a student.                 ",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0

It is okay to look over the person you will meet because that way you are feeling sure with yourself about what this person can do or say about you.

Your personality is something that can define you as a human. If you want that people talk good about your personality when you meet them, you will have to give good impressions by doing things like saying hi when you arrive to some place, talk about the good things you have done, sports you play or any healthy activities you can achieve.

If you are a socialist person you know people will look at your personality when you meet them because they want to know if you are a pleasing person, the minds can change, imporessions never do, even if you know a person for a long period of time, you will never forgot how they was before you meet them for the simple fact that the first time is something that almost nobody can forget.

We meet new cultures by others student who are in our group. We start to learn know his culture and what they believe.

Meet new persons from others country's is good so that way we start to know more about the world.

We learn how to communicate with others person not only our language in others to. We start to talk with new person's. We start to share thing's from our culture and what like to do and our free times. We start work together and getting better by communicating. Communication is important for every one.

In groups we can help each other in projects or even in late work if we miss a day of class. Went there is a new person the group can help the new student with school stuff: where the next class is, where the cafeteria is,

where the buses stop, etc. Also be in a group helps to perform our skills for communicate and language. Be in a group also help to make work more easy because we help each other by putting ideas together. Groups are the best way to perform language speaking.

Making sure you have everything correctly, can help you in the future and you will learn a few skills that you might have not known about. Not everything has to be done perfectly, you could make a few mistakes and you could be fine with it. Some people like everything to be done perfectly well and done correctly, learning a few skills can make you have better achievement than others. Other's may not want everything be done well and say ""eh, good enough."" or say ""well, thats close enough.""

Everyone has different opinions and different thoughts. Most people are too lazy and don't want to check the checklist for writers, or just want it to be over, so they don't check and get things done incorrectly. Checklist for writers has everything a writer might need, like seeing if you have done your grammar correctly or if you use sentences in a great term, and use punctuation correctly.

Those few skills and make you a better writer and make you successful, editing is one the checklist for writers. Editing is important because you edit things and make it better by making it amusing or interesting. Editing something can be fun because you can get to add things, have plenty of more ideas. One of the important things besides using good grammar and spelling is making your message clear. People can get confused because they don't know what kind of message you're trying to give. People can misunderstand your message and you might get embarrassed because they couldnt understand your message. Thats why you need, well you don't need to, but its better if you do check and see if your message is done well.",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0
9C1A3F53B869,"Do you think that should be students finish high school in three years, enter college and get a job early? Some students, parents and teachers are agree with that the students finish the high school fast. I think the students should be finish high school in three years because, they will can graduate of the university more early, they will get a job fast and probably they will can do you're life better, to age early and be independents.

In this paper, I will argument that in my country El Salvador; The High school is of three years. My old sister was graduated of the high school at you're seventeen years old. she enter to the university and now she will graduate of nurse at you're twenty-one years old, however, I feel that is better that the high school should be of three years because, I'm in the high school and I will graduate at my nineteen years old. I think that, I will late to graduate for the university, more if I take a profession of eight years to studies.

In my school, the students, parents and teachers voted, to know how many are agree with that high school should be of three years. The 70% of the votes was the answers that yes, they are agree that the high school was three years. Some teachers says that, is a better way that the students will can have opportunity to graduate more fast, since that some students don't pass the class or the scholar years. They have the reason because, my brother don't pass the scholar years, now he need to repeat again the grade nine. He will take five years in the high school not four.

My mom was graduated too at you're seventeen years old in high school. When she was twenty-five years old, she graduated of doctor and then she got a good job in the hospital. In the same time she went to night school because, she want to be too heart's specialist and she was graduated again when she had 30 years and now she have two good job, have better life. I think that she can graduate early, because she only got three years en high school.

Three years in high school is better way to that the students can graduate early. Some school districts are disagree with that but, they are wrong because, the students will can have more fast a good job, if they going three years at high school. In the future I hope that the high schools will be of three years not four. ",3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.5

When you give someone advice, on what not to do or what to do, they won't take you serious because you're not following your own advice. They'll see you as if you're playing around if you do the opposite of what you told them. That's why a lot of people say ""Actions speak louder than words"". There's a difference on saying things, and actually doing them.

Therefore, there are people who knows you, and want to be like you. You never know if they can come up to you, out of nowhere and ask for opinions and advice. You can't just say anything, you can say something you do, and something you follow. Keep in mind that there's a lot of things people see in you. How you behave can change the way they see you too. Believe it or not, people actually see what you do. If you have siblings, they see your actions without you knowing, and they could do the same things. Giving advice to people is easy, but they would want to see you follow your own advice too.

There's people who you might not know, but they do know you and they act the way you do because of the way they've seen you behave around them or around other people.

Now lets talk about fire drills the best thing to do is not panic, you just got to act fast and think smart your main priorty is for you and your friends to get out the building safely. follow your teacher during the fire, cover your mouth with your shirt or sweater dont inhale the smoke thats how you pass out from the smoke.

9DBCBFD45366,"Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices because they can get different perspective from other people, more option to choose from, and other ways to solve problem. Things can go really bad sometimes if someone doesn't ask for more than one option to choose from.

First of all, getting different perspective from other people is anther reason for someone to ask for multiple opinions. Let's say Generic_Name was going to the mall, but when she got there she didn't know where this on store that she really wanted to go was. She asked a dude where it was and the dude said "" In the second floor"". She went to the second floor and did not find the store so she asked another person and other person said ""It's on the first floor next to the ice cream shop"". She went down to the first floor and went next to the ice cream shop got an ice cream and found the store. Generic_Name was so happy she found that store because if she had it asked the other person she would never had found the store.

Second of all, having more than one opinion is better right?. For example lets say Generic_Name moved to New York and it was her first day of high school, she had know clue where her school was nether her parents. Generic_Name parents told her to just walk to school and see where other students where going. She saw this girl with blue eyes and brown hair, "" ""She looks like a high school"" Generic_Name said, so she ran up to the girl and asked ""Hey what's your name"" Generic_Name she said I'm in high school what about you"" ""Oh same"" Generic_Name said. When they got in the school Generic_Name had to go in a complete different way and Generic_Name was complete lost again. However, While Generic_Name was walking in the hallway she was asking a bunch of people to see where she had to go. She got multiple answers saying to go to the same place. See asking multiple opinion is better than one because what happen if she only had asked one person they could had been room and she could had gone to the wrong room.

Lastly,

Another reason why seeking multiple opinion is good, is because it can solve problems. For example, Generic_Name was having a sleepover with two friends. They were making food in the kitchen when her mom told her not to. While they were having fun cooking the oven caught on fire. Generic_Name was finking out she didnt know what to do ""AHHHHHH WHAT SHOULD I DO"" she said freaking out. One of her friends said call 911 while on the other hand her other find told her just trow water it will be fine your so dramatic. Generic_Name decide that calling 911 was the smartest or lets say better idea. 911 came and solved the problem.

Overall, seeking multiple options can help someone make better choice by getting different perspective from other people, more options to chose from and can solve problems. Generic_Name found the mall she had to find, she found the place had to go and her house didnt burn down. Let's just say somethings really bad could had happen if Generic_Name didnt ask for more than one opinion.",4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
9DCB91B1F18D,"I think that students should take a art, muisc, and drama class. Cause by taking these classes they can learn more about what happens ineach classes. Also, if they do one of those classes they can recive credits on their GPA.

First reasoon, student can learn what happens in that class like art. Art is a great elective class because tehy can have more credits and they can learn more interesting things in that class. Also, art can do things for the student because while time pass and they are great in drawing it could take him or her to collage it could make better digree collage. For example, if you also can be in a art contest in your school or anywhere else.

Secondly, students can do these classes. However, music is also a great elective class because it could help you like in school and anywhere else because they know how you sing. But, music is not only singing students can also play insterment like giutar, flut and many more. So, student can also impress them with insterment. Also, it helps with credits by it could take them to a different better collage.

Lastly, these classes are better to take as an elective class because they can perform in events in school like drama. Drama is a great elective class because students get to move around and have fun and dance. Also, they can do it on their free time and as their elective class. For example, students can impress their family with their amzaning talent. Also, with their talent they can go to different countriesand perform their and other places too and preform too.

In clousion, this is why students should take art, music, drama as their elective class. That ways they can get credits for doing these classes.

9E2645222231,"Although some says that inactivity serve a purpose, because the can get more time to them selves then when they are in activities, actually determine never to be idle, because we can accomplish many things; If we are always doing somethings such as involving in activities, having more time with our book, and trying out new things.

It had been writing by Thomas Jefferson "" Determine never to be idle "". It is very true that some many people and students are always idle; they don't use their time wisely. We can do a lot if we involved our selves in activities instead of been idle; for example, when I came to the United States in January 8,2017. I was sitting at home for two months without going to school, and doing nothing. I got tired of been idle, so I told my mother that I wanted to something instead of been idle. I wanted to sign up for the Generic_City Soccer Team, so that I can get busy with my time, and use it wisely. I finally signed up for the Generic_City Soccer Team, and I got accepted by the coach. I started training with new people, and I made a lot of friends.

Instead of been idle, why can't we spend more time with our books? The more we go close to our books the more we learn faster, and increase our skills in reading; for example, my friend Generic_Name, his parents never wanted him to hang out with friends that much, or neither been idle without having his book to read. Generic_Name kept on spending most of his time reading his books for a long time, and he became a good reader in his English classroom. The teacher always asked him to read out story books and passages to his classmates in school. He inspired many students in his school, and most students wanted to be like him, so they started having more time with their books at home.

In addition, people who wanted to be idle, or people who think inactivity serve a purpose are people who are not determine, and not planing on their future; they don't want to involve in activities, or interact with people. Idle people are lazy, because they don't want to try out new things. try out new things when ever you are idle. You can learn a lot even if you are not perfect; for example, me and my three friends Generic_Name, Generic_Name and Generic_Name. We were sitting at home idly doing nothing; until when Generic_Name suggested that we should go and try out the UFC GYM. We went there, and signed up for the training; they gave us a one day trail to see if we would like the training. We went there the next day and started training for one hour; after training I told my friends that I don't like the training, because it was gave me back pains, so I quit the gym, and my three stayed in the training, because they like it. I was not perfect, but I tired out a new thing and I got some experiences from it.

As a result of all the reasons and examples. I encourage every idle human and people who thinks inactivity server a purpose to get engage in activities, having more time with their books, and trying out new things when ever they feel like they are idle. You can do a lot if you try out new things. We can accomplish more if we are always doing somethings; therefore, determine never to be idle.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0

I belive that students should be require to take these clases because it plays a great rolls in our lives. students should take these clases because they're part of our daily activity. Some students are really good at arts, and some are good at music, while the others are good at drama. So such clases should be allowed in schools for students to take.

I also agree with those that says that students should be required to take clases like art, music, and drama because some students wants to become an artistic, some wants to become a musician, while the others want to be a dramatist, so it should be allowed in school for students to take them. I believe that through arts and music, or even a drama, people are able to express their emotional feelings, or their passed lives. As for me music and art should really be allowed in schools because through those subjects people will be able to express their grievances.

Some people may say these clases should not be require for students to take and such clases should be electives because not evryone are good at them.

Well it's true, but these clases are really helpful to the society because not everyone have the face or the abilies to really express their emotional feelings to peolpe, however, people have their passed life stories to tell, but they don't know how to let them out. Probaly through arts, music, or even drama they'll be able to express them out to the world. Through this subjects many people are rich today, and many people was able to let what had been in them for years upon years out, so they should be required for students.

For instance: Beyounce, Rehanna, Nici and so on. I believe those people didn't just come up to become rich today they study music because that was their goals in life.

Second, is that the tecnology can do part of the work, for example you are writing a note for a paty, ceremony, marry, whatever, and it have to be one for each person, what are you woing to do? just by using the technnology you can print evrithing you want, it makes easy your work, also have more time to do something else.

Third, some benefits of the technology is the time that you spent looking for sonthing or deciding, another benfit is the things that you can learn with all the information that is in the web, ofcourse if you use it properly like it is.

In addition, sometimes people get addicted in a web and that could be bad, that is when the negative effecs came, people don't know what they are doing when they get adicted to it, that is why people have to know how to use it correctly

A lot of people are going to defenetly critisize your traits and tell you that you are not good at this and that. Therefore you are responsible to succeed in life by doing the right things and using the right traits. For example if someone else comes and tells that you are not good at your job and you know you are doing good and everyone tells that you are doing awesome. And you are strong and cofident at what you do then you are good.

In the other hand people think that traits are formed by influences or beyond our control. But influence comes from our own family. For example our ancestor could have done the things that our dad or mom are wanting us to be doing. Therefore our traits are every good because our dad and mom already did the traits that our ancester thought them. Fortheremore we are getting strong and have the capacity to teach others about what traits are all about.

As a result the younger genaration is learning about a trait really is. Traits really means a lotin life becuase a trait definetly describes how your personality really is and what you are really good at. For example if you are good at playing soccer thats a persona trait. Sometimes it takes a long time to learn what really your traits are. But if you now you are good at something show the world who you really.

Our character traits are more important than we realise beacause it defines how you are. In addition our traits is what gets you a real job or a habbit that you have. Also character traits are you being smart you acting or doing other things. For example helping your brother or your friends at school is a trait because you now the topic and they dont.

A0BC5780C987,"Going outside can provide fun and enjoyable things to do for example going to the park with friend or people that you enjoy being around with, playing a sport, riding a bike, riding a scooter, and lastly a way you can spend time outside if you don't want to be so active is just walking around the neighborhood either with yourself or with a friend.

Going to the park with friends or people you like surrounding yourself with is fun and enjoyable because you guys can make up a game or play a game and play in different teams and see which team wins first. Playing with some of the park equipment is another way to have fun for example the swings to see who can go the farthest upwards, the slide maybe you guys can time yourself to see who goes down the slide the fastest, or the monkey bars to see who can get across the set of bars quicker or who can hold themselves on the bars the longest. A little of a made up game my sister and I played when we were younger was obstacle course so what I would do is tell my sister that the floor was an ocean filled with hungry sharks and that would make the game more intense because at the time we were very scared of sharks and so if one of us fell of the monkey bars or rope the other would have to start chasing the person who fell until the person who fell gets to their ""safe spot"" which the safe spot would have to be far.

Another thing you can do outside is play a sport, ride a bike or ride a scooter. Playing volleyball, soccer and basketball are my favorite sports not only because it's fun but it's very competitive and that always gives me so much energy and having energy just makes the game better because it makes both the competitors competitive since the boost of energy makes them tensed and careful to make sure they don't mess up so they watch the competitor like a hawk. If playing a sport is boring and not interesting to someone, riding a bike or a scooter is an option. Riding them is exciting and fun. Riding a bike or a scooter around a park is relaxing if your just calmly passing through but if your racing with someone or yourself then it's fun so both ways is enjoyable to a person. If I go out to bike or scooter I'm with either a friend or a family member because we like to bike or scooter next to each other and just talk or race to see who's faster and better at doing biking or riding a scooter.

If going to the park or playing a sport doesn't interest you and you just rather do something calming and relaxing then going on a walk, run or laying outside with a blanket on the ground and watching the clouds go by is an option for you. If you're with someone and you guys want to run then you guys can calmly jog next to each other or have a small conversation while running or run and just be next to each other for support and comfort. If you're walking just with yourself then you can breathe, think, or just look at your surrounding look at the trees, houses if they're any near by, or the flowers. Laying out a blanket on the ground and staring at the sky is enjoyable to some people because watching the sky and how the clouds move is angelic and peaceful to them, so if you're wanting to do something that includes being outside and you don't want to do anything then walking, running. and sky watching is for you. Laying out a blanket and watching the clouds go by is probably one of my favorite things to do just because it's very relaxing to me, distracts my busy mind, and I find clouds beautiful so watching something that gives me peace to me makes me happy mentally and physically.

Going to the park, playing a sport, going on a walk, or a run is some of the things you can do outside and enjoy and have fun. Being outside is important because Vitamin D if it's low then a way you can raise it up is going outside because the sun is apart of vitamin D so not only going out is good for you physically but it can also be good for you mentally.

would picked art because you can do anything you want with it. The reason I

picked art was because a long time ago I would be sad or mad. So I went to the consular and she told me

I can use art. And how will

I use it? I would color what i felt and i would take my anger out its like telling someone what you feel except your drawing it.

My secound reason is its not always about drawing you can also the other things with it. You can gather resources and you can build things with that. For example if you had feather and bottles or cans you build a bird out of it. And even just painting something like a wall with difrernt kinds of color thats art.

Also it can be soothing because when you have a lot of tress you can paint. Because whe you paint and your trying to paint the beach it relaxing. For meits relaxing because whe you start to paint the brush won't be hard like a pencil it will just go by so soft you won't have to worry about messing up.

It's also great becauseyou get to learn about artist. Because it will kinda help you. Because it can tell you about how they draw or paint they can have a special way doing it. Like I read artist that used dots to paint and draw I thought that was enterested so i tryed it was kinda of hard. But I enjoyed trying it.

Most people think its best for kids to be in school than in their homes because it can help them in their social life, make friends in there world instead of being lonely. Even though lots of students like to work at home, I strongly believe its better to work at schools.

Students should have friends in there lives to be more social in the world. When I was younger I use to switch schools to schools then I went to a school called Generic_School I was the only new kid in school I had no friends I was the quite in class, then one day I join a club called book club we just read books and talked about what happen in them. Then one of the kids came up to me and ask what do you like I told him what I love like animals, sports. Those were the things we both like too he was my first friend in that school. Students should be in schools because they should be comfortable when meeting, talking with other students because they might have things in common.

At school students can help each other out in class if they dont understand something. For example, In history there are students that don't understand they would just sit in their seats and not ask for help. One day I saw a student frustrated with work so I decided to help him in America Civil War. When we took our test we both got A's. In my class students can be helped by fellow classmate or the teacher.

During school projects students can be in partners or in groups to get a good grade. In my science class we have projects to do we get in a group of friends to get a good grade and we see a student work by him self. When we got our projects back we got an A and the student got a B. This shows that in schools we should be with other students to bring in ideas, ways that others can't see.

In school you can be well taught and understand better when people like teachers, or other students help them. Its best for students to be in school rather than be home school.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5
A263E403FAC3,"it's a gtood idea for us the students, like that we could know what we want to study when we be graduated from the high school. we have a lot of time to think about it. I would like to study for pilot, so i can try to choose one class to be related about that and learn about how to drive an airplane.

But, Not all the schools has these benefits and also because some students don't have how to go to these schools and all of us students do not can go to any high school. I think that's the only bad thing because if you drive, you just can go and then back your home and some times if someone is giving to you ride is good as well but it's not gonna be every time then you would have to find who can take you to school and who can pick you up from the school.

Well I think we the student to commit to a career at a young age is well because we can be graduated more early.

the good news is if you go to thats schools you can learn more and choose what do you wanna study for college thats a good point and also you may have a lot of opportunities, In some high schools you needed have good grade for going there and passing clases too.

in others words if you don't have a good grades you can't sign for that schools.

A28E9B475935,"My mother always said, ""You will never learn if you stay at home, go to school to learn more things."" Math, English, history, and science are some classes that students need to learn. If students take classes from home, then student will not learn so they will not benefit from it. Students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because student will gain less exercise, students will get less social communication, and student will be less focus.

Many claim, students will benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because they will feel more comparable. However,students will not learn anything even if they feel more comparable at home. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home.

To begin, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will gain less exercise. For example, Generic_Name, who attend classes at home before, said that he will get less exercise, now that he goes to school he gets more exercise than before. To further detail, two friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, both attend classes at home before, they would both say that they would gain very little exercise before going to school. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will gain less exercise.

Additionally,students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will get less social communication. For example,

Generic_Name, a girl who use to attend classes at home, would not communicate much with other students at first, after some time she is able to communicate with other students. To further detail, Generic_Name, would talk very little to other students because he use to take classes at home, after a while he would talk to other students. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will get less social communication.

Lastly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because student will be less focus. For example, Generic_Name ,a student who attend classes at home, had to difficult time focusing on the lesson at home, some later she began to understand the lessons. To further detail, Generic_Name had a terrible time focusing on the lessons when he toke classes home, he said that his surrounding was very distracting. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes from at because student will be less focus.

To concluded, student will gain less exercise, have less communication experience, and will be less focus on lessons are reasons why students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home. These three argument state why students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes from home. If students attend classes at home then student will not learn a home. There is one option: students should not attend classes at home.",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5

""Life in high school"". In high school to ca be graduate and learn how the new life is in here, and learn a lot of things to adapted or to fit to the new language and the new people what did I say new here is another world, new people new language that is why I'm here, I came from to my native country. To learn English and speak like a normal person like I speak Spanish, speak bout same without of problems. I'm going to take position on myself to spoken in this introduction, things did i most enjoy in high school is having the opportunity to study here in the United State. And also learn a new language I'm so thanks full for all those opportunities.

All of the things did happen on my life was not easy, and also I remember when my cousin speak English like a normal language and he also came from where came from and i remember did i said i want to spoke like you i was so impressed and how he can speak English like a normal person here in the U.S, because in that time I did not any English at all. When was my time to get in high school begin all this things did i was want for a long time. first day I was so nerviest but at the same time exerted because I came in with my mind in what I'm want and what I love was and is learn English and spoke like normal.

Generic_School give the opportunity at the students graduate on three years, except at the normal traditional four, let me tell you why I take three years except at the normal four cause my age I'm almost getting on (21) at the date to graduate for example, if I'm taking the four years of high school when the people have more then 21, they kicking you off the school

I thing was I good idea taking just the three years to can be graduate on time.

In addition all what has to happen to can be graduate is taking all of the classes did I need it to get the credits. making or taking classes on summer school maybe night school to graduate on time is hard process to graduate in three year but helps a lot to the people who work after school or another thing that probably they has to do, to graduate without credits missing. And here I am in my last year of high school I'm a senior I feel good can be say this is my last year here and all this help me for the program what they made for us to graduate in three years that helps me at all.

In conclusion; I enjoy the must time in high school I know was and is a big way to run was not easy but also no difficult when we want just put in your mind what you want and if you want you can this is my lemma don't give up at the last moment we can cause if you want you can nothing is impossible in this life don't lust the time because the time is like gold I know all this no to much relate about the prompt but I'm know did I doing well believe in yourself. one of the things did I'm thinking about what I going to do after school is going directly at collage don't lust the time did I win.

A366CC7B0D05,"Are first impressions impossible to change? No, I believe that first impressions are not impossible to change because when you typically meet someone for the first time many people just try to "" fit in "" or be someone who they really aren't but within time the perspective of how you are viewed can be changed and the first impression you made of yourself the first time won't matter. Also, when you first meet someone , typically you are nerves and you can be seen as a quiet and closed person when in reality you are really outgoing but it just takes you time to adapt to someone and many people don't act like themselfs.

A example of why I disagree with ""first impressions being hard to change"" is because the first time I met my boyfriends mom I was really shy and nerves and I thought was giving off a bad vibe and making myself look "" bored "" even though I was just trying to be careful and not seem so crazy with what I said or did. After a while of me being around her she started to see me as a different person/much better person than i was and she started to see how outgoing I was and how I was nothing like the first impression I gave her and her view of me changed.

Another example I have of how first impression can be changed is the from the first time i met one of my best friends. I first met her through a mutual friend we both had and when we got introduced to each other i thought she was annoying and that she could never be serious but with the time that went by I started to see how she really was and that was her personality and maybe i judged to fast. So when we started to become closer friends my first impression of her changed because now i love her and the first impression of her didn't affect me after all.

So in conclusion , no , I don't think first impressions are almost hard to change. But it is also not something that can be changed within hours but with time the impression you give off can definitely be changed for the better or for the worse based on your actions as well.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5
A3C8FABB8B29,"I think is a good, idea that students get different types of classes because that might help to choose their career. Its a really good idea knowing what you going to do with your life once you're done with high school. There are so many teens that once they are out high school they don't know what jobs they want to start and study for it. I think that thats why they should have many more classes that thats what its going to help them continue with their thinking of what career to choose once they gradute high school. for example classes that are for automotive technology is a confortable job in a way that you learn more about cars but in a way is dangerous at the same time because cars have so many heavy parts that could injured you. Another confortable job is being a lowyer lowyers don't do much other than being in the computer or doing paperwork in that cause you dont have to be outside in the cold working on a bad job that involves working in a construction site. And thats the main idea that schools should offer carrer choices that involves students in a carreer class that will teach them once they are out school and that the jobs will interest the students. There is so many students that drop out school because is not interesting to them but thats a bad idea of not going to school because if a student doesn't graduate they will be workingfor some restaurant not earning that much money and working so many hours thats why it is important for teens to stay in school so that the school could offer them on what job they will choose once they graduate high school. School is one of the most important places where they will teach students what decisions they should take on their life once they are adults. In some cases students start going to college once they are out school because they got an idea of how their class works and what for what job they are going to study.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
A43F5C97F2E2,"A lot of a good workers are doing all their best to find new jobs and a believing future for themselves , most of them are responsible and confident that they can do anything to make the work up and even more better than it before , but they usually don't find it because they don't have experiences and these employers don't want to hire them just because of that .

Although, a lot of people may argue that employees may need experience to find jobs but actually none of that is right .There's a lot of people that found jobs and succeed without experience , you just have to keep believing and never give up. My father didn't found a job too and he is mom was sick and he had me as his son so young . He had no experience in any domain and he needed a job pretty badly to pay the rent and grandma's surgery . But he tried again and again and he never gave up and now he is one of the most famous journalists in Morocco without any experience and still better then the one that do have experiences.

First of all ,an employee doesn't need experience to find a job , he just need to be loyal to his job and work hard and be such an honest person to make his work go even higher and help spread love and respect at his job to all the people .

Second , it's not necessarily that it has to do with jobs obviously ; it can be acting or sports or anything you want to do .You don't certainly need to have experience to do it just like Mohamed Ali said :'Everyone start out as a beginner "", but in term of jobs you just have to show your employers how much you deserve this job and that you can be a better candidate to hire . But you need to prepare for it thought because you don't want to look like a person that can not bring the job up and that you don't know anything about it. My father told me that mostly the workers that don't have experiences are the ones that work hard and always bring ideas that push the job even higher and they usually have positive attitude and a positive vibe that makes the boss love them more then the other employees.

Third, I don't know why all these employers don't give a chance to the employees just to see what they can do , there's a lot of people that didn't even got a chance to show their work , even thought they can be the best at it .I have a french friend that wanted to be a teacher assistant for a french class here in the United States of America , but all the schools didn't accept her as a teacher because she didn't had much experience in teaching and that is just not fair .She is french and she can teach better because she is from the country where the language is coming from and that's how the students will learn pretty easily , that's why I believe that the employers should change their opinion about the experiences.

Finally , It really doesn't matter if you don't have experiences because if you believe in your self it means that you can get any job you want , just keep the hard work and all these employers that still think that experience is necessary will regret it after because they will see you at the top . For me , experience have nothing to do with jobs everything depends on the work you're going to do and not the work you have done , and I'm pretty sure that the persons with no experience will rock it more than the ones that do have experiences and just keep in your mind the positive energy and you'll make it just like my father did and my french friend did .",3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5
A484FD45778A,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. How would this affect students? this can affect students because they can get distracted by video games or phones. The problem is that some students get online classes but they just want to sleep more and than they don't do the online classes work or they play video games. this is why this is a bad idea.

first, one reason of why online classes will affect students is the distraction, for example they can get distracted by video games very easily by a friend calling them to ask if he want play, or by get bored get the phone and see they instagram.

to continue, the second reason is because they get sleeping to late at night and wake up to late, for example they can get sleeping late at night watching TV or playing video games with they friends. Some might says that online classes can be beneficial for students, but they don't know if the students are really working in they online classes because the distractions of video game or phones.

So the problem are some students who only want the easy way for everything include school.

the online classes are a bad idea because the distractions like video, phones, no sleep during night, or instagram.

A495DAE52B0E,"There is two ways of working at school, one is to work alone another is to work in groups. Many people choose to work alone because it more quiet, the grade they get on the activity only affect themselves and not other people, and not distracted from other people around them. but i prefer working in groups to be with friends, get things done more faster, and more fun.

Working in groups is a advantage because the people on your group can help you in many ways like to know something you dont understand, or when you need help they can help you in what you are straggling in. in one occasion when i came to the united states i was at school and that day our teacher told us that we have to do a project and she gave us the option to work alone or to work in groups, so in that time i was a little scared and afraid to talk to people since i didn't know any English and i also was scared of people to not be able to understand me because i did not know any English i knew some words but not a lot, but a girl name Generic_Name came to ask me if i wanted to work with her and her friend, and i said yes, it was a lot of help working with them because i didn't understand anything the teacher asked us to do and what the project was about but they help me a lot to understand everything and to learn a little more English and to develop my self.

Working with other people it more easy than working by yourself. people can get things more faster, and more good because more people more ideas. Getting things more faster is beneficial, teachers can give students extra credit in their activity or project. Also students would be able to know how to work in groups in their future job, to make friends, to become more independent, and to be nice. working with other people would get people to know how other people feel and to get to know more people to become friends. My first day of school i was afraid to not make any friends because i'm not a social person, but them i become friends with a girl name Generic_Name because of a project i was doing with her, and since that day i'm still friends with her.

One of the reasons why people like to work in groups is because a lot of people are really nice in many ways. working in groups is a better idea than working alone because when people work in groups they get more social and to be able to know and to conjugate with other people. Being nice to other people it help you to make friends and not getting people mad at yourself or dislike yourself and to make things fun and good. when i turn 16 i started working at a restaurant called Generic_Name i was a little scared because it was going to be my first job i didn't know how things were. but when i started i have to be nice to costumers since i was working on the line. but one day i was sad and mad at someone about something they said, but that day i was working in a project with some people and they started to be nice to me and make me laugh so my day can get better so the reason here is that working in groups can be a lot of beneficial because that day it was a really busy day at my job but because of the people on the group i was working with, they made my bad day to a good day.

Working in groups is a lot more beneficial than working alone because people can get things done more faster, make new friends, and more fun. i really hope our teachers can give us more opportunities to work in groups than to work and do everything alone because it really help a lot of people to become social and more independent and to develop themselves.

A4A90A401002,"People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas.

This is reasonable for each individual, and people should make their own decisions in life. We always ran into problems and sometimes we need to make decisions on our own.

When we have the choice and decide to make the differences, it's important to follow our instincts and we have to take the responsibility to make the good choice. This is how we learn by ourselves.

In our daily life, people always ran into problems and get stressed out, for example, the car broke down in the middle of the traffic, failing the test that you've been studying for weeks, your boss fired me today...

However, it is our choice to make the right decision and to change it; you could call for help from someone, you can study harder or ask others to help on the school work, and also look into other jobs that you are interested in.

There are so many options for everyone to pick and to follow our own instincts and ideas to make everything better.

As an adult, soon after high school I will be joining navy and have my own life, to do everything by myself.

Everything around me will change completely,I will not have my parents standing beside me to teach me common sense, nor my teachers to teach me about life lessons, nor any of my friends to be there and help me out, this is all about me and my decision to make.

If I'm going to learn the hard way, I will have to learn the hard way.

Maybe my instincts kick in and help me out, you never know.

Making your own judgment is one of the most important survival skills we will have to learn in life, everyone will grow up one day, to have your own family and all the responsibilities, now you are the one who have to decide everything, to have responsibility for not only yourself but you family as well.

Instincts will tell you which way your heart goes, and sometimes it might leads you to the wrong path, but don't worry, this is how we are going to learn.

Success is not an easy path, it's full of adventure and false on the way to finish.

You will experience more fail than you can ever imagine before you achieve the goal, to success it all by yourself is to follow your instincts and ideas.

You may have concerns that what if you seek guidance for experts and authorities about life's important matters?

Guess what, life is full of adventure, you never going to know what is coming next and not everyone's life is going to be the same, so therefore seek guidance for experts may work for some people, not all, you may have found a different solution for yourself.

All we can do is listen what others advises are, Because you will be the one who make the final decision, and you are responsible to your decision, not anybody's advice or common.

Everything is on you and to follow your heart to make things right, or to learn how to judge then choose the right path.

No one will change your life unless you let it happen, no one can change your final decision unless you don't follow your instincts and heart.

This is why we should make our own decisions, not only to make things right, but also follow your heart and to understand about life's important matters.",3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0
A4BBB301E3CE,"I agree with what Winston Churchill said because it is true. Going form failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm can help be successful in the end because you tried and tried again and it gave you more confidence to go on and try things you haven't done before. When we fail we learn from our mistakes and try again and be successful because failure is actually helping you in the pursuit of success.

On the pursuit of success we will have some hard times ahead of us, and does hard time are the mistakes we will end up making and form does mistakes comes success. For some people when they try new things the only get it once without any mistakes. But for other people it takes the a few times before they can get it, that is going from failure to failure. Failure helps thousands of people become successful in life.

When you are trying something new, you have to happy about it, and when you fail doing that new thing you should still be happy because it is your first time doing it, and when you fail you always get a second chance to do it again, and when you fail the second time you get another chance, it will keep going until you get it at the end and giving up is not an option. You should always be happy about trying new things. And when you try new thing and you fail and you give up strait away you, are not being successful, you are just ruining your life an becoming a failure because you gave up strait away. Once again giving up is not an option in the book of life. Giving up ruins your life.

In life there will be challenges coming your way and you should take those challenges head on and if you fail try again and be successful, because out of those challenges comes a great price that takes you to the next level. Going to the next level is a big thing in life good things start coming your way and more people start to like you because of the challenges you went through and failing helped you become successful at the end of those challenges.

A643E3470F54,"No,I don't think the school board should add a extra hour to school each day. My reasoning is because If you put this in a students perspective,they have to wake up 5 or 6 am in the morning to get ready for school,stay there for 9 hours and come home to do homework.

You can't even imagine coming home a hour and a half later trying to get homework done. If the less time students are home,the less time they have to complete homework or assignments. I also want to point out If students are trying to get more homework done,the less sleep they're getting and If kids come to school the next day,they won't get the information they need for their classes because they're tired.

Students will start to fail in school because of no sleep and this time in won't be there fault for their sleep management. This time it will be the school boards fault for adding stress to these children and why they're not getting enough sleep. I'm not saying it's impossible for student to come home an hour and a half late and still get their sleep,but If they have homework and they spend there day focused on it it's likely students won't get good sleep. Reasons like these are why some students can't graduate from high school.

To rap this up I say that the main reason why I don't think it a smart idea for the school board to ad a extra hour and a half to school because, more students time management of doing homework and getting sleep would likely fail in succeeding in school for present and future. I hope the school boards read this and take time to considerate this idea that would just give another reason for students to fail in the future.",3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.5,3.0

Not all people can think it can be true because you can do something wrong and get in trouble for it. You can keep doing the same problem and not care for it.

You can choose what your problem's are. You don't need to have a problem to do your best. You can be good at something and not have a problem with it. Some problems are good because you learn from what's good and bad. If you do something that's wrong it's ok. Because doing the right thing can be hard for people to do. Much of the time theirs something you can't do about it.

People choose to take the wrong path for their life and some don't. The ones who take the wrong path will go though a lot trouble. They would have a lot of problem's that they can't change but just cause you that path doesn't mean you change it. Even the ones who are living good doesn't mean their not going though some problems because everyone does.

An example to a problem is that you have a scholarship to a great university that is far away, but your family needs you to stay close and help them. Some things may seem impossible to fix but hard times bring the best out of you, you'll try hard to fix it. There are both big and small problems but a problem is a problem you can't prevent them from happening. You learn from your mistakes to do better and you always try what's best for you , it may lead to a better path, as Duke Ellington said ""a problem is a chance for you to do your best.""

Problems happen to everyone, the real deal comes to how you will respond to it. Many people take their time when they deal with something troubling, they all have their different strategies too. They all have one thing in common they do what they think is best for them. They try to see if it will help them and what they could use to an advantage to be better. you would never do something to hurt yourself on purpose, you will need to think things through to see the outcome. Sometimes things do not turn out how you want to be, and you learn more about the things you will do to make things easier.

There are times that problems involve more than one person, and won't effect you only but others as well. It can be friends, or family, it could even involve people you don't know.

An example is that you got a great scholarship to the university of your dreams, but your family doesn't want you going far away and need your help. your education is at risk, but your family needs your help. You'll have to see what outcome there is to both of the situations and what is better for your future. Not all problems have an easy choice but they bring out the best in you and help will help you in some way, they build your character.

Some problems may seem impossible to fix but hard times bring the best out of you, and you'll try to fix it. There are problems that make it seem that you can't handle it alone. There are people that can help you, you're never alone. Even if you try your best it may not be how you want it to be, there are others who will help guide you, to have a good outcome. All you need to do is stay focus and look forward, so that you can keep your head up. You never have to do anything alone, you might need the help of others and it's okay to do so.

There are both big and small problems but a problem is a problem you can't prevent them from happening. It happens to the best people and there is no way to stop problems from coming. It doesn't matter the size of a problem, you should never underestimate them. You have to try your best when a problem presents, sometimes what seems right can turn out very wrong. You need to think if others will be effected, you can't just ignore a problem sometimes it could become bigger. It is also a chance that you could show others that you know what you are doing, after analyzing a problem you do what is best.

You learn from your mistakes to do better and you always try what's best for you, it may lead to a better path, as Duke Ellington said ""a problem is a chance for you to do your best.""

No matter what you should always try your best, not only when a problem comes up. We should show our best when problems come up due to the fact that sometimes there are problems that can put you in danger or hurt you. You can't prevent problems from happening but you can have less you you do things correct the first time around.

It would really benefit the students, who are not socialize and have problems contacting with other students or teachers. Every students grew up differently, and also some other students have had a bad childhood experienced and it reflected on how they act in their current life, by giving them a chance to study where they are comfortable at would give them a chance to show what they can really do, because not many students have that many option or chances to show their full potential. They can not do that by having to stay in school, and force them selves to socialize to other students or teachers it would all just be a distraction.

Also, it would help the students who had a bad experienced at school. Students who experienced getting bullied at school can caused them to stop going or the will to study and be successful in life. Bullying even nowadays still have so much impact on why some schools are really not on their high standards. And it showed that students are highly affected by it. It showed that it is a nightmare to some students, but now having the online classes will pull them away from that and really focused on their studies.

Furthermore, students who are in their comfort zone, will likely be able to focused and not have any distraction.

Students who is really serious about being successful and have that high standards are more likely to be successful. Family can also motivate them, to keep on pushing even though it might be hard for them but having your family by your side can really motivate you to keep on pushing.

Therefore, i really believed that, students should really have the option to take online classes or video conferencing. by just having that it would benefit lots of student, who are having problems being socialize to other students or teachers. it would help the students who had a bad experience in school. And it also would benefit the students who are in their comfort zone, and being able to focused and having that chance would increase the chances of more students will be successful.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0
A8BB150F53AB,"In my oppion, I think technologly is good for the world! Because you can comunicate with people that are far away. Even it's a great way to help you with school like homework, studying and learning also it makes teachers life easier. And I think people would get lost around the world if teachnologly wasn't made. Because GPS helps you to get to your destenation safely also it tells you where you at. Teachnologly is probably the best thing people will carry around them because all your messages, calls and emails comes threw your phone. When I got my first video game, I started playing it 24/7 because I use to play it with my friends during summer break. But one day I knew video games wasn't going to be a big thing anymore so I asked my parents if I could get a phone and they said "" yes I will buy it to you if you bring me good grades the next marking period"". When I got my first phone I started using it to text friends and being in soical media and I know that wasn't going to get me anywhere in life. But one day I thought to myself what if technologly can help you with everything like now adays? Because my computer helps me with homeworks and projects and I can turn it in on time.

Although, some people think technologly is bad because it keeps you out from playing sports, going out with your friends and communicating with people!

Some people don't buy their childrens a phone because they want them to work for it, but some parents aren't like that. People be going on soical media putting there own life at risk, that's why some parents don't let their own child have technologly. Also because people be using it all the time and they don't care whats happens around them. Like my parents didn't want me to have technologly when I was little because he wanted me to open to the world. But I was shy to talk to new people that I didn't even know, I started to be helpful and friendly to everyone because I knew some people didn't have the samething as me. Because some countries are really poor and they don't have money to eat and they can't help out their children with their eduaction.

In fact, I think technologly is always going to be helpful where ever you go, because if you go somewhere that people don't speak your language you'll have your phone on you and you can research there language and it will tell you. I really will not know if technologly was not made because it helps everyone in the world right now. It helps me pay my payments and learn online. So I think technologly is a good way to help you with things and to communicate with people that don't live with you.       ",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

A91103F63B19,"Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle ... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". We tend to persevere when we are used to doing something for a long time but if you don't do anything how will u accomplish and persevere in anything? However been idle doesn't necessarily mean we are incapable of persevering forward, it just means that we lack the spirit to accomplish our goals or dreams. Your inactivity in life doesn't serve a purpose at all in your life instead it serves as your downfall and your weakness in persevering.

People who persevere to accomplish their goals or dreams always end up changing their lives for the better instead of the worst. Like Lionel Messi he didn't give up on his dreams to become a world star athlete because he couldn't walk upright and was always bending over, he continued playing despite been different from everyone else he played with. He played and showed how energetic he was in accomplishing his dream of becoming a world class soccer player. And today he's one of the world's Best and richest soccer players in the world today. He showed that even if you have tried and can't persevere through your goals or dreams, the little effort you put in can do a drastic change in your life. It's amazing to see how much we have done in te last two hundred years pertaining to technology. We didn't do all that by standing around and been idle but by always pesevering to accomplis something greater for ourselves and our society and to move forward. we have created electricity, telephones, telegraph, airplane, motorcycle, automobile and more. we created so much that it pushes us forward to be better people. But the most important one we discovered was electricity because more than half of what we use today uses some form of electricity.

We have created so much that people would not be idle but there are still idle people. Not everyone who perseveres comes from a poor family or had a terrible life when they were little or was disabled, people can persevere where ever they are from. They can persevere even if they look, talk or act different from everyone else as long as they have a strong spirit and a strong will to move ahead and be a better person than they were before nothing can stop them. So let us all be persevering and be able to accomplish our goals by doing somthing good for ourselves.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0
A9A152AAFBE1,I would be interested in joining a program that you guys have to offer. I am very interested in automobiles and would want to look for any companies where I could work on vehicles as my career opportunity. I've always loved the idea that I could one day learn about cars; how a vehicle gets off of the assembly line to the road. There are many companies that are in demand for mechanics to turn wrenches and do not care that they are going to get their hands dirty on the job and for me I would be happy just doing that for a long time. Ever since I was a kid i've worked on my dads' and uncles' car. By changing their tires and putting the tires back and doing oil changes to tuning and modifying my uncles car from a stock making two-hundred horsepower to eight-hundred horsepower. Ever since i've had experience with vehicles in my life time and working in a companies to get my degree and one day open my shop and be able to work on cars would be a dream come true. When I got older I started reading books about cars from the first ever made vehicle to where you had to crank to start the car to when technology was slowly progressing and that was not a thing anymore. Through out the years technologies have increased dramatically and vehicles are being driven by them selves and I would love to work on self derivable vehicles because I know that I would be able to make it right and make sure that the customer is always the priority and I am always hundred percent and determined to make the vehicle an high functioning machine with so much capabilities. I would love to one day work for Tesla or BMW in making electric to hybrid vehicles and knowing that it would be a fun career option while doing something that I always loved ever since I was a little boy I would be grateful. ,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0

The first reason is the older students give a advise to the younger students, the older student are helping with the younger students because when the older student are giving advise to the younger student make them intelligent for example when i was in elementary school in fifth grade my principle asked my teacher to give information or to give idea to the third grader on their project and my teacher sand us to the third grade classroom and my classmate was helping with the third graders.

The second reason is to help them make more understandable on their subject, the older students are trying to make the younger students more knowledgeable in their subject. for example when i was in sixth grade the my best friend was in seventh grade when i needed help with my homework or with same other classes homework and she was always helped me with my homework, testes, and quizzes and i was getting more understandable in my every subjects and she teached me how to solved problems.

Finally to shows the younger s how to do something, older student can be helpful when you need help they can help you. to ilistued. when i came to America i was in third grade i was new and i didn'et know what are the school rules and i didn'et know any thing about school and also i did'net know how to speak English.

AAAAA48F6FEB,"Students should not be allowed to graduate high school a year early, as this will cause students to only have a lack of free time and enjoyment of being in high school. They will have to give up their summer vacations, and even their evening time because of the courses they have to take. The students will miss out on taking electives, as well as missing out on valuable high school experience by being forced to grow up a year early.

With only doing three years in high school, it prevents teenagers from having free time. With the three years only, there is no free time for elective courses. All of the important classes have to fit in one tight schedule in order to maintain and pass all the requirements needed to graduate. I mean at least since you won't have electives you will have more time catching up on your mandatory classes. The lack of electives and and the three year plan, can cause stress and anxiety that prevents teenagers from achieving their full potential. Additionally, the students will lack the amount of volunteer hours and extracurriculars that other students will have through a regular graduation program. The lack of extra activities will prevent students from getting into good colleges, because they will be to focused on school to be able to do anything else.

Doing a three year program means you have to give up summer vacations and evening plans. You will have to take classes over the summer and at night. As a result their will be no more ""summer""

for the students. Instead they are working throughout the year trying to get everything they need done first in order to graduate and receive their credits. In order to get classes during the night time, students would have to find a way of transportation. The county will be paying also more money for teachers. Driving to school would result in students spending money on the increasing price of gas. Spending money would also extend to paying teachers for their extra teaching hours. High school in the three year program would result in spending lots of excess money and increase complications in students' lives.

Many students wish to pursue a three year high school program allowing them to graduate early. They want to do that because, they have a specific reason. Some students have families that need their children's ability to work, to help provide for the family. Therefore, a three year high school program appeals to the child so they may help support their family. Other families may need the childcare because they have younger siblings, and their parents work multiple jobs. However, a three year program leaves very little time to actually work during the program and can impact the overall success of the student. Many schools have work programs actually connected to the school, so that students can work while still maintaining their studies. However, a four year program is much better suited to the teenage mind, desires, and overall life.

A three year graduation program prevents a teenager from being able to enjoy their high school experience. By graduating a year earlier, their childhood years are taken away as they're thrown into adulthood earlier. Along with missing out on more childhood experience, they lose social aspects for their years. This includes friendships, being able to volunteering, as well as activities. The program can also take a toll on the student by piling on extra work as well as taking a toll on other people, such as teachers and parents. Overall you should always do your research before committing to the program in order to make sure it will be beneficial. ",4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.5

To start off with, My first reason on why i agree with the statement Is because their Is always a saying that says keep trying don't give up. When i read this statement I see that saying because you can't give up you got to keep trying to get what you want.

Second, With the statement saying ""success consitts of going from failture to failture' I agree with just for the smiple fact that In life you will go through some rough times and you may not always succeed In what you are trying to do or accomplish, because someone will always fail at something they are trying to accomplish but will keep trying because at some point they will complete what they had tried to accomplish the whole time.

Last, Someone can't lose hope of trying to complete something because they will complete it. They have to stay motivated to keep on going and keep on going to complete it. Everyone will be successful but If someone just gives up and doesn't keep trying then they won't get what they wanted to accomplish. Some people don't know that enable to succeed they will fail at it plenty of times but they would have to keep trying to succeed at it and can't lose hope.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5

When students have confidence is important because they can turn in their work with out thinking about getting a bad score, Students can put their best effort in their work and they have confidence they'll have a good score. when students have confident they want to participate more in class do class activities, Students having confidence is important because they can have a positive mindset and they have that confidants to teach other.

Students having self-respect is important because they learn how to respect them selves and others, when self-respecting they think about what they are going to say before they talk sometimes students didn't mean to say it in a wrong way do they make them selves look bad and others start making fun of them. when we have self-respect we learn how respect our decision how to talk with manners.

Setting up goals is important because you build off the skills you already know and getting better. when i was in art class i kept getting bad grades and i never thought that i was going get better at drawing, but I set myself a goal to get better at drawing go i started practicing everyday and started to build off my skills and eventually i get better at it. Now i love drawing with a Passion. when students set goals they can get better and achieve more then they can ever imagine they could. setting up goals and achieving is a good representation because it's showing them that they can achieve and do more than they could ever imagine

I think that if you really want to know about life's important value you need to either ask a guidance from expert that know all of the information about life's important matters or if you know the right information you will be fine but its also a great idea to check with experts to make sure that the information you know it's correct or to learn more about it.

In Life you will not know some things thats why another great idea is that you seek guidance expert that knows about life's important matter. Most time time people can be positive that they know about life's important matter and they dont need to seek help and that completely normal .

Seeking guidance from expert can help anyone know more about useful information about Life's important matter and much more information. While if you dont seek guidance you won't be able to learn anything about life's important matter.

AC5D4FAD6FDA,"Imagine a classroom fill with students using their cellphones. What do you think they are really using their cellphones for? Some students do not really use their cellphones for educational purposes but use it as an excuse to wonder off and get distracted with it. Students should not be granted permission by any teacher to use their cellphones in class, it is a mistake.

A major distraction now a days is social media. Instagram,Snapchat, and Youtube have impacted the lastest generations. When teacher allow their student to use their phones most of them at times just login into instagram or snapchat. It can easily be proven by the amount of students that come after class and tell their teacher they could not complete their classwork. Social media can be a weapon in and out of school , it will distract students from their work.

Social media isn't the only distraction a student can have from completing class work. I've notice that student at my high school download these new games on their cellphones. When a teacher of mine tells us to pull out our cellphones to do some research, I see more than half the class flip their phones and start to play this new game called Fortnite. This game is very addictive that those students who decided to play when asked to do research, their grades dropped straight down to a failing grade. This is why allowing students to use their cellphones can be a mistake,they are failing their courses.

Texting you're friends during class is the last distraction for a student. Students during class might've been waiting for so long to text their freinds back. Most of the times it's really not more of a ""hey"" or ""how are you doing?"". Students really have long conversations and get carried along that they forget what they were asked to use their cellphones for. High schoolers are always just on their phones texting one another and wait until last minute or the last day a assignment is due. Texting can be the worst distraction for students and this is why they should not be allowed to use cellphones for ""educational purposes"".

In conclusion, schools should prohibit teacher granting permission to student to use cellphones during class. Cellphones can be distracted and it will allow many students to fail courses or not complete asssignments. Students spend more time on social media , games , and texting their friends more than doing homesworks or even reading a book.          ",3.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0

CLASSES FROM HOME BY WAY OF ONLINE OR VIDEO CONFERENCING. DO YOU THINK

STUDENTS WOULD BENEFIT FROM BEING ABLE TO ATTEND CLASSES FROM HOME:

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. Parents do not want their children to attend classes from home. Students will not get much benefits, whoever if they live in a place that is far away from school or they can't attend school for any reason then its has benefits. I'm not agree that students should attend classes from home because students can have stress, students can not pay attention very well, and the most important fact is that it will affect on students' grades.

The first reason is that the students can get stressed everyone time whenever they attend the class online because i know that its not easy to take classes online. students have to pay more attention. They can not understand very well by online or on video conference. It will be hard for students to learn or to understand their lesson online. Students will be stressed out because no one will be there to help them, not any teacher and either any friend (any other student).

The second reason why students should not take classes at home is that they will not able to pay attention by taking online classes. it does not feel like the school environment. students will spent more time on their school. At least in schools we pay more attention than doing our homework at home, because we mostly spend our time on our devices (cell phone) and on the television by watching episodes, cartoon movies, other movies, and etc.

The third reason is that it also affect on students grades and in the future they can not attend their favorite college. They won't able to understand the lesson, they will get bad grades in all subjects. It is so important to attend the classes at school, then you will know what is going on. students can ask teachers if they are having problems in their lesson. teachers can help them during school timing or after school. It will be easy for students to understand or to pay attention and they can get good grades too in all their subjects.

Students should not take classes at home. It will affect on their grades because they will not able to pay attention, they will get stressed out because if student need help, no one will be there to help them for their studies or their lessons, and it will be hard to pay attention at house by doing online studies.

For example, if you have a job and you are constantly absent for work, it gives a bad impression because it demonstrate you are irresponsible, and the people can think bad things about you.

Demonstrate how your personality is because it shows how you can be with the people and demonstrate how you really are. For example, if you are honest and kindness with the people, they can trust you and have possitive thoughts about you.

Shows your live conditions because it demonstrate if you have personal cleanliness, if you care of your self etc. For example, if you go for a interview for apply in a job, and you not take a bath everyday, they would have a bad impression of you and maybe they not accept you in the job, and that led to the people bad comments about you.

I agree that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because some students rather attend to a class at home than at the school so they can focus more; However, some students suffer from bullying, and they rather stay at home and study than attend to school and get bullied again and again. Attend to school at home is a different type of learning is at your own place you got peace.

Attend to school at home is different when you talk about focus, at home, you at your own place quiet, you don't have people around you to stop you or distract you. One day at high school I was trying to focus for a test retake but I coudn't because my friend kept distracting me and that made fail my retake. If I was at home learning in peace without distractions maybe I would pass the test. The point is that studying at home is quiet and calm what can help you successfully at your school grades.

One of the biggest reasons students attend to classes at home is due to bulllying every high school students suffer from bullying whats is wrong but we can't change people we got sometimes you got to change your strategy so you can live a healthy life, thats why some students decide instead of getting bullied every day attend to school at home. I had a problem at freshman year that i've got bullied every time because of how skinny I was and I was kind sad, all my grades went down and I didn't knew what to do;Therefore, if I decided to attend school at home I woudn't have to face this problem every school day. In this case being abble to attend school at home helps a lot of students.

Allthrough, attend school at home got some issues too, when you attend school at home you don't socialize, you don't get to know a lot people, One of my favorite soccer player once said that ""the only thing that attending school at home does not help is at socializing, meeting new people."" that's of the reason not a lot people attend school at home, because they like to meet new friends, being together with people that you like.

AD28F2915402,"I didn't heard much about that, but what I read in this prompt is that ""some high schools districts offers programs that allow high schools students to graduate early instead of four years"", it means that they should have extra classes in summer, and they are not able to take elective courses. These are my thoughts that I have:

First, I can see that they don't have a brake to relax (except winter brake and some holly days, sometimes teachers give students homework for winter brake) , they are always studing hard, so they get stress.

second, usually they have a lot of homework, that's one of the reason that they don't really have time to their families and friends; they can get depress too and start feeling alone, that's what usually happen to me.

After that, they are done with the school early, so they have one year to chill or may be have a part time job, except that their parents make them join to college early. They keep studing, and then sometimes people have to move from house, because the college is at another state or city, so they have to rent a room close to the college.

In conclussion, graduate in less time is better and worst at the same time, but people know what they do with their lifes, in my opinion I prefer to graduate like a normal student, in four years.

AE178808D4FB,"An enjoyable way to spend time outdoors would be to go to a state park. Spening time outdoors is a good way to relex yourself. Also because then you can enjoy new activities. Doing outdoors activities is a good way to learn new things and explores stuff. Outdoors activities is a good way to spend time with your family,friends. Doing outdoor activity can calm down all your stress and make you feel fresh. Outdoors actvities are important for you because they keep you energized and you do need to spend some times outdoors not only indoors.

Someone might find going to a state park enjoyable because thee will be a lot of fun activities you can do there. Also because then you can discover new things there. In state parks there are varities of new resources and things you may enjoy. There are more fun activities but in my opinon i think going to a state park is more enjoyable and fun. Going to a state park is a good way to spend your time because it can keep you energized and active. State parks do have a lot of space where you can sit and talk to your family or friends. State parks may have a food court aswell.

State parks can be small or big but it depends on which one you are going to. Usally state parks are big and filled with beautiful flowers. There may be a age limit on some of the state parks activities. You may think that parks are boring but you are wrong because parks do have fun activities but i know some parks are boring but parks like state park, community parks, and national parks aren't. If you don't like parks then you must go to a state park because they are really beautiful and may change your thoughts on going to a park. You can also book a birthday party or just a regular party and it will be really fun to book a party because state parks are really big and you will have enough space.

I know you may be wondering when is a good time to go to the state parks, well in my opinion i think going to state parks when its sunny and a good weather because you need that vitamin D. There are different timings when the state park will open each day so you may need to take some time out to go there. On weekends the state parks may be full and you may not even have space to sit but on weekdays there not that full so i think you may wanna go on a weekday so you can have enough space to play around or spend some time with your family, friends. Taking small kids to state park can make them happy and have time to play around.

At some state parks you may find some beatiful butterfly's flying around, isn't that beautiful. You can also meet new people and make good friends there. State park is just a peaceful and calm way to spend your time. If you look forward to going to a park then go to a state park because it has everything you want in a park. State parks don't have any fees to enter it its just opened but you may have to pay for the activities. Thats why I think outdoors activities are important.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0

is like saying that people are more afraid of success that they're are in failure. what Winston is talking about that is okay to lose once in awhile as long you have that smile in your face that you already a winner of yourself, like playing a soccer game but your team loses but you lose as a team, failing a quiz you just gotta do better in the retake you can't give up on something that is precious to you. People make mistake and people learn from it just try to do better next so you can succeed on winning. Some people are scared to take the chance to succeed because that taking a risk of failure and people have but you won't know if you try. Winston Churhill want people to never give up on your dream. if you learn more about the subject you won't got no worried about a thing.

when I play soccer there was one problem, I never passed the ball to my teammates. The coach always got mad at me for not passing the ball. Sometimes I gave up because I forget to pass the ball. There was no way that I can remember to bass the ball. The coach always tells me in every game to pass the ball.

I dont know what to do to remember to pass the ball. If the other team has it I attack to get the ball but when I get it on my feet I cant pass because its hard. The only thing I can do is go in Google or YouTube so it can help me. Sometimes I don't know what to do to get better, its hard watching YouTube or going to Google is the only thing I can do to get batter, or not forget to pass, and help me. I search up ""why do I never pass the ball and how can I get better to pass or not forget to pass the ball."" It helped me a lot and now I started trying my best to get better at soccer and its going good so far. every game i have passed the ball.

AF4A2E8AD2A5,"Some people argue that working in a group has more benefits then working working alone. Some people also argue that working alone has more benefits then working in a group. Working alone is more beneficial the working in a group because, if one person in the group does not come to school the group will be short a person, if a member in the group does not care about the project, and not everyone is going to agree with each others ideas and opinions.

If a member in the group does not come to school the group will fall behind and not turn the work on time. if a person in the group is sick with a virus they would have to miss school and miss work on the project and that would hold back the rest of the group from turning in the project on time. When being put with someone who does not come to school often will cause stress on the rest of the group and also a delay. When working alone the worry of a group member not coming to school is not a thing because its alone.

When someone in the group does not care about the work the group will be held back because then more work would have to be done by the others. When being put with someone who does not care is hard because only the rest of the group is doing the work and putting in effort. Working in a group would also not be fun because you have someone who is not doing anything. When the group is working the one who does not care would be sleeping or on their phone. When working alone there is none of this to worry about because it is a independent assignment.

When working in a group not everyone is going to agree with each other on the same ideas. If one person says they do not like that idea, the group would have to take time and all agree on something as a group. Agreeing on something would take up to one or two classes and that would waste a lot of time and put the project behind. When working alone there is not agreeing on anything, it is whatever that person chooses.

Working in a group it would be more fun but when working alone more work can be done. Being pared with friends is nice but the amount of work able to get done when alone is a lot more.

Reason number one is that students that had A's and B's in the past years like middle school and the beginning of high school maybe qualify for the three year insted of the four year of high shool, because they are so intelligen that they not need the four years of high school.

Reason number two is that if they graduate from high school they may like to apply for a community service for there college aplication.

Reason number three is that some student don't have the money to pay for college so they may need a year to save some money to pay for college, or some student may not like college so they are only going to finish high school, and they are going straight to work, and the more experience you learnd form a jod the better it is so is a good idea to begin at a younger age.

Are you having a hard time deciding something? if you are you should talk to other people and see what they think its good to see what others think because, they can help you decide and give you great ideas,for example i had a friend and she would help me decide all the time and she would give out great ideas and i would pick the right decision with her help.

Also they can give you ideas and you can decide what is the best one and you can make the right decision and see what is the best idea and you can make the right decision not just that but you can see how others think and they might think different from how you think for example if you think that chocolate is better and your friend thinks strawberry is better then you should give a try and see if you made the right decision by picking strawberry instead of chocolate or she might be wrong and chocolate is better then strawberry but you will never know in till you try it.

Perhaps they can help you see things in another perspective,also you can make new friends while your at it,but not just that you can share your ideas as well and they can see what you think and help you out if your stuck and they will tell you if your doing something wrong and help you out and see it in another perspective,you might think that going to the movies is better and your friend might think that staying at home and watching a movie is better and she starts telling you why its better and you end up staying home and watching a movie because the reason she gave you where good.

You should give new things a try to because you will never know if its a good idea or not just ask your friends on what you should do during the weekend and they will help you and you will be able to try new things and take new ideas from that and its also nice to talk to someone and share ideas it will keep your mind off things and you wont be as stressed because you will have someone helping you.

There are many reasons for explain that takes classes from home is a good idea, this are some of them:

First, the students that take class at home don't need to leave from home, nothing can detain take classes. The weather changes don't affect to take a class, if is snowing, raining or are a hurricane in the city.

The parents of the students that take class from home can be more unsuspecting, because they sons are in home, also this is benefit for the parents of students that take classes from home; they can be sure that nothing danger can be happen to they sons. The student don't have any excuses for be absent. This is good for the students because they at final a year has perfect attendance.

Second, the students that take class at home just can be absent, if they need to stay in home and don't take some class, they have the opportunity to explain to the teacher by text or just a call, then the teachers need to ask to your parents if is necessary don't take classes because you don't feels good. The students that take a regular classes in the schools can't do this because they need to be in the school everyday , if not in this case the correspondent sub school has the obligation to put absent in the class day.

Finally, the students that take class at home can't missing a class, they don't have the possibility to missing the bus or miss some useful for the school. The students can't forget the computer, pencil, notebook or other things that we use in school, because they have all classes online, this can be positive for the students that stay in home at care to they parents the student can't has some distractions that sometimes has in the school, like talk with any friend, use a inappropriate language to the teacher or don't pay attention, if can be some possibility to the student miss some class; they can take the missing class latter.

In conclusion, take a classes from home is a good choice because stay in home, do not have any absent if are sick, and don't missing class, are a good idea for take classes at home, the benefits that this have are good for parents and students that need to have more family time, or need to have more time with they sons.

you need totry and see how it works out and if you are succesful with it then you master it even more bigger to become even more bigger so that is why i agree with what Ralph Waldo wrote.

one reason why i agree with Author Ralph is beacuase it is true once you mastered somehting you can also do something beyond like bigger. so that is one reason why i agree with what he wrote second reason why i agree with Ralph Waldo when he says ""unless you try to do something"" which i think its true if you try to do something and u make a mistake you can keep trying like lets say you go to collage and you failed 3 class and you give up which its not a good idea because you will make mistakes in life not all the time but sometimes so that is what i think when he says ""unless you try to do something"" means like you at least need to try once and see how it goes. thrid reason is he says you will never grow and what he is trying to say is that if you master somehting beyond that what you have already acomplished and you go more bigger then you will grow because you did somehting on your own and bigger so that is why i think there is a thrid reason.

These are all the reasons why i agree with waht he wrote and why i agree with him like i said you ned to try to bigger things in life and become more succesful and get more better things have what you want like buy a car a house and go on vaction with your famliy and like i said for reason two i said if you try and make a mistake you need keep on trying and become a better person. so that is what i think about what he wrote and why i agree with him.

Dear principle,

I would like to help in the community service group. I think it is very important for us as student's to help in the community service. It is important because we need to show that we care for our community and world. Some people say that it is a waist of time to be helping the community and the world they think that that's why their are people to work and take the trash out and stuff like that. But we cant leave other people that work all day and all week when they are tiered and want to rest to be picking our left overs!! Some people are eating at the park, mall, store, etc. and they think that when they are eating they could just through their rappers and some food on the ground and not pick it up they live it their so others can pick it up for them and i think that is WRONG!!! The people that have food, drinks, etc. and are eating any were they should throw their trash in the trash can's when they are done eating their food. And i think if we pass by trash being in the floor we should pick it up because to be honest i don't think another person would pick it up but they should. We don't want our community/world to be dirty and stinky with trash all over the place. We want our world to be clean and with nice fresh air that we could breathe with NO problem. That's why i want to join in the community service group to help our community /world be a better place for other people and us even if others don't want to help but i think that every one should be in the community service group and help the community.

In my position I think it's a great idea to attend classes from home only if you work, or if you can handle any type of work by yourself without a person that will persuade you to do the work, and if you know English perfect.

I think that some students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because for some students it's difficult to wake up early because some students who work on

Part-times, and some students don't want to wake up early, or they go to bed late for playing games on their phones.

Secondly. I think that some students might benefit from this program if they can handle any type of work independently without a teacher or any person persuading them to do the work, because some students are smart and they like to work independently, in silence, without people disturbing thems or without too much explanations.

Also. I think that the only students that can understand any work and can only attend classes from home, are those who knows English Perfect, because if you know English perfect then you can work in any topic or subject without the help of anybody, If you are a Hispanic born in other country then this program it can work for some Hispanic students because they are used to get everything easy, to get what they want without making a effort.

In the other hand, I think that this program it won't help to those students who distract easy or those who don't do work without any person who will persuade them to do the work, because there are students who likes everything easy, students who don't want to make an effort, this program it won't work to those students who don't like to study, to those who have only F on their classes or those who are skipping, or not going to school.

In conclusion I think this program can only help those students who can handle any kind of work without the help of any person. and for those students who have dreams, those who makes a effort to get what it can help thems in the future, for those that knows that life it's not easy, to those students that know that if you don't work for it you won't get what you want on life. those students who can handle any kind of work without the help of any person.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5

My grandpa once said to me "" giving up is just for lazy people that don't care about life, so fight through until your successful"". My grandpa was a very wis man, he loved sharing wisdom with anyone that was having a bad day. Well how can you change someones day by just telling a wis thing, has anyone told you anything that change your life and why you should never give up.

You can change someones day by just saying good luck. Last year I was walking to school, I was very scared and worried because I had a unit test. Then this lady came and started talking with me, she asked me questions and suddently said good luck that made me so releived and I got this feeling that I was going to do good on the test. You can change someones day without you knowing that you were acually wis and helped change their day. When someone gives you a chance to tell you wis things always accept and just listen because one day you may give it to someone else in the future and they will pass it on to other people.

Has anyone gave you widom? My grandpa did once, it was the best thing I ever heard and I still remeber the day he told me, it was the day before he died I have a feeling he knew that he was going to die the day after. My grandpa was a very caring and nice man he loved everyone. Everyday I remeber going to the hospital any wonder why did he have to die and leave me. Wis people are the ones that can change the world, make an impact on someones life and are the believers. Sharing wisdom is not bad it is a very important thing to other people because my grandpa said ""giving up is just for lazy people that don't care about life, so fight through until your successful"" from that day I always try my hardest so if he is watching me he knows that he impacted me in so many ways. I have shared wisdom with my friends my favorite one was, believing in yourself is the key of life, that means believing in yourself is what is going to get you through life, tough times, and challenges.

You should never give up because if you do you will regret everything in the future. Giving up is not going to make you successful in anyway in life. Giving up is when you never got to hear a word about believing in yourself or you have never accepted a wis word from anyone. People can just say anything to bring you down but fighting through is the oppisite of giving up. My parents always told me to never give up because giving up means you want to shut anything in your brain and not do anything about it. Wisdom can change a way of how your feeling and the ways you can change the world anyday or anytime. If you are going to give up, there are a lot of people that are going to try helping in life so take the chances they give and believe in yourself.

Wis people can change the world. Giving out wisdom to anyone is the best feeling and you should never stop giving it out even if its the only wis things you know.

This is a great way for students to still take classes and learn more their education. The generation from now aren't as motivated as generations before. Theres might be a some people that wont agree with this statement because they probably think going to school is better than taking classes online or conferencing from home.

Some people may say that it isn't a great idea for schools to offer distance learning for students especially the parents. Most parents would want their kids to go to school and take classes because they think it's better for them. They probably think that they're are ways to cheat if they take classes online. Some parents would want their kids to interact with other students and not just be home all the time.

I agree on all the reasons why they student shouldn't take distance learning as an option but I think otherwise. It's a great option for students because there are many student that fail or drop out of school just because they didn't attend school. If students had the option to take classes online from home then it would give them a second chance to pass and graduate so they wouldn't give up. It even may help other students understand the curriculum more.

The generation now are giving up at such a young age just because they don't even want to attend their classes at school. This is why its a great idea for schools to offer distance learning so students won't just give up and drop out. Having the opportunity to take online classes from home with probably help those students the don't want to attend school. The students would take classes from their homes and learn the same information they would learn at school.

In conclusion, I think it would benefit many students if schools offered distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. It's a great way for students who don't like attending school most of the time. It would be a great advantage for students to have that offer of distance learning, it woud make a huge difference for the generation of students now a day.              ",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0
B370B0D18727,"I think that working with a group is way better, because working with a group gives you a better understanding of what you are doing and helps you to be more focus. its can also be very important when you have your teamates around you that if there is any mistake you and your teamates can come together and try to solve that issue. and also working with a group can be very beneficial. because working with a group can also makes u feel confident and makes you good at social interactions. so that when u go out in the world you already know how to interact with your boss and fellow coworkers. and working with people can also make u grow not physical but to grow as a person and to make u more mature and to make u have a better understanding of life and of your responsibilities. so i feel that as a young adult comming up in this world. i would like to have my work experience with a group. that way i can be more aware,focus and to be more understanding of my environment that im working in and that i can learn not just from my self but learn from the people around me.

Working with a group can also be fun you can work with kids your age or you can work with people older than you. it can teach you self awareness,kindness towards others and its can influence you in so many ways because if you are working with people older than you are going to start acting more mature and want to live up to your teamates expectations. and also working with a group can improve on manners, behaviour,self esteem, self conduct and politeness. working in group is very important you can have experience and learn alot from other people it also teaches you what to expect and how to prepared for it in the future. it also teaches you how to act around others and teaches you the importance of life so i think that working with a group is better it teaches you better and you can learn better.

B3F0F2F6487F,"should the school extend the school day two hours and four-day a week?

people have different opinion about being ten hours in the school day. some people think it is a good idea for their kids to be ten hours at the school day. However, I believe that being ten hours in the school day it is not a good idea, because it dose not help for the energy and the resources, everyone's brain needs to take a break in the day and ten hours working in the school day is too much for a kid.

First, being ten hours in the school day dose not help in the energy and the resources; Because we spend the same amount of time at the school, But instead of spending an eight hours a day in five-day a week we will spend ten hours a day in four-day a week. so we are going to spend the same amount of energy in both.

Second, everyone's brain needs to a break. If we spent ten hours of our day at the school we are not going to be having that much time to live our lives, do our work and see our family. everyone needs to relax and sleep enough during the day to focus more and do more good at school.

Finally, ten hours is too much for a kid to spend in a day at the school. kids will dislike going to school. they will get tired. for example when my sister stay a little longer after school for extra work, she comes back home so tired, not talking to anyone and doing noting, because she is tired of being a little bit longer at the school.

In conclusion, as you have read. extend the school day two hours a day in four-day a week is not a good idea because it dose not help to conserve energy and the resources, everyone's brain needs to take a break in the day and ten hours working in the school day is too much for a kid. so what we can do is not extend the school day two hours a day, so all the kids can do good at the school, focus more and live their life happy.

B459B5B87707,"Just listened that people started taking classes in summer for graduating in three years, Where are the breaks? Don't they need any break. Even machines don't work perfectly after being used continuously for a long time. Doesn't the same goes for humans? In fact, we need more break because we have a lot to do with friends and family. What is the purpose of going to three year graduation if you don't get time to spend with your closest ones? One year is not a long time if you are in a productive environment and surrounded by positive people then why to go for three year graduation in high school ?

High school isn't just about graduating it is about making memories, spending time with friends and learning to socialize. High school is the time when everyone, even the most innocent start to get off their limits and it is when the fun begins. Everyone like to have fun, joke around with friends and skip the school for no reason. It may seen like a child play to most but those who miss this part, miss the most enjoyable days in their life. In the old days it is not money or success that makes you happy, it is memories from your past that bring a light, wrinkled smile on your face.

Memories are memories you can let them die but what will you do of your interest, interest never leave. It will always hunt you in your dreams. If you are scared of failure and not fulfilling your wishes never leave the electives, which you obviously miss if you go for three year graduation. Electives are not needed for graduation but graduation only doesn't serve a purpose. If you can't have a class that you enjoy because of three year graduation then, interest and wishes are worth giving an extra year and you also get so much with it. Human beings don't need much to be happy even a small success or a short class that gives them pleasure can have their face bloomed for the whole day.

More ever, high school teaches to take mature decision and have good manners. It is not that we get a extra decision making class or manner class in high school but being in high school itself teaches to take better decision. Being around with people teaches us to behave accordingly. Having many friends and busy time schedule teaches us to tell 'no' sometimes. It is the place where most of the people struggle and get a better direction in their life. Everyone becomes a better person when they graduate from high school compared to what they were in their middle schools.

Being a high school student it is not wrong to dream for one year faster graduation for the sake of one year job experience and one year salary. In my opinion, one year of job experience and salary is not even close to the memories you have with your friends and the happiness you fell when you come to school.

In the nutshell, everyone of us know that college life is not so enjoyable and fun as school life. We hope to do so much but can't accomplish our wishes in the whole college year. One extra year of high school can do more than ten more years in life. Is a year too costly to spend for the life long experience and knowledge? Of course not. Some may think that three year high school saves a lot of time but trust me, it will be the thing that you will regret most in your old age. This four year of high school is the golden time for everyone as it gives the life long memories and a never ending satisfaction to each and every student who has attended high school.",2.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0
B49D86AC2062,"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm? its a 50% chance you will be successful,reason for this is that some people give up too easily,some people get tired of failing and failing again. You dont need to fail many times before you get successful.

Some people never put in work to be successful as they are today some just became successful out the cut. Right now the world we live in you dont really need to put in alot of effort,there are many ways of being successful for example we have social media! Social media now has a big impact in the world we live in.

Scientists are perfect examples of this statement. A scientist can start an experiment and fail over and over again till they get they expected the results. Students can fail a test over and over again but whiles he's failing hes learning from his mistakes to pass his test.

Working on something new or getting used to something new,you wont get it right the first time you would mess up or fail but once you keep getting used to it you learn from your mistake which helps you to become successful.

B543953F757A,"When I think about and enjoyable activity, I think about sports, and the reason why it's because a lot of people find sports as a fun way to be healthy and make them feel better of them self by being physically active, I also believe that any sport is a good example to learn from others as well as your self, and for I know sports is not all of just about competing against other teams and winning or loosing, is very helpful if we're talking of team work.

One of the most enjoyable activities in the world it's sports, in some way many different kind of sports have proof that it's a really entertainment thing to do and to be as much healthy then doing a diet from a doctor's recommendation, people actually agree that if there's something that might have a plethora of fun and includes a reason to be healthy in daily life it's sports,a 78 % of people in planet Earth consider and invited people to joying a sport for the good of others and good of your self too.

Sport it's a specific activity that in cases have help people feel better about who they are, how they look, and the way it has change people globally, most of the time a person doesn't know what they like to do even thought they try other stuff like being smart, video games, music etc,

they feel like they don't belong or fit in something, but at the end they go along about what other friends says about sports and find them self the right place to be.

Sports as a good educational activity example of learning about others as learning from your self, is very important when getting a job that consist in the statement of knowing other people, like being a teacher, a teacher doesn't get a job without presenting him/her in general to his/her teachers partner, or teach a class without presenting to the students in classes they'll be taking, they will also ask a new student to present him/her self to every one in the classroom,teachers mostly do with their classroom as a coach will do with his team in a sport.

These two educational activities are alike to each other in the simple reasons that they both teach their learners to get to know each other and get along with one another, another way that they're alike is that they're preparing them for the big challenges, a English teacher prepared the students for the big writing SOL as a soccer coach prepared the players for the final game of the season.

However it's not only learning from others, many times sports definitely let you learn more about yourself, it takes out the person who you truly are it will also take all those stuff that you had no idea you new, doing sports can have experiences in which you'll learn from.

Team work is the hard work that a group does together to complete their goal, it's not about the leader or the best member of the group, what most matter in team work is work as a group no matter the worst or best you do.

If you ever play a sport you might know that the main thing to do is team work, for example football,if one of the football players has the ball, he can't go across the field and do a touch down if his team mates don't do anything to stop the defenders of the other team that wants to knock him out,but if they decided to play the game by doing team work he would of made a touch down because he's team mates would of help him pass through by knocking the defenders.

Sports team around the whole world has a immense number of followers, followers keep on touch with them because they have something relative to it or because they had won a lot of times,and this is thanks to the strategy they do ( team work ),

In conclusion sports are not only of competing against others, is something that is productive in the way that you don't only get a metal or a good job, sports are also to have fun with friend or even with people you don't know, and it's a really good way of being healthy and be able to do two things at the same time, it also help us understand other people that needs it as you do with your team mates by knowing them and getting along with them, in sports you can learn from your self when you make a mistake, and finally in any kind of sport you will have to know how to play as team work because that's what matters in teams.

There is a lot of other educational an enjoyable tings to do but I think sports are one of the best ones.",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0

Some believe that attend classes from home is not great for the student. But others think that if you attend classes from home you learn so much more. Attending a school can get you ready in the real world then just attending classes from home.

Those who say attending classes from home say that because teacher cant teach the way they want. They have to follow the way the schools wants you to learn. For example, the teacher does not want to teach some of the stuff hes given but he has to because at the end of the day this is his job and he does not want to lose his job. When your attending classes from home you have more sleep and you wont be tired because it will be at your own time. And also you dont have to be in a class that the teacher dont really like to teach because over time some teachers lose that feeling that they loved.

However, people believe that attending schools is way better then just staying home. Some reasons you should attend school then stay home is that you will have more fun in a class room then just home all the time. For example, you will make friends and do stuff together the will make your time more joy able then just at home. you wake up and go to school you see your friends and you make jokes and help each other and it is limitless.

Another reason you should attend school then classes at home. Schools have field trips,sports,after school activities that you will probably love to do. Because you have the chance to try all of them at school. For example, there are filed trips to the art museum that have great at works like the monalisa. And filed trips to New York and other places that you will love to see. Sport teams are like family, you watch each others back and help improve you game together and thats something you cant get from home or video conferencing. Other reason why you should attend school with others is that someday you will find a bond with someone or a group that will last and you will be grateful for. For example, There were couples in high school that later on got married and there were these groups that became friends actually the became family.

In conclusion, Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some believe that attend classes from home is not great for the student. But others think that if you attend classes from home you learn so much more.

Many student don't like this idea because, they think the attend classes online is so difficult but I don't think so because we have help of all teachers. One reason very important is not mess around, because take the bus for me is lose time, maybe the classes online can start early and we have more information, more experience for the future, the thing more important is learned more, in my opinion the school is a little distraction for many students because they don't pay attention to classes, they go to other places when we need study more for the life.

Another reason is beacuse is about the video conferencing this idea is great because we learned to communicate or socialite with the people in the video conferencing, I think because, some students are silent and this option help you.

For many parents I thinks is a great idea because they have more control in home like they know when the student work in classes or not, maybe the parents wanna see the progress of the children. The idea is productive, is a new experience for the students and parents. Maybe

This option for the students classes from home by way of online is in my opinion a great news because for some people stay in home and practice and study is more comfortable. Classes online is not difficult for the students because in the computer we have modules and information and others things can help you, and is more easy in video conferencing because we have always somebody who can help, we can talk with a teacher or somebody, so is a good idea and new experience.

B7C150A40F86,"It is known, that students truly enjoy the most they can any break of the year. Giving a break to students in the evening and all summer, is better for their process of graduation. That is why, students must do the traditional four years of high school before graduating.

First of all, since students have so much schoolwork and homework to study, they often need a break, so that way they can relax in their home and do other activities with their family that are not related to school. Summer is a season in which students need to go out in vacations and spend time with their family as well. Generally, not every students and their families get to spend so much time all together in the evenings, that is because of their routine. Most parents have from their jobs summer break, and they prefer enjoying it together with their children. It would be unfair for them to have to not enjoy that much their summer with their children just because the students have courses during the summer.

Another reason of why students must do the traditional four years of high school before graduating, is because after they graduate, they are more prepared for the career they decide doing. It would not be a recommendable period of time having three years of high school for students that still need to keep studying and preparing themselves for the career that they are going to study in college. The students can get more experience while they are reaching to their goal which is their graduation.

In high school, every student should have at least an idea of what they are going to be dedicating themselves for the rest of their lives, and most of them suffer by not knowing what career to choose. Some students may say that they would really wish graduating as soon as possible, but the fact is, that by being in a hurry of getting out of high school with a diploma, they would make the mistake by maybe choosing the wrong career in college for themselves, or even maybe deciding to not go to college just because they did not have the enough time of high school to think and decide the options that colleges offer. Giving students more time for this particular decision is a good way to let them know what they are capable of doing in their future.

In conclusion, students having four years of high school includes many benefits that can help them to be more prepared for college, rest more in summer, and giving them a better process of high school for their future in college and job. Students can challenge themselves by experiencing the traditional four years of high school and see the advantages of the result that they reached which will be very beneficial for them.

Also, every individual knows their own reasons that an expert does not knows those reasons for a healthy and a save decision. An expert would never know what a person needs and what is the problems of a person in order to make a decision for him. Therefore, people should make their own decision in important matters of life.

In conclusion, it could be said that people should make their own decisions because every individual knows their own good, a person will always go for the healthiest decision, and it is also profitable for their present and future. At the end, people should always trust their selves for making their decisions.

B7FABBC13A0F,"""Character is something what you yourself choose to make it""

I agree with John Lubbock because our character is something we make by ourselves. We make ourselves the person we become in the future. We choose our traits and characters by ourselves. Everyone has a right to choose what's best for themselves. Some people choose worst traits but others choose good. It depends on ourselves what we want to be in the future. Although some traits in a character of a person comes from experiences and most of the time bad traits comes from the worst experiences in our life. But it is completely our choice if we want to make those bad experiences a process of learning and learn something good from them. Some people choose to learn worst possible things from their experiences that's how most of the people get their worst traits. It is not wrong to say that people choose what they want to be and how they want their life. It is true that some traits are formed beyond our control but it depends on ourselves if we want those trait in our characters or not.

Some people get too comfortable with bad traits and they don't want to change their selves for example lying is a worst trait anyone can possibly have it leads to do things that we don't even want to do but we do it anyways because we get comfortable and have no fear. ""Lying is not better than silence"" so it is way better to not say anything than lie about it. Lying is something that leads to other bad traits like dishonesty. If a person is not honest than they are not trustworthy. Trust is something very important because it is extremely hard to gain.

If a person is not trustworthy than there is nothing they can do other than try not to lie. Trust is like a glass if it breaks it will never be the same. All these problems are caused by lying and it depends on our to choose if we want to lie and make ours characters full of worst traits or be a better person choose good traits. In this world there is nothing more important than being who we are and choosing best for ourselves.

Our characters can formed by influences beyond our control for example something bad that happened in the past can lead a person to lie and being dishonest. Lying is not something to be proud of and bad experiences doesn't give anyone the right to lie because it doesn't matter. There is a huge difference between right or wrong. We choose our traits and what we want our characters to be like by ourselves we should know what's good and bad for ourselves. Even though sometimes being honest and speaking truth can lead to difficult situations and most people don't want to deal with difficult situations which is okay but it is important to do something right. Difficult situations make a person stronger and traits like honesty will make us proud of ourselves in future. Most of times its the journey that matters the most than the destination because it not about how we choose to become a better person it is about the experiences that led us to who we will be in the future. It is about how some people choose to learn worst possible things from their experiences but others learn good things from them. It is true to say that we become what we want to be and we choose our traits by ourselves. The harder the path will be the stronger the person becomes so it depends on ourselves to choose good or bad. There will be always two paths one will lead to good and other will lead to bad although our it depends on our own selves to choose from right or wrong,good or bad the choice is ours. If we want to be become something we'll be proud of or something we will be ashamed of. We write our stories by ourselves so it is all on in our hands what we want to be.

Although some people might disagree and yes it is true that our characters can formed by influences beyond our control but it depends on us what we want to be. Everyone knows the difference between right or wrong. There will be consequences of choosing bad and sometimes it will be easy to not be brave and choose the worst traits for ourselves. It is completely your decision if you want to add good traits in your personality or bad traits. The difference between Joker and Batman is that Batman chose good traits while Joker turned himself evil by choosing bad traits. Even though tragic experiences led Joker to be evil but his past didn't give him the right to be evil. So,you can't be evil because of your past and becoming a better person or having good traits will lead to a better future because it past is past and future is something to look forward to. Traits like honesty and being able to do what's right without any fear will make us proud of ourselves in the future. Everyone wants to be proud of themselves and to make that possible they need to adapt good traits. Good traits will lead to success and a better future which is very important to for ourselves. Bad traits will lead to an unsuccessful future and which is not best for anyone. It is important to choose good traits.

In conclusion the person we choose to become today will reflect on our future selves whether we choose good or bad traits. The decision is ours and what we want to be ourselves to be like it totally depends on us. Most of the problems in our lives can be solved by choosing good traits over evil. Good traits will lead to success and a better future which is very important to for ourselves while bad traits will lead to an unsuccessful future and which is not best for anyone. It is very important to choose good traits. If you want to be proud of yourself then it is a must to choose good traits. Our traits make our characters and personalities. Some people make their life miserable by choosing what's worst for them like bad traits. It is important for ourselves to choose good rather that ruin our lives with choosing something like bad traits. A person can ruin their character by choosing bad traits. That's why it is extremely important to choose good traits for ourselves because it is good.               ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0
B8656754E9EB,"Do you believe failure could lead up to a better person? Shortly, I am going to discuss as to why making mistakes is necessary for a person to become a better human being. When a person makes mistake he's/she's is more likely to learn from its mistake. However, not all person learn from their mistakes in the first time, some take longer than others. Therefore, you should always look back at what you did wrong and always fix your mistakes. Making right decisions should help you become a better human being for its future community, country, and even the world.

I personally strongly agree with Churchill's statement. A person should not always be right, some people think that by doing what pleases them they are doing good. However, little do they know they're hurting people because they decide whats good for them and whats not good for them. That leads up to a person who is selfish, mean, and has a cold heart. Mistakes are a problem, and problems can always be fixed.

Once upon a time my friend Generic_Name had a girlfriend, Generic_Name. He was a good kid with a good heart, therefore, that led to people takeover him easily. Generic_Name's girlfriend or friend would always takeover Generic_Name. She would tell him what to do and how to do it, she was the man in the relationship. Thats how good my friend's heart was. She knew she could trust Generic_Name because Generic_Name loved her like he never loved anyone else. Till the day came, sooner than what we expected. The day that he will never forget. It was a Thursday and Me and my friend Generic_Name were on our way to work, I was driving when all of the sudden he starts screaming like if he was having some sort of a seizure. "" NO how could you do this to me"" he said. ""What happened?"" I asked. He tells me that he was on snap chat just chatting and looking at snaps when all of the sudden he sees his ""girlfriend' kissing another man. I tell him to relax and to let it go that she was not worth his time. He calms down, breaks up with her and moves on. Years passed, I noticed that he has changed. He is not the sweet boy with the good heart anymore. He now learned from the mistake he did, which was to let his girlfriend controlled him. He now knows when to say NO and when to say YES. People make mistakes all of the time in their lives. However, that does not mean you cannot change it or fix the mistake you did.

Mistakes are mistakes. You cannot go back in time, but you can move on and make a change in your life. In conclusion, a better person makes a better future for its world. People can change,and we all make mistakes. However, we shall learn for the better.

In Conclusion, I would like to give an advice to all people to never give up. You made a mistake? You all shall learn from it. Fix it. Make of yourself a better self being and be and example for all others. We are not perfect, but we could try or at least act like we can be. Learn from what you did wrong an improve yourself.

B983F2965167,"Influencing other with positive qualities by expressing action or even he way how we talk, is the best and only way to represent your character. I strongly agree with Albert Schweitzer, a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people. Because it represents your positive qualities and as well as culture, and help others understand more about you.

One reason that people should behave positively, is that they can represent them selves to others. As an example, people with positive behave draw others' attention by the way how they physically act and speak. They are easy to convince, open to everyone, and humble. In my real life experience, I have met a lot of these kind of people who I consider as friends now.

I was influenced by them the first time we met, with their positive attitude and respect.

Another reason why reason that people should behave positively, is that they can influence others by their culture. In my real life experience, I have who drew my attention by the way how they interact to others and I wanted to know and learn more about his culture and religion.

In the final analysis, acting positively influence the surrounded people, helps making meet and make new friends.",2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,4.0
BB430219DBB4,"In my opinion it's not a good idea because in every country in world it's role that student have to study 12 yeaer in the then have to go to college. There is some people in the world that they would like to graduate early because they don't like school the only reason they don't like the school is that they wake up early and they can't sleep. If we graduate on the time then we can do something to the country. it's good if someone want to take courses because they will learn more things they will have more experiance.

In the other country's the rule in schools are every student have to study 12 years, 7 or 6 book in a book, 12 or 14 test two time in the year the one test is in the half year and the other test is in end of year. In other country after graduate every student of school have to take a big test for college or university in this test the score are start from 1 to 400 hundred the top score is 400 hundred if any one get the first position the president will gave him gift and some money also. The most university are 4 year but only docter have to study 7 years.

Our response is that to tell the student who want graduate early that it's not good to graduate early because you didn't learn anything you came to schools to learn something not for time pass. there is some student they are coming school for time pass they want to pass their time if you ask them a question they can't answer it for that reason we have to complete 4 year in high then graduate. If a student graduate early then college and university will hard for him because he did'nt learn the thing that he need it in the college or univerrsity.

Working in school time is not good for student, because he can't learn anything like in the morning he is coming to schools and after schools he is going to work and he is coming from work night and he sleep so when he will study if he did'nt study he can't graduate. it's rule that 18 year or over 18 have to work but someone is in the school and he is 18 it's not to work his family have to support him to study. It's family responsibilty to tell his child to study. when he gradute then he have to work because he dosen't have to study too much because collage is easy that school.

I hope they change the rule that when student finish thire class and pass ESOL than the are graduate, because the student will take the class that they need it to finish high school and they only focuse on the ESOL and the class that they need if they didn't study the other subjects then why thay make the class they make the class to study and learn something for that reason they have to make a new rule.

BB8DBBD8C4AB,"I agree with this statement, because is hard to be yourself, in a world like this, where the people judge everything in your life, and you have to be how they want, they always are telling you what you have to do or what you not, and they not care about your opinion.

A example:

In my personal life is with my family, they always are telling me what I have to do, and when I do something wrong they judge me, they want to select my friends, my clothes, include my shoes, in a situation like this is difficult to be what you really what to be, and the razon is because they don't give us a chance to demostrate what we really are.

Another example is:

With the people of outside, we never are going to be how they want, if they saw you with a boy who use tattoo they think he is a bad boy, if you are a fat girl your ugly, if you are skinny girl your ugly too, if you use a mini skirt you are a creazy women. So we never will be fine.

Everybody can judge, but we have to be strong, we have to try to demostrate what we are, or what we like to do.

Razons:

We can have a lot of bad situations in this life, Maybe one day we can feel bad or sad, Because we not feel good with the people who judge, maybe we are tired to feign to be another person, or maybe we can think in a negative way. A example of this could be say ""I never do something good"", "" I am not a good person"". So we need to be what we want to be, and love yourself is the most important thing, if you not love yurself no one can love you more then you, obviously we have to know what decisions we want to take, you have to feel good with yourself, with your decisions. You have to show what you are, if you feel good you will be good.

All this are razons for which one is hard to be yourself, and is for that razon i agree with Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson, cause i feel identified with what he say; I feel a winner, i feel happy with my personality, and is because i don't care what the people say, or think about me, is my life, I take my decisions. If I am a creazy women who always is imperative but i feel good with that am fine. I like to be happy, be my self. I really love me. I don't have to feign nothing. The little girl who always was doing what the people saying is in the past not in my present. I learning to be my self, so ""Yes"" I make a greatest accomplishment in my life, and is nice to be your self, now i feel relax, and satify with my decisions, I desmostrated what I am.

BBB9D66F934C,"So i think it we should do the four day school week here at Generic_School.

Because here are one advantage and one disadvantage. The one advantage is that the student will get a three day week end. And then here is a another advantage is that the student would have enough time to finish their homework and project. And then for the one disadvantage is that the student would have a longer school day because they are adding the eight hour that we are going to miss for Friday school day. they would be dividing that eight hour of school for the four day of school that we are going to have. and then here is a another disadvantage like would the student who play sport have short practice because of this like if we do in real life would that actually happen.

So here is my first reason why it is a good reason for this to happen because it would save the school a bunch of money on electric bill. And then here is another good reason that we should do this is that it would help the teacher teach to student understand the material a little bit better. And then here is second reason why it is a bad reason to do this and school like this will give student who play sport a short time to do homework at home because they have school then after school they have practice

So in conclusion we should try this for a month and then after that month we can see if we should keep this thing going on for the rest of the school year. like we can ask the student if they want it to stay. Or we can back the regular secudule like we go the regular time that we get school and then we go back to the five day school week. like in my opinion we should try this out and see how this turn out like would most of the student like this or would most of them hate like i think this is going to be like a 50 50

chance of this working and not working. like i feel like most of the student would like and the rest of student hating this because the extending hour of the school day but the student who are going to love this is because of the three day weekend and then for the teacher they all would love this idea for the school year",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5
BBE74D844874,"The Ways To Success In Life

Failure plays an important role in the path of success. To gain success in life we all have to go from difficult situations. We do not have to lose hope at failure. Failure is the key to success. We learn the lesson from our mistakes. If we will not do the mistake so, how would we learn the things more better. We should learn the things from our failure instead of losing hope. Encourage yourself and other when you you are facing the failure is a good thing. If someone fails again and again in their goal, we have to encourage them for not to lose hope,determination about goals and be enthusiastic.

We need to help people if they need us,if we see someone who are losing their hope because of the failure, we have to encourage them for not to lose hope. Because if they lose hope, they are destroying their dreams and goals by their own hands. At least we have to try something until we reach to our goal. There was a spider, who wants to go to his home but he was not reaching to his home because it was so high, he tried first time he failed, he tried second time he failed but he did not lose the hope. When he tried the eighth time, he reached to his goal just because he did not lose the hope. We have to try as many time as we can but never lose the hope.

We should have determination about our desire. If we are determine about our desire then we can reach to our goal. For the success we have to do a lot of things like hardworking but the main point is determination. For instance if we think we can not do this thing then its really happen. First we have to prepare our minds that this is my desire and I will have to reach my goal. There is nothing wrong to make or see the dreams but the determination about your dreams can take you to path of success.

Be enthusiastic about your work and goal is the great way for success in life. We have to be thrill about our goal. Enthusiasm is a great thing, we have to learn from the failure with out loss of enthusiasm. In the pursuit of success we do not have to be sad. Be happy that you learn from your mistake and now u can do that better than before. From the failure we are getting more experiences. For example when teens go for their first job, they do not have experience. They do not know how to manage their time in job, how to take customers and how to deal with the difficult situations. Every day they do mostly mistake and learns from their failures. At the end of the year they are master in everything but if they do not lose hope and be enthusiastic about their work.

Life is so hard but we can make it easy if we don not lose hope, be determine about our goal and be enthusiastic. To gain the success we have to do a lot of hard work but if we fail at any point we do not have to lose hope and just sit down because we fail. We have to learn from our mistake and just try, try and try until you reach to your goal. If we fails after hard work it does not mean we can not fulfill our dreams. However if we fails after a lot of hard work it means we have to try again. Because hard work will never waste so just keep trying until you reach your goal. So, we should never have to be afraid from the failures. It is good for us to learns more from failure and do better next time. Never give up on your dreams and desires. Try for your ambittions and happiness. One day you will get the success, as Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said that:

BBE9DDA6E3BD,"When I was in the fifth grader I went to the camp over summer the first day they made us do a project with a group to earn the title of the best group. The benefits of working in the group or working alone. Working in the group is more beneficial rather than working alone to work in the group is fun, makes me be more responsible and it is also the easier and creative way of finding solutions for the problem.

First of all, working in the group is fun. For example, I have a friend who didn't like to work with anyone or even talk in his classroom,,, one day his teacher put him with group of students after working with them he finally made a new friends and the work that teacher was giving them was much more enjoyable with mates. For that reason I think this is a great way of learning, communicating and building friendship with people around us.

Also group work makes us more responsible. I have friend his name is Generic_Name and I want to tell you something about him he is the most irresponsible student I have ever seen, but when it comes to a group work he is getting his job always done because he doesn't want his group lose the competition or simply fail the project. This made my vision clear that working with others makes people more responsible.

Some say working with a group distracts them from the task, but I will disagree with them because I believe, that working in the group helps you find the creative way of solving the problems. In my computer science class we usually work with groups so there is this guy that thinks he knows more than some of us and for that reason he didn't work with us, so we solved the problem the way that no one in our class has solved the problem this way and the teacher gave us extra points for being the creative group of the class, and the smart guy that I mentioned before couldn't solve that problem. This is way I don't like to underestimate my teammates or classmates I know that together we can be smarter, faster, and even

If the problem seems unsolvable together we can do it.

In conclusion, working with a group is enjoyable, make you fulfill your obligations, and makes it easy for students to solve any kind of tasks. Finally, students are not going to be stressed about the problem and will complete the task with higher quality.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0

Some people thinks the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology have positive effects on people's lives because technology makes more easy their lives, for example they not need to leave their houses for buy or to joint with another person to play games. However, I think the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology have negative effects because people prefers to shop on online than stores, people use more technology to talk, and also children plays with technology than with another person or toys.

Today, people prefers to shop by online than stores. I saw and lived this experience many times about buy by online but I not feel comfortable as a store.

In my personality, use the phone when you are sharing with another person is not respect and you are not enjoying the moment. The use of phones during a meeting avoid the interaction with other human, and gives negative effects on the people's live.

Finally, children more plays with technology than with another child or toys. In the past, children plays with toys or they made their own toys. This helped to children to developed their imagination or decover their skills. Also, children invented plays involving run, saltar or make force; this plays helped to children to enjoy healthy and socialiting with other child. But today, children prefers to play with technology avoing come out and carring to be lazy, obesity, and addicting to the technology. Children's break times likes to use their phones than talk with their friends or family. They think that interacting with family or friends are old things and that is most enjoy use the phone in their break times. The use of technology for children is a negative affect because they not play or relationing with another people.

On the other hand , some will disagree by saying that if students dont attend actual school they will become lazy and irresponsible. Distance learning will benefit many student and also school.

Distance learning will benefit students in many ways such as better attendance . If students are allowed to attend school while at home it will give them less chances of not attending. Something that students hate most is waking up in the morning to get ready for school.

If students dont attend their actual school there will be less problems. Some students are treated really bad in school , many are bullied , and also many like to be drama queens . However if students attend school at home it will benefit a child because they wont have to see other students and there will be less drama and more education.

BD889A4D831B,"Students have to attend school to learn more efficiently, but long distance learning is not good because you have to take your own notes online ,however, if you were to attend school on regular time, you would not have to worry about taking your own notes. Although, online is still a option because you just need a computer or a laptop to take online classes, and not having to worry about missing the class when the teacher took notes that day. All you have to do for online school or video conferencing is get online and do all your classes, and not worry about getting to school. Students need to go to school instead of online or video conferences to learn more and participate in class or school.

Going to school than taking online classes or video conference is way better because you go to school and actually pay attention and not get distracted of what is around you in school ,however, taking online classes can get you easily distracted when you're at home or a public place trying to do you work and you hear people talking and having conversations all around you. While you're in school you can peacefully finish all your work in class and ask for a question, or even help from the teacher, but if you're taking online classes your only source is most likely going to be a online source, or the guides they give you online which might not be always correct. The information online could be outdated. while the information at school is planned out and ready to be given out by the teacher or staff at school. Even though, everyone would prefer online classes over actually going to school, people should consider going to school for a backup just in case the people taking online classes don't like how it is done. Going to school and learning just for being in class helps you in a lot of ways such as visually, speaking, and self control, however, if you're at home taking online classes it will only help on your visual learning.

Taking online classes can probably be difficult sometimes, because people can forget to take the class the day you need to log in ,however, going to school and knowing which days to go to school is very helpful because you can learn without any problems happening. Although taking classes online and not having to go anywhere and stay where you are is good, you're putting your grades at risk, the computer can malfunction or even be corrupted with a virus on it, and it can slow down your computer or even shut it off every time you need to do your work. This is why going to school is more efficient. The people that go to school have no worries just bring all the materials they need for class and work and pay attention. Also students can have more time to work and can be actively speaking with our teachers too, for questinos and answers to help students. Students need to go to school instead of online or video conferences to learn more and participate in class or school.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0
BF267B42A2A4,"The humanity now in days had been not so good lately, there is many different opinions on how you should do things in life or how you should act. It is well informed that people can be complicated but nobody will said the life will be easy all the time. I think people should start making their own decision because, they can learn about life, have a better understanding on how life works and how to value their-self and be efficient person on their own.

However, there is a big chance that people can tell you how you really should live your life, you have to experienced it in persons there will be a day when you are going to fall or something can happen you are not aware on how life can be so hard and difficult in times. Also mistakes are allow nobody is perfect life will surprise you anytime without you notice it you got to be ready to face it not matter how easy or hard it could be. When you make your owns decision you will be capable of making the right decision for yourself.

Meanwhile, it is hard to understand life sometimes but is part of our daily life and you have to understand how it really works so the way you do not stress out for a simple thing, life gives you challenges that only you as the only responsible of yourself have to face it and all will depends how you take things it will be a result of it. As we grow life will make us stronger or weak it all depends but best choice of making the right thing is that you should be aware that anything can happen without given you a hint it will hit you on the right time or not on the best time you wanted it. Anything that will hurt you will make you strong and that's how you know that your are living life.

Lastly, people might not notice it but if we do not love ourselves nobody will do it, people do have to depend on some else to be happy it's all about you. In addition anything you do will not make others happy you have to learn to do everything on your own because that more efficient you are the more good things in life you will make. Be your own and value every single thing that is around, but remember nothing is easy life can surprise you anytime.

In conclusion, people should start making their own decisions to be aware of what life really is if your learned and have a better understanding about life in a daily routine anything that will happen will not surprise you. Loving yourself will make you love others. Hopefully people will take a note that life is all about you and not others each person has a different thoughts and ways of seen life.

BFB07811C92D,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Some people think that they can control there first impressions at any time that they wanted to, but thats is not right, first impressions are so fast that it does not let you think, or express in a different way they are faster them a second, there are impressions that can be change, but it depends in the situation that you are in, and other can not be change no matter what you do. I agree with this statement, because impressions are an affect, feeling or image retained after an experience.

Some impressions had a really bat affect in our lives, less say there was a time were maybe the only impression that some had was really not the one he wanted, but was the only one he could do, for example let say that there is a student in a classroom, maybe he is not feeling good, and he fart that it makes a realy loud some, and that everyone in the class hear it, his first impression will be to act normal but he could not act normal, because he knows that it was so loud that everyone heard him, so his going to feel shame of him self, his face is going to get red, and his hears and but thats something you can not control.

The feeling that some get at the firs impression is almost like something you don't have every day, well if you have embarrassing moment every time them you may get the wired feeling every day. Went you get the firs impression and is not every day situation is almost all time shame, confusion, uncomfortable, some times pain. But when is a every day thing, them is almost all the time happynes, like the feeling I get went my family ask me embarrassing questions or we have embarrassing moments. Is almos all the time happiness. Because it is a very day thing that they ask me things that it makes me uncomfortable.

The experiences that people get went they have a lot of firs impressions, are so impressive that they can act normal in a lot of situation,

for example went they were use to act embarrass or shame now they are capable to act normal, because of the experience that they had. Like I personable had a lot of experience that now insted of feel shame or embarrass I only get happiness. like went my mom ask me if i had a girlfriend I only smile or answer her that i do not and it is all normal, or at school went my friends ask me if I'm dating the girl I like, the answer I give them is yes or not, like a normal student, I dont get shame or anything. Because I had some experience during my life that it make me feel normal now.

I hope that in the future one day, when someone ask me something embarrass, and make me get a moment when my first impression is shame, or embarrass my feeling don't show up, and my experiences take place, for it not to have more affect in the moment, and make it more embarrassing than what it is already, because I dont want it to make me lost my mine, and make the moment the worst one in my life.

BFB53ACD3DD5,"Have you asked to your-self what might people think about you or what impressions they have about you? That's a hard question to answer, but I guess everybody does it. First impressions not always are positive for our-selfs, it can make you doubt about your-self, look for people's approval, and get a low-esteem. First impression not always come into your life with good intentions.

As first point, first impressions make you overthink what to do and what to say, making you doubt about your-self, and loosing your confidence. Nobody should wonder what others think about them, because each person have their own life and their own problems.

In high schools, mostly the 90% of students look for the approval of their friends. Teenagers are the most affected. Essentially, this teenageers do not have their own life.

In facts, first impressions affect all people but mostly the teenagers. They get a low-esteem, all because the system in what now we life, first impressions.

I remember my first year of high school, I was afraid like a little chicken as we said in my country with no idea what to do or what to say, wonderig what they were thniking about me. There were a few days that I din't want to go to the school because I could felt tha the other students had bad impressions about me.

BFCE7D755436,"Do you think should student to use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes ?

A lot of young people has cell phones that can use for many ways. The young people use their cell phones for text with their family or do their homework, but Today's many kids are going away from people. However, they use the cell phone in bad ways in classroom, so, I believe students should not use the cell phones in class because they could cheat in their exams and get easy score.

The first reason , when the teacher says, ""get out the phone, we are going to start study in our phone"". The students does not care when the teacher is giving the instructions of the topic. A lot of students are going to playing games or listening music and when the teacher ask question about of the topic they would say, ""i do not know' and every body starts to laugh because they were not paying attention in the classroom and their grades is going down.

The second reason,Today's in the world student only put their face in the cell phones. A lot of student use the cell phone for their social media in classes, therefore, Student are not paying attention in class when the teacher is explaining the topic. However, student when the cell phone is allowed to use, they will have more focus in their social media than classes. For example, A lot of student have the famous ""snapchat"" that it is film videos for ten seconds and share in your story for people see them, Student with their cell phones are going to put any video in their story to showing the teacher talking or everybody laughing.

Another reason and is the most important, Student cheat in exams with their cell phones because the teacher says, ""you can use your cell phones in this test"". however, students do not study for any home work or test. they can get a easy score. For example, they know can use the cell phones in test, but this time the teacher says, ""you cannot use the cell phones in this test."" The student are going to get bad scores because they thought that can use the cell phone to get a great score. however, a lot student do not study for any test when they can use the cell phone.

However, The propose of the teacher is that student earn easy information and good scores. The allowed to use the phone has a good way that students can search homework or read a book. Sometimes the teacher gives homework to do at home and you will use your cell phone for solve the homework. For example, students are learning other language and do not know some word in the information gave the teacher, they can use the translate to know the word.

In conclusion, Students should not allowed to use the cell phones in classrom because they are not going to learn anything at the final of year. Allowed to use the cell phone is a disadvantage for students in the futures in their jobs because they were always in their cell phone playing or social media.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
C15EC5707409,"To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours. I do not agree, with this model by extending the school day two hours. I Think my school should not follow this model by extending the school day two hours, because two more hours of school will be very streful for students and students will not have the enought time to do their homeworks after school. On the other hand this would be a big problem for schools.

In first place, I think this will be a big disadvantage for studets who have others responsiblity to do after school. For example, I have a job after school and I need to be there at four oclock, but if my school follow this model I wouldn't keep my job, because school will finish two ahours late and it will be very late for me to go to work. This show, that if school follow this model this really will affect me and not only me- but also other students who, also have to work after school.

Second, two more ahurs of school will be very streful for students, because classes will be longers than what they usually are, so students will get tired and they will not concentrate in what the teacher is saying. Also students will not have the enought time to do their homework after school, becuase they will get very late and tired at home and they will not feel like to do their homework, knowing that they need to rest for the next day of school. With this in mind, students, also will be affecting with their grades, for the reason that they will not turn in their homeworks.

Some say, if schools follow this model by extending the school day two hours, would be a big problem for students attendance because students will not show up to every single day of school, for the reason that they will be tired from the day before of school. Therefore follow this model would not be a good idea to deal with, because attendance is something very important that schools require to students can pass their school year.

In the final analysis, this rutine will not be easy for students to face, even know that there is going to be only for day of school, for me this still not a good idea to agree with. As a student that I am this would affect me in my daily rutine. Students will be very streful and tired during class. This would affect the students attendence which, also will affect their grades.

students could leaen more about sports an be healther and know how to play it other thing is that they can do there homework at school if they cant do it at home or if they have no one at the house to help them.

participate at schools activity something that all school should have and make students have a better guatction in there furcht and help how to become good person later in life.

The most importent thing about participate to school activity is you can spend time with your friend and teacher and your principal too, and it help students with there grades too.

Positive: Everyone know that the technology can be like a friends for the people how like use all day like example, communicating with friends or families who live far away. but the techonoly permitted the people use like a tool like find books, or shop things which you can find in a mall or places where you like to go. In others words technology has a impact in the society, examples, help people to find jobs without need to go out and walk in the streets for a job or students need go a college and ask for information or when a people need to shop things without that the person need to go far away. something techonoly have a advantage when you have problems with you live everyone always looking for games which help to clear you mind or when have problems with buildings of your home.

Negative:In others words the techonoly always like show the good face but no one talk about the second face which can be a weapon for yourself or people who live around you. because when you find a page where you look everything good like safe, but you never now who create this page or for what him create that. In many occasion the people use technology for things bad like examples, groups terrorist which use technology with a idea to be close with adolescence for invited to be in the groups of terrorist and something that pass with adolescence which have fathers that dont care what yours children make. In others occasion the technology is like a tool, because people like use a lot time for Facebook o buy something in that, but l we know some people use that like a weapon like use for sell fake things and take the money from people who think they are stupid.

C31C0ED2A05C,"For the pass few years students have been using cellphones more often than the last 15 years; is when cellphone just started to be an essential apart of our daily life and during that time cellphones were not allow to use in the classroom , but times have change and now students are allow to use their cellphones in the classroom. In this essay I want to answer a question ""What are the effects of allowing students to have and use cellphones in the classrooms?"".

When cellphones were allow to use in the classroom at first there was a lot of benefits for example: it became easier for teachers and students to do their work, for students it became more easier to find information about a topic by using their cellphones instead of using a computer because sometimes there is not enough computers for every student, for teacher by allowing students to use cellphones in the classroom the teachers they could find better ways to do a class work by using a app that it might not be possible to use in a computer, but obviously nothing can be that perfect by allowing students to use their cellphone in the classroom there was a downside many students started to irresponsibly using their cellphones in the classroom. For example using a cellphone when the teacher is explaining a subject, using your cellphone to distracted others during the class period, etc.

Does were some examples of the good and bad effects of allowing students to use their cellphones in the classroom.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0
C38334385924,Their are some schools that offer to attend online classes or video conferencing what if they don't have a computer at home for to be able to use it for the online class. Some parents will not agree I think because they will be working and they don't know with who they can leave their kids with. Video Conferencing could work for students instead of online classes because that way the person that will come to teach you can explain more better from the assignments that your suppose to do. Some students just prefer someone to teach them for they can help with what they are doing. Students will benefit from being abkle to attend classes from home will some students they would rather take classes home then school because in school they think it's more harder for them for the reason of being with alot of stusdents. They like to work alone quite and with someone who can have patients and work slowly and have time. Same thing with there schedule when you have classes at home you can choose the time and day that you want to do the class.             ,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5

I strongly agree with what has been said ""a positive attitude is the key in to success in life"". Attitude is sign off telling or showing who you are without expressing yourself. Our positive attitude is what makes our dream come through. Positive attitude attracts wherever you want to do. For instance, working as a bartender is a great opputtunity to earn rewards. Approaching customers with a positive attitude and treating them right, makes you tips. And that person will pleased to work with you if he or she has a company or running some business.

C41DFE052637,"Imagine someone is doing the same skill that he already has mastered, he is going to stay in the same place. He will never grow. One reason why doing different things can help someone grow is by being stronger in other things. Being able to learn new skills can improve your ability. Someone can even find out if they are good at other things that they probably never thought they would be good at. Is the best to try to do new things than staying in the same place and never growing.

First reason, why doing different things can help someone grow is by being stronger in other things. Being stronger in other things can really put you to the top where you never thought you could be at. When getting stronger at other things it could make someone the best athletic person or the best person that is strong in so many things. When being strong or good at things, you can even help your friends if they are struggling. Once you become a strong person are you going to be able to do anything.

Next, being able to learn new skills can improve your ability. Learning new skills can help someone out a lot. When doing a lot of new things it can make someone a healthier person. Someone is going to start realizing their improvement and once they start seeing results, they are going to start getting motivated even more. When someone knows so many skills, they could probably teach another person that wants to be like you. Is a great thing to be able to improve your ability.

Finally, someone can even find out if they are good at other things that they probably never thought they would be good at. Finding things that someone never knew they could do will make someone pretty shocked. When someone finds out more things that they are able to do, it can help them join in more activities. The people that can do more, they have a better advantage because they can do more that others can't do. Its pretty shocking that there are people that don't know that they could do something that they never thought they could do.

In this essay, I will argue about the important role failure plays in people success. people that become success is because they have failure a lot of time during the process, and they work harder each time to do it better.

When someone success in something, they had failure in something one time in their career. Maybe the fail they took in their career is what make them successful. They knew, if they dont work harder they wouldn't do any better. A failure can teach you lessons to do better that last time. That why a lot of people said that never gave up just for a fail that you can have. Thats what make a person successful.

Failure is something that all of us do. Thats what make us do better in life. If we all ignore are failure, we would keep failing over and over. That why we have become successful in something in are life. For example, when I was 10 years old, i couldn't ride a bike. I away fail trying to ride it, but i never stop trying. I try doing different way to learn. My success of riding a bike was based on failure that teach me different way to learn something and better.

My dad have a company that he have work hard and a lot to archive what he have now. He never loss his enthusiasm to make his company better, years over years. All the knowledge that my dad have now is by the failure. Sometimes he have lost a lot of money, or work for free, because he din't do what the customer said. Some times was because the customer din't like the work.

Now he know that he should do the work as the customer said and do the work better. He have learn that he should do what his job more better and do what the customer said.

Some people said that you don't need a failure to become successful, but they are wrong. Success comes from failure that make you have knowledge. All the failued that you took make you work harder and do way better. In the future, I hope people learn more from their failure to be successful in what they want to archive in their life.

C61946131A41,"Identifying a career at a young age.

Identifying a career at a young age may be difficult for some students ,most of them think different ,some of them doesn't even care about their future or what they are going to do with their life ,parents may think this is a good idea because they want a good life and good future for their childrens and want them to be successfull and this will change their perspective of thinking.

Although some people think that this idea is a bad idea , and this is going to be hard for students,because the students are going to have more homework,projects,test to get prepared for their career and some quizzes too,Actually people this days is use to only if the students gratuated and get out of school is when they have to start thinking on what the students want to do or work , for example if students finish high school and they start to work in a regular work like a restaurant,they may think i'm already here working good ,I get pay good ,why would I go to school again,I don't need to go school again just to spend money ,I'm good like that just getting my own money to wasted only for me,and this would be the way he is thinkg because when he was in high school; people didn't talk to him about careers when he was at school.

One reason for start identifying what students want at a young age is because they would have a lot of time to think what they really want in their life ,for example if a student is in 9 grade and he says I want to be a police and then he is in 11 grade and he think different and he wants to be a doctor,he would a chance to change his career because he had time to do it , another example i can give if like what is a student want to start knowing how his career work, like the doctor career he may wanna know how much credits he need to make in high school , how many years his career is going to take ,if he is going to have the opportunity to go collage, would he be able to pay his career,that's why is a good idea to start thinking at a young age,and start to getting prepare for what he is going to do in his career.

Another reason for start thinking what the students want in their life,is that they may know on what they are good at,to know their self,and start to think if they are going to be successfull in their future ,they may start doing good in high schoool to do credits and try to get a scholarship ,for example the student finish high school and he is going for his career maybe a doctor and at the middle of his preparation for being a doctor he saids I'm not good at this and this career is not going to a successfull for me I would only give up a this point , he may think this way because he didn't have opportunity to change what he wannted to change ,why? because the school start to talk about this when he was in 12 grade and he did have change to think well,he didn't have chance to change his way of think ,another example I can give is that some students like latinos students , some of them doesn't have a good economical life and this may be hard forsome of them on finishing their career ,so they have to start getting credits ,start to get good grades to get a scholarship, Because most of the latinos students want to be successfull in their ife and this would work for them ,Identifying want students want for their future at a young age is good ,because they know what they really want and this really work

In conclusion ,Identifying a career at a young age is good because the students will have they time to know what they really want ,and to know on what they are good at,and start to do good at high school for they to graduated,the students will have more opportunities in their life is they choice a good career for their life , this is a plan that would change the way how students think;young students think better and very clear and this may guide them toward a specific career in their life.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0

C652190DB53F,"Working alone is more beneficial than working with a group. People can work relax and calm without being interrupted, and no one has to ask other people opinion, and also people are shy , they might don't like being surrounded by other people. On the other hand, working with a group can be good, because everyone can share ideas. However working alone is much better.

Work is already stressful, and work with people talking and giving opinion about the job is worse. Imagine a work where the whole group is speaking and there is someone stressed, this person won't be able to work relax and think about new ideas, probably when the person get home, it will be more stressed than someone who worked alone and quiet. Being alone make any person relax, and once you're relax no one can stop it, the ideas come to your mind.

During doing the work, might suddenly appear a new brilliant idea, and with a group the proposal is check with them and see if everyone agrees, and it spend time, and also might happen that not everyone agreed. Working alone can gain time, because people can use the time they're asking the group to work more instead of asking someone opinion. Also it creates discussion, more and more people speaking at the same time, disagreements and agreements, wasting time, and making people confused. Then it is better work alone to gain time working instead of asking, everyone does your own work.

Being surrounded by a lot of people might be hard for shy people. For example, I'm shy, and work in group for me is a struggle, have to talk to other person, have to share my ideas, I can't do my work relax, I can't either think about anything. The impression caused is that people will look at your work and judge it, and won't agree, and there I'm, needing to do everything again, in most of the times I don't even show my own work I just agree with other people work. It is not good, the brain doesn't work how it was supposed to work, people looking and may judging, all of it might collaborate for a terrible work.

Some people might say that work together people could share ideas and open the door to new opportunities, of course share ideas is a good point, see every point of view. However working alone has much more benefits, is better to have a good time working, without stress than share ideas and get home stressed and full of everything.

Working alone in a peaceful place, just you and your thoughts, to think about everything, every point, to analyze all things, relax and calm, whitout being shy or stressed. It is the benefts that everyone needs to have.                   ",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5

C7CE778367F6,""" Why stay home bored out of your mind when there are enjoyable ways you can spend outdoors? ""

I think outdoors activities are more enjoyable then indoors activities because you can spend more time with family, spending more time exploring the world, and take time away from all those electronic devices. Being outdoors provides a wide variety of interesting ways to enjoy being outdoors for example going to the park where there awesome activities for the kids and parents, taking a stroll outside with you dog or family, and it can also be a stress reliever.

First, Family is important, and spending more time with family is important, because it allow you to get to know them. For example your mom and dad work really hard to affords all the stuff you need and you and your brothers and sisters are barely able to see them. On Saturdays and Sundays are the only time your able to see them and have quality time with them but you are to busy in your room chatting with friends a d doing your homework, but all you have to do is take a break and spend time with them. Going to the park with them , walking around, talking have a nice conversation without a rush, joking around are ways you can spend time with family. Having fun at a carnival or festival with your family, eating hot dogs, cotton candy , riding fun rides, you might even find your cousins there and also spend time with them. All of these are enjoyable ways you can spend with your family outdoors.

Secondly, spending more time with the outside world is an amazing experiences because it allows you to discover all the amazing living creatures, food, cultures, countries , other ways other people live, etc. It can be very enjoyable to explore for example you can go to South Africa there are amazing food, animals if you go to the zoo its amazing, and fun to do with family or friends or even alone. Exploring can also be fun you can go out meet people you can go to book fairs, concert from your favorite bands or singers, try out different restaurant, try something crazy like jumping from a cliff and going into the river, swimming with sharks or dolphins, you can meet people who might be with you your whole entire life, have connections with them, visiting a museum, a aquarium. There are fun ways you can explore the world with all these outdoors activities.

Thirdly, spending time away from electronics helps enjoys quality times with other for examples your family, friends,and it helps be more focus in school and homework. Humans have tendency to procrastinate and be like

"" oh i'm going to do my homework and this or that tomorrow I have so much stuff to do""

but at the same time stay on there phone for hours. Some people cant even have a decent conversation with family or spend time outdoors with their brothers and sister because they are too busy on their phone for hours. Parks, museums, and other places have good outdoors activities that helps humans stay away from technologies. There and millions of ways you can enjoy outdoors activities without being on your devices.

In conclusion, going to the park with your family and spending time together, visiting different countries, taking time away from your phone, and enjoying all the beautiful things this earth has, are enjoyable ways you can spend outdoors, all of the activities can also be a stress reliever, going to the park with your cousin and sibling are fun to do and are enjoyable time outside .",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

One reason, why I love Korea as much is beacuse of the food. The food in Korea is so tasty for example the korean BBQ (Barbeque). Korean BBQ'S is where everyone sits down at a table order some raw meat, they also get some side dishes like to go with it. Once they get the raw meat they cook it have ever they want, in the small grill in the mibble of the table. Kimchi is another type of food that I like beacuse it's spicy and I love spicy foods. But the best part adout the food in Korea is the street food beacuse it's so cheap but yet so tasty that I could die for it.

Another reason, is the beautiful places in Korea. Visiting the Han River a great first place to go when you get to Korea. Han River has lots of beautiful pink bloosom tree's which are great for taking photograghs. Generic_City is a city that is very populated with people. Generic_City is just like California here in the United State beacuse it's where all the famous people live at. The best part of Generic_City is the performances beacuse you get to see so many talented people show off there skills with rapping, dancing, and singing. The beaches in Korea are a great place for families to have bonding time together, especially in Busan.

Finally, the best part is ""me time"" which means I can get time for myself. Decent hotels are really hard to find but every single hotel in Korea looks amazing from the inside and from the outside. Every single thing in the hotel in is clean beacuse korean people don't like to be messy they love to be organized. The relaxition spa's are great, to have some ""me time"" they do foot massages, faciaul treatment and more. Yoga is even more relaxing then anything else beacuse it helps your mind conitrait and balance its self in order to distress. These are the main things I suggest you to do if you want to realease the stress and have some ""me time"".

In conlusion, I suggest you to take a trip to korea. One, is beacuse the food is great, especially the street food. Second, it have the most amazing places to visit like Han River. Last but not least, is the relaxation time i can get for myself. Well its time for me to catch a flight to korea. I hope i see you there too.

When they talk to each other they can learn more about the other person like they can know what they like or what they don't like. So they can learn a lot from each other. It mean that when you make friend it can help the smaller kids.

It can help the smaller kid because they can uderstand better about the lesson because they know then if they don't understand something someone is gonna to help them to understand. They can say their opinion because ththe older and smaller student do not have a lot of different age like could have 4 or 5 years old more then tem so that is not a lot, so it can be easyer to the small kid to explain you what their opinion is. They can also ask a question when they want because sormely they have to wait that the teacher is finish an other student to ask the question but if there are also older student which alredy do the lesso you can ask them your question. The work by different age help the small kid but it can also help the old kid.

It can help the old kid because it help them to stay calm to do not be in stress, because with small kid you have to dpeak slow and do not be angry because they do not understand you are saying.

The best example is when AiDiSheng developed light blob he had thousands of fails but he didn't give up, he didn't loss enthusiasm,after more fails finally he made the first light blob in human life. It tells me If you don't loss your enthusiasm on something thing you focus on keep doing it you will done it perfectly like what you wished.

My other reason is be audacious keep trying. when you are failure to failure, your friends might say stop doing it you are not going to make It .they just giving you a suggestion.

If you stop you will loss your enthusiasm on something that is attracting you just because they said are not going to make it, trust yourself keep trying don't loss your enthusiasm.

In my opinion enthusiasm is not easy to have, the only ways to have Is someone or something that is attracting me. I would like to focus on I will have enthusiasm like video games I can play for a whole day,but I can't study for whole day It will be tough to me what If I have enthusiasm on study I will be success too.

Fail is not dreadful, the awful thing is loss enthusiasm that will be incurable. Believing yourself even you have many fails continue trying you will be succeed.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0

C968149003DE,"So many people at my middle school want to start a after school homework club and this because studies have shown that one way to improve student achievement is to start a homework club. Well I think this idea is not going to work because student will think that they will only have to do homework at the homework club therefor when there no after school most kids won't turn in there homework. Also another problem is the volunteer work no kid wants to stay after school to help and if there only teacher I am certain that kids would lose focus. And the subject I

don't think that 45 minute Are enough to learn 4 main class plus the homework that's not enough time to finish homework and learn.

And many people just want to go to this homework club just to finish fast I think that people that really need it should be in this group not just cause they want to finish fast they can do that at home and after school wasting time and the teachers time. This one of the main problems I have with the homework club is that if kids go there they are only go to fool around with there friends. And not let other kids learn and do there homework and learn being a middle school er my self I have seen how most kids with there friends u would think that they are mauter but not as much. But many people say maybe if you let them they will change but so many people have goin't chances but they keep doing the same thing.

As a conclusion I think that this after school program has no use because homework is called homework for a reason and if u do at school they would not do at home when there's no after school so this after school program will not work for many reason like no a enough time not enough focus distractions. And people who just want ot play and not do work and volunteering kids dont want to stay extra and kids won't pay anttion to the teacher. ",3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0

CA10EA3EB6FD,"A problem Is a chance for you to do your best.

Did you know that problems are a chance for you to do your best.

Problems builds up strength on you. They also show you to not repeat the past. Hard times like problems help you to keep your head up and never give up on a hard war.

A problem is a chance for you to do your best. My problems opened up so many chances for me to do my best in life. Problems will always have a chance for you, so you can do better in your life. Never lose that one chance in life. Those chances will not come back and you will regret not taking the chances. I took a chance to live with my mom and now I am happy with her.

Hard problems make you build up strength on yourself. When my father abandoned me and my sisters, it build up strength on me and my sisters because, we had to learn that are father is not always going to be there when we want him to be there and we have learned that we don't need a father for everthing and we can do it by ourselfs. I can't lie I really miss him and I really wish I could give him a big hug. All that is left are the good memories I made with him. I will never forget him and will always love him beause he is my father. All the tears I have cried over him have build up strength on me and thought me to never give up and keep fighting even if it is hard for me.

Hard issues show you to not repeat the past and do better then the past. My hard problems have showed me to not repeat the past and to do better then the past because, I would always try to give up on everything and always put a negitive thinking to my problems. This has showed me when you try to give up you are showing yourselfs and others that you are weak and can't handel it. It has also showed me to never put a negitve thinking and put a positive thinking, because if you but a negitive thinking everything could come up negitive and you will always try to give up if everything comes out negitive. Always put a positve thinking and everything will come out positive and you will feel motivated to keep fighting.

Really hard problems help you keep your head up and learn to never give up on a really hard war. When my father was so mean to me I would always put my head up and not let the mean words get me down. To never give up and show him and the haters that I am stronger and better. When i cried because my mom was not with me and my father would not let me see her that showd me that my head was up all ready because I fighted to be with her. I have turned all my haters into my motivators, because I wanted to show them that I can do it . Always keep your head up high and never down because, keeping it down won't help at all.

A problem is a chance for you to do your best. They are also helpful for you in your life because, they make you strong, so when you have an other problem it won't hurt you as much. Never give up of your problems, whatever problem you or your familly are going through never give up, because if you give up you won't be able to go to the past and change up everything that you gave up on. All those hater will always want to see you crying,mad, and sad and they also want you to feel like a big losser, all those haters turn them into your motivators, don't let them put you down. Stay strong and never forget that you are better, and stronger then that problem. Never feel bad that you showed the haters that you can do it. Always have a smile on you face, my mother told me ''even if you are upset always have a smile because, you have to smile to the hard world you are in.""

CA73BDEC2752,"I disagree with what John Lubbock saids ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I strongly disagree because we are influnced by the people we hang out with. Like for example in America we have diferent accents all around the map and thats because the people near us influnce one another. They influnce one another by sharing cultures and beliefs. For example in louisiana they have martigra but it did not originate in louisiana, in new york they have a lot of italian people, and we all enjoy eating ethic food such as chinese food, tacos, pupusas, italian food. All of those things influnced americans and their traditions and customs which impacts thier morals.

As we all know everyone has morals but those morals are influnced by people, such as our friends, family, teachers and coworkers. Ones morals has a big role in character. I would even say its the biggest factor in what builds pur character. A persons moral is what tells them what is right and what is wrong, what they should do or what they should not do, wether to pick option A or option B. Morals are a part of someones character, its what builds thier charater. For example if someones morals aren't made up and they do not know what is good and bad then thier character might need some work.

I get where Mr. Lubbock gets the idea of ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it"" but I also think that social class has alot to do with your character. I think that the different social groups have a varaity of character building factors. I believe this because for example a person that only makes 20 grand a year has a lot more struggles than a person that makes 100 grand a year and those struggles impact ones character.

In conclusion I disagree with John Lubbock because I believe morals, social class and people around us influnce our character. I believe all those factors play a major role on who we are because it is human nature to adapt to surroundings. ",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0

Some people are not able to help others, because they don't the right mind set as others. Last reason why talking to more than one person too seek for multiple opinions and make better is helpful because people need someone too talk too and get ideas from. If someone is sad or they need help with problems that happen in their life. They need too find someone that can help them and seek for multiple opinions.

For instance i think that if you develop new ideas from the help of more than one person can be helpful in so many ways. One way is if you talk to the right person you will actually be able too get a good job in the future. Second reason why talking to more than one person too seek for multiple opinions and make better choices and it will develop new ideas is because people will be able to get new opinions and for information to help them with their career. How ever theres many reasons why you can be able to develop new ideas.

If you wanna talk to someone about seeking for multiple opinions and making better choices. You need to find the right person. There are people that can lie about so many things. People like this can ruin so many careers and dreams from people. They do not have the right mind sets of others. Thats why you should find the right people too seek new opinion from.

Another activity that can be fun and cool and enjoyable is playing an insturment. It is fun because i used to play an insturment the last three years and it was fun because you get to go to trips.

It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change, I think that it is true. There is no second impression, once is enough to show the kind of person that you are. There are three reasons why I agree. I will not be the person that no one would like to believe in, I will not get help from anyone, and I will not have friends.

To begin with, I will become the person that no one would like to believe in. For example, if I show myself as a liar at the first impression, everyone will know that I am not the one or the incorrect person to believe in. Even though I am saying the truth no one would trust me, but the first impression can change it. My mom told me that doing the best since the begining will help me the rest of my life. She was right because of what she thought me, and I apply it in my life I see myself as the person who you can believe in.

Secondly, I will not get help from anyone. In my life I will need help from others because I am not able to do everything by myself. That's why I should make people to see me as a helpful person at the first impression, otherwise I will not get help. I heard someone said that ""what I give to others is what I will recieve back from them"".

What I understood is that if I do not help others, they will not help me. I always like to be the kind of person that help without waiting something back. I think that it makes my impression as a good one.

Finally, I could lose friends or I would not have any friends what is even worst. Since the first time when I

met my friends and showed them that I am the type of person or friend that is always with them no matter what. Furthermore, I have never betreyed one of them but if I've would did it when we met, they already kick me out of their life. As I said before one of the things that can make me the best friend is my first impression, show them that I am loyal.

In conclusion, first impressions are almost impossible to change. However, you can change them but it takes a long time and you will lost your patience waintig until it change. That's why giving a good first impression will prevent problem for you such as; to not become the person that no one would like to belive in, to not get help from others, or to not have friends.

Failure is always there, a lot of times we thing failure is a bad thing, but failure is a key thing for success, it will prepare you efor even much harder situations, if you don't fail how are you going to progress?, fail and mistakes help you learn from them, help you to become stronger and they let you know that things are not easy. You have to put more effort on the things you want to get and mistakes are just there to help your progress.

Sometimes we just need different ways to solve problems and failure is there for us, when you fail you know what you are not going to do next, it give you choices and failure let you know the things you could've done to avoid it. When I started to play soccer, I didn't know how to kick the ball correctly, because I only knew one way to kick the ball, I failed a lot of times, but i didn't give up, I started to kick the ball in different ways, I placed my foot in different positions to kick the ball with more power or if wanted to kicked it with more precission. All those fails helped me to realized that there were many other ways and not only one way.

Failure also makes you stronger, because when you fail and you are beaten down and you go there even stronger and achieve what you wanted to achieve you are a new person, a new and strong person that doesn't give up for a simple mistake, a person that when everything looks like its over, comes back with more confidence to not make the same mistake again, that mistake helped you to become even stronger than what you were before it.

Edison was asked ""How does it fell to fail 100 times?"", and he answered, ""I didn't failed, the light bulb was a proyect that took 100 steps to be done"".

In conclusion, failure and mistakes help you learn from them, failure gives you other ways to accomplish your goals and it makes you stronger than what you were before, I think people shouldn't be afraid of failure, they have to start failing, because when they get to reach their goals, their satisfaction when they achive it, its going to be even bigger.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

The attitude can help people life, because when you are going to ask for a application to get an employment, if you are thinking negative things, nothing is going to be positive to you.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5
CCC05B237877,"Your attitude is the best way to achieve your goals or just a plus to get everything easily. In life if your attitude is pleasant you will have a lot of opportunities, and also be succesful in work, love, and friends. For example if you help your partners in work, and do your work well probable your boss prometed you in a better stand for all your effort and devotion. Another example can be in love if you are affectionate, charismatic, and loving probably you gonna find someone love you and give you the same love, and actitud you have with her.

To begin with, the best way to get a best position in your work is to show a good attitude. The majority of contrators like someone everyone loves too, because is more effective to everyone and effective for the company. For example last year in my uncle work someone will be ascent, 3 workers inclued my uncle, the most part vote for him because they said is the most friendly, and the most appropiate for the jod. To conclude this if your attitude like the others everyone wiil be agree with you and they going to follow you because they trust you.

Secondly, the best manner to be in love with your partner is havening a great attitude, and communication. The most part of relationship work, because both respect each other, and have a great communication. For example my Mom and my Dad never fighting they prefer talk and solve them problems and teach me how is not necessary have a load attitude to solve a problem. This show how have a good attitude is the best way to prevent the love gone and preven divorces.

Some people say, is not always neccesary have a good actitud to be succesful in life. A lot porcent of people think have a bad attitude is a caracteristic to be succesful and is not a obstacle to have a great career in the future. For example the president of my country his attitude is disagreeable but he has a faultless career and although he is likeable is the president of El Salvador. However everyday people say ''he is the president because we need him no because we want he lider us''. This demostrate how you can have a good career or power, but if your attitude is unpleasant although they need it never gonna like you.

People with good personality and good attitude have the benefit to get everything more easy for how you expresed to others. And people who have a weird attitude no matter what they said if they sttil have that attitude and don't chance people never gonna try have a friendship with them for this reasons. In conclusion be a person charismatic a great friendship with the most part of the people your life will be benefit and different just to have a good attitude. ",3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5
CCDD77656701,"Do you thing that most danger of us lies not setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark? Sometimes is not good to tell others what you want because some of them may not want good things for you to get or have, you want to not used too much you phone, you want to loose some weight, and you want to graduated from high school.

Today in day many people used their phone a lot and sometimes they don't do things because they spend most of their time on their phones. For example, you get home from school and you have to do some homework, but you don't want to do it yet because you just got home from school, and you tell your self that you will relax for a few hours, and then you will start to do your homework. You ate dinner and everything you go to your room and one of your friends ask you if you want to play videos game? you tell your self I will play a little bit and then I will start to do my homework. Two hours pass by and you are still playing videos games. You tell your friend I must stop playing because I have to start doing my homework and your friend tells you don't go, we ask someone to give us copy, and you say yes, because you want to continue do keep playing. When you get to school you don't have any body to ask to give you copy. It was your choice to keep playing. That day you make a plant you put a timer and when that timer stop you will stop doing what you are doing. It work because when you time your self you can do more than one thing, you could also have more time to just play but the good thing is you have finish all you things.

For new year resolution you say that you will loose some weight this year. Your family laugh at you because you had said that almost every year and you have not do it. Sometimes is good to just tell your self to do things and don't tell anyone because some people don't want others to get things because they want to get it first and if they don't get it. Those kind of people don't want others do get it also. If you want to loose weight just do it and don't tell any body because you don't know what others want for you. It's better to do things in secret because at the end you are the one you are doing it and no body is helping you. The things that you do are for you not for everyone. When you have your things you can tell to your closer people and some of them may be happy for you and some may not, but that doesn't have to worry you because you have already do your thing and they can't do nothing to take that away from you. Your family may see you that you say things but you don't do it. You have to show them that you can do things that you say. You may feel sad because of what people say and you just have that in your mint. That is why not good to tell everyone of what you want to do because they may be jealous and they don't want you to be in a very good shape. Just go and workout and when they see you again they will say wow you look different what did you did to look great; they will not see you as a lair because you show them that you can do things. It can take time to see the different but you are doing it.

When you are in school you will have friends that are good for you and also those that are not. When you are in high school you want to pass all your classes so you can make your parents proud and they can be happy; but their will be some friends that will tell you to go out and have fun etc. In school their will be students that care about classes and their will be that they don't care. You want to be with those friends that help each other to have good grades. Their will be friends that don't like you and want to get you in some trouble, and they will want you to don't have good grade and be like them. You want to be with friends that support each other. Also you don't want to be that kind of person that say you have good grade and you don't have those good grades and you just are copying others and when it's test time you don't know what to do because you didn't do the work by your self. To get things that you want; you have to work for it. It's better to have friends that help each other and that also that help you to do your work and can be easy for you to also help others.

People may disagree with this because they have good people around them and that they help each other. They may say this because they haven't go through things like; one of your friends don't like you and they don't want you to have the things you want. Sometimes is better to do things and don't tell everyone because you don't know what people really want for you or what they think of the things you want. In this world are people that they don't care what you, they will agreed with what you do and if you felt they always be with you, their is those that they don't want you and others to be happy. The best thing to do is just do things and when you have it tell to everyone that you want because when you already have it they can just talk bad things of you and you don't stay in front of them as a looser because you didn't they don't know how you did it. Us human been we always have the thing inside of us that always make us jealous for what others have. For example, If one of your friends have a news phone you will get a little bit jealous because you also want to have that phone. Every single person in this world has when through that. That's why people don't trust each others.

It's better to do things that no body know because if you felt or don't get what you want, their will not be people that knew. You didn't get it and they will not be talking bad things of you or look at you as a looser that you can't do anything. You will be the only one that will know and if you want to tell them you can it will be your choice. You want to do things because you want to be proud of yourself and that is the only thing it counts.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5
CD81F6CCE819,"I believe that self-esteem comes from achievement because the more a student work hard, the more achievements he/she get so when they receive more awards and/or achievements, it makes them to proud of their selves and build true self-esteem.

There are so much students who works hard, complete their work on time and also have a part time job after school, but they don't know how to build their true self-esteem so what they need to work is that they must be self confident because they can't build their self-esteem unless they're self confident.

Also, there are much more students who go to school and don't have a job or anything after school or during weekend and they're self confident, but don't know how to build their self-esteem.

So, students should try their best to receive achievements because it encourages and/or makes them to build their self-esteem.

Self-esteem is something that students can build it by theirsleves if they work hard, be punctual at school and have a checklist or a plan for what they should do first as a calender.

Students aren't working hard nowadays I have no idea that it's because technology makes them lazy or they don't want to plus they're not trying to achieve something at school.

I'm sick and tired of seeing these kind of students because if they just open their school backpack and at least study for two hours at home, they will receive a lot of achievements at school so that's how they can achieve their goals.

So, when it comes to build their true self-esteem, they need to work on achievements and become self confident first and then best version of their selves.

Teachers also have a role in this issue because I think students spend more time with their teacher compare to their parents in a week.

I don't mean teachers discuss with them to build either their self-esteem or self confidence unless the student is smart and curious to ask his/her teachers and peers about becoming like a person who has self confidence and already built his/her self-esteem.

But, at least they show students the right way to get achievements or achieve their goals so that would be enough, and students will start thinking about how to get achievements and then they'll probably start working on their self confidence and self-esteem.

In addition, when I came to the united states it was 2017, I didn't know any English and I didn't have any friends at school so everybody knows how hard it is to go to school and can not speak with anyone or don't have friends plus I was a shy guy.

When somebody was trying to talk to me, my face was becoming red and start blushing so it's all because I didn't have self confidence.

So, I am still trying my very best to learn the language and make some friends at school so I can play or do my work with them together.

That being said, now I can speak, write and read very well and I became so much more confidence, best version of myself, have a lot of friends, and so happy to attend school.

Overall, being self confident and working hard for achievements are like a key for building students self-esteem which comes from achievements.

Students should focus at school or wherever else they study so they get achievements which helps them to build their self-esteem.

Students also should be encouraged by their parents to build their self-esteem as well as by their selves unless they're self confident in life.                                                                            ",3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,4.0
CD9FDD5F9F9E,"Does failure play a big role in success? Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that, ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Although failure often just ends up in failure, I agree with Winston Churchill's statement that failure can lead to success if people continue to use enthusiasm.

First of all, many of our inventions used today are a result of failures.

For example, Edison created the lightbulb, but failed many times before he discovered electricity.

He used his faith and motivation to not give up and keep trying even though he had many set backs.

He accidently made a circular shaped like glass ball which became a source of electricity. If Edison did not keep trying, we would not have electricity today. Also, many scientists have created medicines after many failed attempts.

For instance, there is now a chicken pox shot that prevents people from getting the chicken pox.

Through many experiements with mixure of chemicals and failed trials, scientists were eventually able to find a shot that prevents chicken pox from entering your system. These examples show that failures often lead to success if people never give up trying.

Second of all, many students have failed in school, but if they keep trying and keep their enthusiam, they will succeed. For example, I have had a hard time in school, especially with passing my sol's. When time goes on, I try harder and harder, and spend more time studying with my teacher.

As of today, I have passed all of the sol's I need in order to graduate except for the one I am writing about right now.

I also have a learning disability and ADHD and have a hard time paying attention and often lose focus in my classes.

Even with my disability, I have not given up and keep coming to school and get extra help from my teachers so that I can graduate this year.

I make sure I follow the rules, don't skip class, or don't miss school becuase it's so hard for me to make up what I miss. Although many seniors like to skip class, I do not skip becuase I want to earn a high school diploma. Even in education, there are failures, but through hard work and a good attitude, students can succeed.

In conclusion, I agree with Chruchill's statement ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of entusiasm.""

Even though people will experience failures, there will be success if they work hard, keep the enthusiiasm, and never give up. ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5.0
CDAA99F49D42,"My prompt say that district school offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. Some students wanna do online class and night school to help them graduate and get there GPA for there classes for college. Do students do online classes and night school right now? Tutoring and and night classes and can help with everything you need in college.

Students that graduate early helps you to get ready for college. This helps all the opportunity for them to understand the learning. The classes you do to understand all the things that happen in each course to help out all. For example, I know a lot of people that that do classes in the morning and at night time to catch all the work for the classes they hard. The more work you get done during summer it counts your GPA scores. Doing everything done with work at school can get ready for everything to be done.

Do students do online classes and night school right now? If so, how do students get it done with all the activity and what programs they do to make it done. Some school offer programs for students to help them with there grading and work they make during the past school year. I remember all the year that I did all my best for high school I've done after school tutoring and morning tutoring to just get everything done so I can just graduate and help my family. This oppoturniy graduating early helps me get ready for school.

Classes in school is hard because they helping you out to get ready for college, because when you enter college its very different than in high school because all the oppotunity you can make for your self. Being orgizinize with all the work you do in school can help you with all the work you will do in college this is you being independent for everything you do in high school because teacher's helping you out. For me being a high school students all the elective classes I do helps me with the course I'm taking in college and doin online classes was the best way to get it done.

Programs you make in school and trying to be in it will help you with all the work you have. Early gradutes, yes, there's alot of them in the country to just get there education done with everything. Colleges do look at your scores and work you do with all the information you do in school all the records and everything. Having good grades and always in school that's one of the records to make college look at you and be like I want her to know to be in my college.

I will say that offer programs from different school you can get accept with all this around you because this can help you out with all the career you do in high school. Graduating three years instead of four years you can get everything done. That's why students graduate early.

Since i started to be more positive in my life, everything was looking better, i found the job that i wanted, i bought my first car, and, me and my family move to a new house, overall everything was looking better. Based on my experience people should be positive and be around positive people, listen to positive music and found activities that incorporate positive attitude.

People should find new friends that give good vibes and help them become a better person, because sometimes the problem might not be themselves , might be people thats around you telling bad stuff, and always making you a have a bad day.

Changing the music that you listen to, could help you be more positive, because most of the songs and artists that most people listen to these days, sign about, drugs, killing people, gang related stuff, and thats good if you want to be positive.

Founding activities that incorporate positive attitude could help also, like going to church, going to the movies with the family, or going to a motivational speeches, will get you into a positive mood and forget about all those negative stuff going on in your life.

Being positive is good, and it makes you feel good and have success in life, but not always is good, because, life sometimes is unfair and we have to deal with it, we cant be leaving thinking that everything is good, when the reality is that the world is getting worst and worst everyday.

In summer we go to different places with my family, we like to travel, we go to crazy water parks, museums, and we go to the zoo sometimes. when you're in school you don't get a lot of time to spend with your family. because you get busy doing your homework and studying.

I have asked people for guidance on decisions i remember i asked my old teacher if i should move to the U.S or stay in my country Generic_City. He told me that it would be better to move to the U.S because i would have more chances of being successful over there than staying in Generic_City and that i would have a better life too and that was one of the hardest decisions i have ever made in my life because i was leaving friends and family behind and i didn't want that to happen.

I have been asked for help before, my friend one day she called me and asked me to help her on her relationship i could tell that she needed help and guidance i could her it in her voice they got into this argument and she told me that it wasn't the first time they have argued before and she told me that it got to this one point that it made her cry so i told her that she needs to break up with him and that he wasn't good for her and if she keeps dating him the argument's could get worse what if he starts getting violent with her and stuff. I told her that it's going to be hard but it's for the best.

People ask for help when they need it or when they want it , However some people may not agree with me because they value their self-reliance and trust their instincts, they think that they should keep their personal problems to themselves but eventually those people are going to start having this feeling like they should talk about it to somebody and ask for their guidance because the same thing happened to me i didn't like telling people what was going on with my life later on i started feeling like i needed to talk to somebody about my decisions and i started to ask my family and friends for guidance.

CF288DDE1328,"Most student enjoy summer vacations, but some educators believe that summer break is too long and that students do not retain information easily. Educators argue that there should be a year-around school, where there would be a 3-4 week off in the spring and fall. But as a student, my position is the opposite of what some educators believe. If our summer keeps as all this past years we can do so many things. When our summer vacations arrive is when all students fell free and out of pression of passing the course year. Summer vacations also open different doors in our life, students chooises are vacations and traveling, others prefer to work, gain money and experience for our future. If summer vacations will be shorter not many students could handdle school, beaks in summer, longer winter break and summer would not have the same impact as summer vactions. It can sound exagerate but that wouldn't be much time to us for do our sumer change.

First of all, In my own experience I like when summer is coming because I know that new experience are waiting for me, but also I like summer vacations because all the ""suffer"" of final examns and the S.O.L are over once again, and I think passing your goals during the years always deserves and award, in this case, Summer vacations. What educators don't see about summer is that gives us an opportnity to be more responsable; many students like me decide to start working. Working has made me a more responsable man, has teach me how reality is, and that money is not an easy thing, and the easier way I can make money is study. Summer is one of the greates time for students, many students go to new places, to visit old family menbers and pass time whit them. Summer last year gived me the chance to go back to my countrie, I couln't do it during winter or spring because I have to study, and the time educators think is the best for us would't provide the same amount of aventures.

More over, When winter break is coming we all happy but it feels too short, adding a few days wouldn't make it so different, plus your adding the same amount of days in four seasons, time for us will pass flying. I also think that many of us would fell like school is never going to end, I would be so stress out that my preformence during the school could be decreasing more and more. Last time I looked an article were they showed a chart, out of 100 student 80 said that they prefere summer vacations over having longers breaks during the year. After that they made an experiment, during a year they sow how was the performence in the students who's choices was summer vacation, and it got prooved that they were doing better because they were constanly going to school.

On the other hand, educators are not at all wrong, when I start againg the school year I some times don't remenber thing that I sow the year before. Also having so much vacations makes me miss school, been with my friends and learning new things. Educators may have a diferet opinion than I, and they can be the one's who are correct, they said that summer is too long because of their experience, and maybe they had learn less. Educators are people who know more than students because of their understanding in the power of learnig.

In conclusion, summer vacations is the best, and it never has to change the aumount of days that they give to us, is prefectly the days that we all need to refresh from school and things that happened over the year.

Summer bring us new experience and it teachs us things like reponsability, a very importat human thing that we all has to have. I beliebe that we things shouldn't change, people and cientificts had prooved that the best way of lerning is how we do it.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0

Some people think that setting yourself goals is something that can't help you in life and you have to follow what others do to be able to find success. They feel that people don't have enough potential to do things and by doing that they have to do what others do and not showing who they really are . I believe that choosing your own character is a way on finding who you really are because you can be able to show things that you never thought you were able of doing, you can set goals and try to put your best on accomplish them, and by setting your own character you can be able to help other people to follow the right path to success.

My first reason why is good of showing your own character is that you can show things that you never thought you were able to do. you can be scared of certain things in life or wont be brave enough to try them but you have to be able to get out of your conference zone and try to step for yourself. this can help you in so many things later in life because you can create or be able to experience new things that can be come very interesting in your life.

setting your own character can provide you on setting yourself goals too by believing in yourself and working hard everyday for what you want. it can help you in so many ways because you can see your own potential and see who you really. not being lazy it all and you would be able to have more energy in your system and try to work for something that can help you in the future and being proud of doing.

Last reason why setting your own character is a good thing because you can help a lot of people too by showing them the right path of success. you can be able of leading them to work hard everyday and help them in motivating by not giving up easy on what they want to accomplish. try to provide them certain thing what they can or cant do making them things a little hard but believing in their self and working harder then usual.

As you read, setting your own character is something that can bring you always to success, it motivates you and you can believe more in yourself on what you can do and getting out of your own conference zone. Help other people whose doing things that they are not supposed to and leading them in the right path, and you can accomplish so many things by hard work.",4.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.0
D001F6D3A0D0,"Everybody would like to be succesful in the life, and that's possible, but is not easy you have to try one time and one more time until you have what you want; it doesn't matter how many times you try for it. In my opinion there are a lot of people that if they fail one time they give up and shouldn't be like that because you will be happy if you complete your goal, you will be a good example to help others to be successful, you can earn more than you expected.

Complete your goal can be really important for you, and will make you happy, for example, my Mom wanted to have a beauty salon, but she knew that it wouldn't be easy; she started with a small room and a few customers, sometimes she didn't have custumers, and that made her think to close the beaty salon, but she never gave up, now she has a big room with a lot of customers; she is happy because she is doing what she likes, and the most important part she never give up. That' is why we have to try many times until we are happy for what we have or what we are doing.

Some people would like to have an example to make their goals, and you can be a good example if you don,t give up at firts time that you fail, for example, I have a cousin, Generic_Name, she was a bad student; she didn't care about her grades, tests, homeworks, and nothing about the schools. when I moved to live with her, she saw my grades and all that things that I do. She stared to ask me how I can have good grades in the tests and be successful, and I said to her,"" you need to have more enthusiasm for the school"" ,and now she has a really good grades and she is going to graduate this year. If we don't stop even if we fail, we can hel others to be successful.

Some people might say that you lost the time trying something many times, however, you can earn more than you expect if you try as much as you can, for example, I saw a video on facebook; there was a man that was loking for a job to support his family; he went to many places, but nobody gave him a job. One time he was walking on the street, and he saw a man trying to fix his car, and without thinking he went to help the other man after that the man was thankful for the help, and he offered a job for the man. The man who was without job; he didn't know that he will get a job on that situation, what would happend if the man would be sleeping in his house; he would never get that job. That is why we never have to lose the enthusiasm to be successful; we never know what is prepared for us.

It is clear that you will feel good if you complete your goals, and you will be a good example of persistence to help others to be successful, you will earn more than you expect if don't give up at the first time that you fail, and maybe is not easy, but you have your whole life to make it happen, and nobody will tell you when to stop; it doesn't matter how many times you try or you fail. The most important part is that you will be successful if you are constant and and what you are doing. ",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,2.5

First, you have to make respect your self, because if you don't do that change, people never is going to respect you and that is something you have to achieve. Second, making the best effort is very good in the today society probability not every one cares about how much you work some people just doesn't see that way. Third, another way that you can make your self respect is acting with a good behavior that's what people see on a person.

To be self-confident. In order to learn students needs to put more attention in class and on what they're doing. First, learning doesn't have anything to do with self-confident, because learn and self-confident are two different things. Second, if you trying to make your self respect you have to start respecting others first, and if you respect then they are going to respect you. Third, I believe that true self-esteem come from achievement, because you earned not is just there for you that is something you have to earn.

In conclusion, self-esteem is not something easy to have you have to work harder to earned that privilege, I don't think school's have something to do with self-esteem or self-confident, but that's something you have to work to get it. ",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0

People who value self-reliance define it as they need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. Should people make their own decisions or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters?

People shouldnt make their own decisions,because they might do something and the need someone thats cam help then or else their going keep doing bad decisions and if they make bad decisions they can get in trouble,problems and etc.

Some pf the people think that they make the best decision but they might be wrong because they always choose the right one or the wrong one it depends on how good are you making choices not always their going to chooser the right one.

Just like how it happen to someone his told him that he could help him go to college but the kid didnt want to go to college as far I can see now he regret not going to college why? Because he made a bad decision his dad could help him but there was a problem he didnt want to go to college. Now he have to work 8 or 10 hours peer day and when he juts could go to college study a carrier that he likes but now his suffering why? Because he didnt make a good decisions. He should be working as a lawyer or Doctor.

D0A5FF29C338,"First impression counts the most and it's impossible to change. A person point of view on someone can never changed because of the many thoughts that go throught the mind, after getting to know that person because no one would want a friend like that. Having a serious face, not taking care of yourself and dressing wrong can lead to having a bad impressions, thats when people think of you in a different way and get things wrong that are not true,but due to the bad first imprsssions it change everything.

Having a serious face all the time can mean lots of things, say for example you're life is horrible, your ready to go fight someone or it can mean I hate everything around me, thats not what makes a good first impression and it makes it impossible to change that. People now days don't want to be friends with someone who is always mad and is ready to fight someone, and because of that particular time you had serious face it led to you not having a girlfriend or a friend that was going to be with you for the rest of your life. First impressions can be hard to change and its impossible because once you had that one chance you waste it all due to that one serious face that everyone was intimidated and now people don't want to talk to you because all it would've took was a smile.

Then,not taking care of yourself can make people not wanting to talk to you. Hygine can can change everything and lets people know about who you are and it makes people wanting to talk to you. Having a bad odor can lead to people running away,can make you look like you just don't care about your'self why would you care about others. Hygine is really important if you want to impress because otherwise it would make a bad impressions leading you not having friends or a girlfriend because no one wants to be around a person who smell bad and doesn't take care of themselves. The smilling comes in quick too, because you have a friendly convertion with people around you and people wnat to be your friends and it may not be because you don't smile. Your breath also counts becasue people like to have a conversation without having to smell what you ate for dinner or what you had for lunch, so is important to saty up with all those things beause people take notice of all those small things and the see that is woth talking to you.

Therefore having the proper clothes for the proper time can change the way people look at you and it can make you have friends and be known for dressing good and people now days want friends who dress up good, for example is the homocoming dance and you go with your friends and you're wearing jeans and shirt and you have your friend all dress up for the occasion and theres you now no one wants to take a picture with you or dance with, dressing the proper way can make a difference on how people see you and is somehting that is a proven fact. When my satrted working as a chef people in the streets would see that her clothes would be all dirty with food stains it would make people think that they don't know how to cook and what is funny that she was making lots of money making food for important people and people was thinking of a different way when she was making more money than the people judging her, but when she started working as a nurse people would respect her for the way she was dress, eventhought she was not making the same amout of money, but people people saw her differently. Those all cahnges that you make in your clothes can make a difference and they don't have to be expensive of from a popular brand because all it is clothes is just how you use them and what makes it good that the clothes can be cheap but how you use them for the proper ocassion can make a difference.

In conclusion having a serious face,not taking care of yourself and the way you dress up can make people have diffent thoughts of you. When being approche or even if they don't talk to you they will see that your not worth talking to and after they know who you are and your way of life style can make people hard to change that first impression of you. All this small things can chenge your life because I have been through those situatioins where people look at you differently and it makes it hard to change someones thought of you and that first impression that is important.

There are a lot of importants reason why it is important to have a positive attitude.

A positive attitude is the key to succes in life because you will have a good relationship with people. People like to be around a person that has a good attitude and is optimistic because they know that you are always going to try to help others and you are going to keep a good attitude during adversities, also if you have a good attitude people will know that they can count on you. You can give people good advices as well as a constructive opinions. Conversly if you have a negative attitude you are going to transmit a bad energy, and people will stay away from you.

Negative people always focus on the bad side of things that's why it is very hard for them to handle problems. Thereby is important to keep a positive attitude, no only because it will help you, but also because you will be more happy.

Another reason why is important to have a positive attitude and why I think is the key to succes in life is because I have seem that people who have a positive attitude are more happy than people that have a negative attitude because they stress for little things that happen , positive people are always trying to see the good side of things, they know everything that happen, happen for a reason and that everything has solution, we just need to look for a way to solve it. People with positive attitude always make better choices than someone negative. For example; The majority of the people with negative attitude give up when they don't reach what they want instead of strive their goal. Largely people with positive attitude always keep going and fighting for their goals until they reach it.

In conclusion a positive attitude is very important to be successful because, it will help you to make a strong relationship with people. Also it is important because you will always find a way to solve conflicts, if you keep a good attitude you also are going to make good chices. You are going to be happier and live peaceful because you are not going to stress about everything .

It is very dangerous at night, and anybody that is out after midnight increases their chances of doing wrong or becoming a victim.

Teenagers are still learning how to fit into this puzzle of life, and without a curfew to guide them bad things are bound to happen. Teenagers do not understand when their parents tell them no, and think a curfew is not needed because they are invincible and bad things never happen to them.

Teenagers need to learn that being more responsible, mature, and becoming a contributing member of society starts with having limits. Curfews will benefit not only teenagers, but society as a whole.

Teenagers think being responsible is not a good thing, because they never want to be told what to do.

If you want graduate from high school you have to be responsible.

Going out after midnight is not being responsible. I have already loss friends to violence, and it occurred late at night.

I have friends that have jobs, and they work after midnight even on school nights. They have trouble staying awake in class, and their grades are not good.

A curfew would also address this situation and help them succeed in school.

Being mature at sixteen is hard for some, but it needs to happen.

Parents need to show their children part of maturing is doing the right thing.

Being mature is understanding that you do not need to be outside late at night.

Maturity helps us understand that in life we can not always do whatever we want. I have friend that complain about not being able to stay out late, but as they mature they will understand that a curfew really helped keep them safe.

Going outside after midnight is very dangerous.

Teenagers must understand that with everything that has gone on the past decade with gun violence, drugs, and robberies; most of it occurred late at night.

There is a reason that most places are closed late night, and there is really nothing to do late at night.

Teenagers need to value their safety, and know that whatever they can not do before midnight does not need to done.

Curfews can help with this mindset and keep teenagers safe.

To reiterate, society as it is now needs to support teenage safety, and a curfew is crucial part in making this happen. Parents should support being more strict with their children's curfew. Midnight is more than enough time for teenagers to experience life.

There is really nothing good for teenagers out past midnight.

Teenage life is one of the most difficult times in our lives as we still are trying to constantly learn. Teenagers do not understand when they are told why they can not do something or how to deal with rejection.

Prime Minister Winston Churchill said ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" I agree with Churchill""s statement because you have to work hard towards success and In general not everything turns out to our favor the first time so, you have to try again until you reach success.

On the other hand success does not consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Success is gain through those who choose to succeed and you do not need to fail in order to succeed.

Working hard towards success without losing enthusiasm is important because you have to be patient and sometimes we can be inpatient so, we loss our enthusiasm we will loss interest and will no longer be motivated to succeed. Enthusiasm is strong warmth of feeling interest. Failing is alright because to succeed you are going to fail and you learn from your lesson, try again, and move on.

On the contrary side success is obtained to those who seek it. Studies show that 78.2% of people don't succeed because they chose to be comfortable and not motivate themselves. Success does not consist of failing and failing ,People should be assertive that they want to succeed so they are prepared with the mindset not to fail.

D2DF0FA5218C,"Has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people's lives?

I believe that it is a negative way for people to have too much technology, one reason is because, people get to be more lazy, another reason is that people don't put much effort on what they are doing, and the last reason is that people get to be shy or nervous whenever they go out. People get to be more lazy on the way that technology can bring them everything to their doors: clothes, food, kitchen stuff, etc. They can do everything by only moving one finger, they don't have to make any eye contact with others. If people are always using technology they are not going to put much effort on what they are doing: paper works, homework, projects etc. They just can copy and paste stuff,

it is better what they have in their minds, talk with someone else about it, socialize with others so they can have more ideas, one person can explain it to each other so they get to understand it better, be proud of what they did and not what technology did for them, see their skills. Sometimes people get to be shy or nervous when they go out because they are use to order things by technology, they are just on their cell phones and not socializing with human contact, most of the stores have machines so they can get to pay without looking or talking with another person, that way people get to be more insecure of themselves when they have to socialize: job interviews, going to college, making a group when they're at school etc. With technology, people get to be more dumb in the way that technology does everything for them. It is better to get up and explore the world, give some effort on what they are doing, and meet new people. Some people while they are walking down the street, and they see another person coming they just look at their cell phones so they don't make any eye contact with other people. It is really sad what's happening with our society. While some people believe that technology is a positive way to grow as society however, I think It is making the people to not explore the world or socialize with others.

you can stay comfortable but it won't help because your just wasting time and effort that you could become a better human being and spread your knowledge with other people. You should always try to strive to become the best you can be.

I say people should agree on this because not trying to fix your or improve yourself is not the best way to go. Like they shouldn't disagree i say because it not a bad or good thing but it would be amazing to push yourself and be more educated get pain a lot for having that big of a knowledge and use it think help people that can't help themselves. us humans should help everyone we can even if it's little people sometimes don't ask for help but if they dont ask you tell them you need help.

Some people also may disagree because they might think only about themselves or they think that there at a good point that they dont have to try anymore or try there very best they think thieve mastered the problems and situations. They think that they can't learn anything else but there wrong we human beings can always learn something more strive to be better humans, father,mothers,sons,daughters etc... but the point is don't settle for okay do more.

We Should learn not to stay cozy you should try to improve a bit everyday or learn something new help yourself and help each other out if they need help or if you need it learning and talking to other people wont hurt you so like

Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow""

is a true fact and you should try to be a better human or person in life and become someone that people can look up too.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5
D2FB14A7C43B,"Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" However, it is a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people. People may follow every step you do, because they want to success in life by being influences by others. It is the main thing to show people that they can do what they think they are not able to do.

First reason is, People may follow every step you do, because they want to success in life by being influence by others. For example, my friend

Generic_Name has a son, who according to her he wants to be a lawyer. Generic_Name husband who's name is Generic_Name is a lawyer. Although their son Generic_Name is taking only math classes in collage, which it has nothing to do with laws. Generic_Name and Generic_Name want to influence Generic_Name to become a lawyer. But Generic_Name is being influence by his Algebra class teacher. Generic_Name has a very high score on math, and his Algebra teacher believe that Generic_Name can be a math teacher in a college. Generic_Name teacher knows how hard he works to do everything right and how his behavior it is showed.

Another reason is, It is the main thing to show people that they can do what they think they are not able to do. For example, when my brother was nine years old he wanted to be a Pilot, but he was just really scared of heights. When my brother graduated from high school he wanted to go to Army. Somehow my mom find out that he really did not wanted to do that what he really wanted to do was being a Pilot. My mom is a Flight Attend and she told my brother that some people will say you are too weak to do this and that, but they actually does not know what you are capable to do. With those words my mom influence my brother, and now he is a Pilot and he works for the Air Force. My mom gave him an example that no one believed on her the only person who believed on her was her mom. As my mom says, "" Don't let other people think you are not able to do things, which they we're not able to do.""

Some people may think that there are better ways to influence others. However, it can be true, but people get more influence by examples. There are not many ways for example, if someone who is very important who wants to influence someone else who is not that important to be come important as they are. Does not mean this person is going to have the same luck to become really important. Do not let other people influence you by other ways, let them give you an example of how you are going to success.

In conclusion, It is a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people. To teach them what it is good and what it is wrong to do. Given your own examples and teach them how to behave. Dot let people think that example is not the main thing to influence others.",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5
D30D6D7F3D39,"Some teachers think about the benefits of working with a group or working alone. I feel that working together would be more helpful for all students because they can share more ideas, have less work and can be working with less stress.

Students can have a little conversation for get more information, then they can pick one or more ideas for make their work more easy . They can argue from each idea that could be more important. Every students have different thoughts that can help them to realize a good work. For example, When I was in my country my teacher said that we can choose work together or alone, and I prefer to work alone because I thought that working alone was more beneficial for me but I was really confused about it. Working together help us to know different option and students can have more social communication.

Working together imply to have less work. Students can be take more opportunities for learn new thing everyday, also that can help teachers too. Less work can be helpful for a lot students because they can realize missing work, extra work and other activities during class. Furthermore, I remember when I was in 6 grade my teacher said that ''less work can help you to have more time for you'' that means that sometimes with less work teachers and students could learn and have more progress.

Some classes can be stressful for a many students because teachers need to realize all activities during their classes and sometime students do not understand what they need to do. Otherwise, working together would be more easy for students to finish their work quickly. One important fact in my life that

I never forgot is when my English teacher said that we have just 10 minutes for take the exam, and everyone fail because he was very strict with us. Working with another person have a lot benefits for reduce stress. Students can help each other and check their own work .

In conclusion, Working together could be very helpful for many students who need help for get better grades during the year. All students prefer to work with people who has different option, ideas and new thing that help them. They can have more time for make missing work or do homework during class. Working together would be more beneficial for all students.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.5

societies decide student at the young age are expected to decide what collage or univercity they want and what carrer they should be going to chose. students in freshman year cannot decide what they want to study or what collage they want to go ,because their too young to make that important decition even if they make it , when the years passed they are going to study another carrer, anoher one that gives then inspiration

.student should not commit in a carrer with young age,they can make a bad decition, if they have another oportunity to change their decition it can be good but if they can't it can be bad if you get in a carrer that your are not going to improve.

students who enter to HS for the first time they should focus on get classes for example: art, economy, guitar, etc. Another responsability that the student shoud focus is in get credits for dipoma that they want that can be standard or advanced diploma another think they must focus is get good grade for all four years nine, ten, eleven, and the most important 12 but when the student get into the eleven grade they must being thinking about what they want to study, searching for collage and carrers, get imformation about collage and universities that can be good for you. when they get a good noulesh ,they can ask than self, its that what they want to study and don't led anyone make a decition for you,think about a carrer that can like you and benefit you in the future something that like you and never is going to get tired of your carrer because you like what you chose for your and you have a pasion on your carrer that why society have to change that expectation that the students have to make a desiton in young age,choosing a carrer is not a game its imortant to contrivuted with the society in life if you choos a carrer that you are not going to improve is going to be dificult cause yo have make a wrong decition

Teachers in higt school shuld provide a good ideas for student talks about, how the collage or the univercity it can be teach them how is the way the collage and univercities work with the students. However, when the students are youngest they cannot decide what they want to study, firts they want be a doctor and the a few years later a police and thats how it goes youngest student can't decide what they want to be until they get to a good age and a good inspiration on a class and that helps them to decide what carrer they want,student should focus on the carrer they want baced in what class are they very good when you are in eleven garde you see that your are good in something, you don't have to chose a carrer that you don't understand or you don't like. schools shuold focus on what the student want to be in the future but they can focus to in what are they good for example: they can see if the student if good painting it can be a painter or if the are good in number it can be good in bussines such as banks , cashier and they can improve all this nuolage in the job that the students has as a part-time ,thats what the schools should focus in what the students are good and then make a decition of what can study and what it can be a good collage or univercity for each one .

societies should not expect that students with young age should decide to chose what to study (a carrer) they don't have clare ideas to decide what they want to syudy. However, many student that make a decition in young age they can decide but in a few month they are going to chose another carrer because they don't like what they decide or they don't have the noulage, that why youngets students cannot make a important decition until they get in a good noulage.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0
D4490C9F73B9,"It has been said first impressions are almost impossible to change, but I'm not agree with it because people always change and the first impression doesn't define who you are.

The people always change to good or bad. For example, I met someone that in the first time I saw him he was mad, he never smiled, and he was very shy. And at the pass of the days he was changing, he started to smile, and he wasn't mad like the first time I saw him. Now my impression changes and now I can see that he's different and the first impression I had about him changed at all. Another example could be that in the first days of classes your teacher is nice, doesn't give you homeworks, and he is patient with the students. However, He is changing every day. Now he's always mad, now he gives you a lot of homework, and he's yelling in class. At this time, the first impression you had about the teacher totally changed because he's not the nice teacher that you met in the first days of classes.

The first impression doesn't define who you are because first impression is like a front of a book and the front of the book is nothing comparable to the that is inside of the book. For example, I have some friends that told me that the first time they saw me they didn't like me because they says that I'm always mad and I was a boy that don't talk with anybody just with my friends and they told me that they never thinked that I'll be their friend, but they were knowing me and they saw that I was different from their perspective and from the first time I met them, so they changed their first impression about me and their point of view about my personality. Another example, is that some people thinks that you're like they think just because they have a bad first impression about you. I mean sometimes we don't have good days and we are not like always. Let's go to suppose that in those days you met a person and you're having a bad day, you're mad, and with problems, so that person will think you're like that because that person will have a bad impression about you, but if that person have the time to know you better, he will see that you're not like he thinks you are just because the first impression about you is bad. If he is knowing you better, he will change his impression about you compare to the first time.

Clearly, the first impression always is going to change because one impression doesn't define my personality and how I am and I can change that impression. It have to be like more than two impressions to know a person because it will be hard to changes those impresions.",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
D457F3AEAC6D,"I do agree with Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchhill without failure how can we humans excied in life to get to success? To prove my statement i will provide two reasons, and also two examples, explaining why i believe that failure can lead humans to a world we couldnt imagine it could exiest.

Reason number one would be Battles and Wars. I believe that losing Battles and Wars help us the united states of america create new weapons wither it was nuclear or bullets. Another reason why i say that is because without losing those battles and wars how wouldve we found out about atomic bombs or harden steel bullets. It sounds crazy and highly dishorroable to are fallen heros who were killed in action, but if we won wars and battles everytime we would soon fall. Because we keep using the same positions and plans in order to win, and we also would feel too confident in wining so we will be using the same weapons over and over again and let the other team discover those new atomic weapons.

Reason number two is about automobles. Automobles have been around for a very long time now i guess if my calculations are right its been almost 1,500 years since Henrey Ford showed the world his first ever automoble, the Model T. Henrey Ford had to go through so many people doubting his Model T project would work. Day by day, month by month, even year after years of failed experments. But in the spring of 1830 he successfully got one fully working and running. He had to go through so much walls blocking his path in order to show the world that a automoble was and still is possible. Another example would be Tesla. The famous electronic car company to power there cars with electricity. those guys mustve gone through so many experments that i cant even imagine and the amout of failed ones too and im pretty sure there is alot more failed test projects than passed ones. I say that to be reasonable about it not saying it to make fun of them because if they didnt fail the first time the first modles would have been super crappy, like the cars would suck. Because after every failed project you get new ideas and new imagines of how you want the car to repersent the company and have a good repuation. So if failure wasnt an option for these two companys the cars of 2020 wouldve sucked so much because the company will only car about the money and just send running crappy looking cars that we humans have as a need for work and family.

Those are my last two thoughts about failure and Wisten Churchill isn't wrong at all. Without failure succces would feel like nothing like if it was pointless. And we wouldnt live the world we live in today if it wasnt for people back then who didnt stop failing until they reached succesed.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5

honesty can bring you to a better life and future. because so you can have a lot of friend that can trues you, and you can have good grades at school, and might go to college. also when a person come up to you and tell you stuff you have to be honest and tell them no please leave me alone. honest is good in life because no one would like you if you lie with other about stuff you have to be honest to your self sometimes not always. lieing will get you in trouble at school, home, or other places so that why you have to not lie and tell the true. because so people will be happy not mad at you and people like a person not to lie because a lot of people say that lieing is a bad habit for anyone in the world.

when you be honest to your family they would say this kid tell the true all the time he is a good son i every have. and they might give you something like a price for not lieing and your mom or dad they teach you to be kind with others. so when you grow up as an adult you remember what your parents tough you in the past. like be honest, dont lie, always act good to others have respect to teachers or other family member. your family want you to be a better person in the future that why you should tell your parent thank you for telling me to be an a some person in life.

finally when you be honest to teacher they would say you are a good student in the class because you have been kind with student, and you have been telling the true when someone is doing a bad choice. when you be honest in school the teachers will tell your parents that you are doing good in school. school want us to learn make right choices and always be honest around you dont follow want people are do if they are doing something bad in school dont fallow and tell on an adult that they are doing something bad.

honesty is a something you tell that true like it bring you to a better life that you can have a lot of friend that trust you so they dont think you are bad person for a example in school when you be honest the teacher will say you are a good student to have in class. when you are at home if you be honest to you parents they mint be happy and give you a price for being a honest person. honest is a good in life so people will respect you in any way it is important in life.

Also if you have a positive attitude you can accomplish your goals. Therefore if you have a positive mindset not only can you achieve and accomplish your goals. You can be proud of who you have become and your hard work. Once youv'e done everything you dreamt of achieving. Your parents would be so proud.

But seeking guidance is that bad either for someone to make their own decisions says to someone else that they know what they are doing and can build something great with how their working and planning for the future.

Although seeking guidance is the worst thing to do, i feel like people making decisions for themselves is better.

For example if i were to go to someone for guidance or for something more and they give me some sort of guidance or idea and it turn out bad for me. Than i would never be able to go another person for guidance and ideas and i would most likely turn to myself. Then theres the problem that the reason that i went to seek guidance was because i couldn't make a decision for myself and now since I'm self reliant it will be hard for me to make my own decisions.

Now if i didn't go to the authorities and experts and made the decision for myself but it still ended up being bad outcome. It still would have been a lot better for me so that i can use the experience of making my own decision to help make better one in the future.

Now if you go to the authorities and experts to seek guidance and it it come out great and now your life is going great. Until the time to make your own decision it will be even harder to make then the time you went for guidance. That you yourself will fell behind and lose whatever chance that you had because you never made a decisions for yourself and thats problem some people have because they have been going to someone else to make your life decisions.

In conclusion to go somewhere to seek guidance isn't bad it's what comes out of it to help you if it turns out bad or good it will effect your decision making to be better and worst.

I believe that when someone work hard or try their best on what they're instersted about they could accomplish their goals.

When setting up goals, we want to accomplish them in the furture. By accomplish our goals we have to keep working harder and focus closely until we could reach our goals. Get ideas how you could accomplish your goals; for a example , by particupating schools programs ,or other smalls groups that could help you reach your goals. Keep praticing on what you're instersted about because we accomplish more by always doing something repeatly. Always be positive on reaching your goals and always try something new beacuase you won't know if you good at something else that you never knew before or try before.

Most of time we don't accomplish anything its because we not trying or we don't really care about finishing or completing anything. Sometimes always doing something repeating doesn't help for some people, since it may not work out for them.

D7528DEBA951,"Isnt technology just great? through time technology has been advancing, and it's just getting better, but is it minimizing our connections with the human contact? I believe its had a good positive effect on peoples lives. see it this way, technology helps us so much like buildings cars and airplanes, technology has taken over restaurants in such a way that you no longer have to tip! technology and stores do mix and its just speeding up the process.

Although technology might be taking hundreds of jobs, technology is one of the best things we have in this world. Ford industry is a great example they make their cars using robotic technology! by using these big instruments they are able to make a car every ten minutes, that's incredible, and not just that they have the capacity to sell trucks without specking to a customer, representative its all online no need of customer service. Having to buy parts has never been easier thanks to Ford/store. org get the piece you need the next day. Near my local ford dealer they have a great restaurant where technology is all they utilize.

Who would've known by using technology in restaurants everything would run much smoother, by using technology ordering your favorite meal off a tablet was never this cool. Yes that means there would only be a few people employed and less contact with waiters/staff members but there is a good side, no need to worry about tip, especially no human mistakes, order everything off your finger tips. while your enjoying your meal staff members will have a chance to be doing somethings else unless called by a customer. Have you seen how long it takes to check out in Walmart! thanks to technology now and days?

Have you ever experienced or seen a cashier take a billion years just to scan the chicken your considering purchasing? i have and It was devastating to watch! or have you witnessed a wrong change? things like this happen way to often and if you never noticed it on your receipt you just lost some money. That's why they invented self checkouts to speed up the process of purchasing, thanks to these great machines leaving Walmart was never easier to do. Just scan and go! sooner or later every store in America will have these great machines. Yes they'll once in a while have some bad performance but most of the time there really reliable. Is it weird not seeing a employee in the cash register? yes but you'll get use to it as time continues.

Having technology in our side has made us better and has lighten our sense of being, technology has been so good to us that it has brought positivists in our lives. How stressful would it be for Ford Junior to hire millions of workers, and finish one car every five hours? or opening up a restaurant and hire twenty workers who are rude, lazy to there customers? and last but certainly not least, Walmart having hundreds of workers who take forever to scan and pack your items.

D752DF2541DD,"Dear Principle,

changing the policy is a good idea, because many people have c average, and if they play any sports, they might get a lower average than a c. Also they have to focus on their school work first than the sports, and like I said before playing sports might get them failing. Also, if nobody is making a change, on their grades than maybe she could change it but, meanwhile she should keep it to a b average to play any sports or to be in any activity, the students are going to try their best at making good grades to play sports. It is good in many reasons to keep a good average, because then they get their report card or their progress reports and they see that they have a low average, it is going to be because they are focusing to much in their sports or activities. The principle should first see how the students react to the changing, and if it works than, yea keep it, but she can always change it. It doesn't matter if they have a high C, but then need to have a B. Most students would argue about having to study, but i think its for their own good, also the school will change, for example, the school recognized for having a C average ad letting them play sports or do any activities, that could change if the students try hard enough and change the C to a B, then the school will recognized by having a B average on, most of the students.

The reason that its best for students to have good grades, its because also at the end of the year if they don't have a good average, they will not be able to pass the year. Back to the point it will be challenging, but I'm sure the students that love playing sports or being part of school activities, those people will actually try and make those grades, but if for some reason, those people who tried their best, like they went to tutoring, did all their home and school work, and turned it in, then you might want to check in with his/her teachers and see if they want to let them participate, but everyone can make at least a B, not an A but a B, because we all are very smart, some smart as others, but yes I'm sure, it will all work out, but if they keep on complaining, and they don't actually try to do their best, and they slack off, go to sleep in class they you won't see a difference n their grades, then that's their lost, because we want our school to be recognized, with all of out players with a B. one of the reasons why i want the students to have a good average, its because, those who want to succeed will try until they get it right, but if you are the person who doesn't care, then whose fault is that?

So i would like to have that policy. As i told you before, everyone is smart enough to pass their grades, even if, they don't think so.

It wont be so bad, either, to try your best at school, even if you just do it for sports, but i you were the type of person that was failing, then now you can say that you are passing all of your classes, don't think of what other people have to say, just do it for yourself.",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

DA5CA667B729,"My dad once said"" that one day I'll save a life just by calling 911"". The reason he said that is that the technology today is better than the one he grew up with. Technology today can do more things than the technology a few years ago. Technology today does have a positive effect on people because it can help people communicate with people around the world, and people can call 911 for an emergency.

It helps people communicate with people around the world. For example my Uncle can't leave the country to go visit his mom but if he does he can't return to the states. So the technology now allows him to Skype or Facetime his mom when he wants. In fact 70%

of the people around the world can communicate. All the people can now connect with anyone with just a simple button.

People can call 911 for an emergency. For example my dad had witness a car crash when he was driving to work. When he saw the car flipped over he quickly got his phone and called 911. The cops came in like 3 minutes. When the cops arrived they quickly got the guy out of his car where he was flipped. So thankfully my dad was there to call 911 for him and saved his life. In fact 55% of people that call 911 save a life. So if you ever witness an accident call 911 because you might save a life.

Technology does have a positive effect on people. It can help people talk to people all over the world. People can also call 911 for emergency. Other people believe that technology is the root of evil, however technology helps everybody no matter what. So technology is the best thing humans ever created because it can help anybody do anything.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,5.0,4.5
DA86BC9B9FB6,"I think is a good choice for people to take classes online or at home because they can learn more and concentrate better and put more attention and nobody can distract them. I think if people do it online or at home they are not going to make friends. Sometimes is good to make friends because they can help you or be with you in someway is good to go school then taking at home or online. Also if they do it online or at home they are going to be more prepared and ready for wet ever situation because they was putting attention in their lessons. But being in a group in school is more interesting because you can meet new people and don't be alone doing the work but everything have their good choices for do it and people can decide how they want to do it or how much they want lo learn.

some people prefer to take classes from home or online. because they can be more concentrate without nobody distracting them. I think it will be a good choice for them to do it online. For example if they are doing work in a group they are talking and don't concentrated but if they are with nobody they can work better and do their work. This can be the reason for more people take that classes because they work better with out no one else. The people who studies online or at home are more intelligent, and learn more because they are concentrate in what they are doing. In sometimes in the schools they are not concentrate because they are playing or talking with their friends and that can distract people. If they make a competition an student who studied on line or at home with one student is a regular school I think the student is not on the school can win because sometimes that students are more prepared then the regular school. Also sometime the students who go to a regular school they just go for play with their friends is good to have some friends but they are not concentrate o they are sleeping when the teacher is explaining and then when they do the exam or quiz they fail. But if one student is studding online or at home they are listening for when they have to take the exams they can pass and are more responsible with that.

When the school is over at the end of the year some people learn a lot but some people no because they were just playing and don't putting attention or sleeping in class. But the people who studies online or at home they are ready know a lot because they were concentrated and no one was distracting them and that if how they work someones want to learn and pass and someones no each one can take their own decision. I think studies online is more better, more productive at the and of the year. Taking classes at home can benefit at the students in many ways and they know more at the end of the school. When the students at the regular school at the end of the year they have an SOL test. some students fail this test because they did not learn nothing for the rest of the year just for be sitting and doing nothing. But if someone who studies at home have the ability to pass the SOL because they were interested of the class of what were they learning and don't have distractions all year.

DAD01CB5C8D8,"I'm not against having the after school homework club. I'm not against it because some people are failing their classes especially me and i would want to go to an after school homework club because one it would be helpful, two sometimes I forget that I have homework, and three sometimes I just want to get it over with and be done with the homework.

One of my reasons that I'm not against the after school club is because the students can get there grades up and have more practice when you take any test that you don't know about. For my opinion I would like to have this club because some teachers go really fast when there teaching and I can't catch up to them and it's really difficult for me. Some of the students don't know what the teacher is teaching about because maybe the subject there learning is there weakest strength to learn about.

My second reason is that students need this class because they want to achieve in life. Maybe someone wants to go to college to learn about photography but the school they want to go to is too expensive to afford like for example they want to go to a well good college but it's to expensive but the person who wants to be a photographer needs to apply for a scholarship that means they need to have good grades, participate in after school activity and much more this is why students like me need to have a after school homework club.

My third reason is that some students don't do there homework because they forgot it at school or they don't remember they have homework. People like me don't like doing homework because it's really difficult and sometimes I need help doing my homework and it would help me have in my school a after school homework club because that would be helpful to me and other students.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

DBC04530D2F9,"Have your ever ask yourself what makes a person's character?. Some People think that a person's character is define by their actions and by what their selves choose to. While others think that character is form by influences beyond control. I agree that as individuals our character is influenced beyond our control because of , internet influence, fit in society , and by actions.

One reason why character is influence beyond control is because people get influenced by internet platforms. Internet platforms in influence in many ways some could be good , while other not quit so. Character is influence by social medias posts , YouTube videos and variables of things. These kind of things interfere with a person characteristic people might want to follow and do what they see on internet. a person might not even be awarded that they are being influence by internet.

second claim why a person's character is influence beyond control is because they get influence by society. People might feel that to fin in society they have to have the same characteristics and act the same as others to be accepted and tolerated by society. People who is pressure by others would act and do things that they know are no specifically good. For example you are a very respectful and kind person but they you turn into a not so kind person their has to be something making you changed the way you are and that could be other people , changing your character.

Lastly people's characteristics are influence beyond control because of the actions they take in life.

People's actions influenced the way they are and act. By taking good actions your character will be defined in a positive and understandable way. good actions will be the key into having authentic and unique character.

In conclusion there are many factors that influence that a person's character.

People some often get their way of acting and doing thinks from internet platforms which could be something bad it's not take with careful. Today,s society can have a big impact in everyone's lives, we are living in a time were people would do whatever takes to fit in and feel like think they are part of society, but sometimes being around people is not mentally healthy.

I play different sports during some seasons, for example when soccer season has ended. Another sport I'm kinda good at is basketball. I play sports in school and outside of school. A few other things I can do is sing and dance.

I'm going to start with soccer. So I started playing soccer in 2018. I dont really remember my age but I do remember the year. When I started playing soccer was when I lived in Generic_City. I played there for to seasons. I played in the spring and fall seasons. When I played in the spring it was the best thing ever like I'm telling you I literally fell in love with soccer at that time. My team was a good team we were called the sharks. I was number 14 and I was happy because that's the number that both of my cousins jersey numbers are. Anyways, we won a few games and lost a few ones but we always played good, we gave our best, and we gave it all. After, spring season ended I played on the fall season. I'm going to say that fall season was okay it wasn't as good as spring season but I still enjoyed it. My jersey number changed in that season so then I was number 16. I haven't played since 2019 ended but I will start playing again pretty soon and I'm really happy and excited.

Now I'm going to talk about my basketball season. Last year in 7th grade I was in Generic_School and they put up the girls basketball season was coming. I was interested in it so I decided to sign up and try-out for the team. I can't lie try-outs were rough but at the end of the day I gave my best and it was fun. A few weeks later they put up the paper of the people who made it and I saw my name and I was so happy. Anyways, that season ended, then school ended, and I moved to Generic_City. School started a few months later girls basketball season started. I was happy so I sign up. I went to try-outs for the whole week. At the end of Friday which was the last day of try-outs the coach Generic_Name told the girls who made the team and who didn't and guess who made the team MEE!!!!. I was so happy my friends and I celebrated on the way out. The whole season was great, I made so many fun memories with the girls and I was just so happy.

My third skill is dancing. I love to dance everyday. Like I'm always dancing in the car, shower, kitchen, my room, just everywhere. I love it and I enjoy it very much. It's something that could never leave me. Im going to start taking dancing classes so I'm very excited for that. One app that I always use to dance is Dubsmash it has different song that I can dance to. I'm always dancing to a song in the car when a song comes up and it has beats I just be going crazy.

Finally, the last thing I love to do is sing. Singing for me is just very enjoyable and calming. I sometimes get on my feelings and cry but it's just because they are really good songs and I cry because I'm happy or sad. I love to sing the songs of Sydney R. But my top favorite songs to sing are All of Me, Into you, Love don't Change, and How you gonna. And yeah these are all the stuff that I do as a skill or talent. ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5

I agree that the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families because of students needing more time on homework and studying, students wanting more time on other hobby's, and students would like to choose the right activities for them.

Students would like to have there own time to finish homework and studying. Some students would like to be involved in extracurricular activities which makes some of them having a hard time in school or having good grades, because they don't have the time for studying and completing homework, and also it makes them stressful because they might be having hard time to understand the teacher in the classroom.

DD265EC28AEB,"Now a days schools are finding new ways to use cell phones for educational purposes. Schools and teachers want to find new ways to educate students through cell phones since every child is attracted to them. But with schools trying to find ways that works, it does have its negative effects to it. The effects with using cell phones in classroom for educational purposes is that many students will end up getting off tasks, no more hands on learning, and they will start to relying too much on their cell phones. With cell phones being use for educational purpose, it has its negative effects to it and will affect student's learning in the process.

As cell phones are being use for educational purposes, a negative effect to this idea is that students will not focus or get off task in their classes. If they use cell phones in classroom for a method to educate people, students with tend to get distracted on their phones and not learn what they are suppose to teach. Students will also end up dozing off and start to listen to music or even end up playing games on their phones and not focus on what's being taught. Also with social media being so big now a days students will focus more on texting friends or being on their Snapchat, Instagram, or even Twitter rather than focusing on what teacher is showing the classroom. With cell phones being use in classroom, students will end up getting more distracted and off task than when you do not use cell phones in the classroom to teach. The next paragraph will talk about another reason why using cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes has its negative effect.

As cell phones are being use for educational purposes, a negative effect to this idea is that there is no more hands on learning for students. If school are using cell phones as a method to teach people, the students are not getting the hands on learning that they should get. Back then before everyone had a cell phone the way they were taught was with the step by step on doing the work and trying to understand how you ended up doing the work. But if they use cell phones in the classrooms the students would not be getting the step by step understanding of the work, rather than they doing it on the phones and just getting the answers. With schools using phones in the classroom the students would not be getting the same knowledge and understanding to specific problems and work than those who learn the step by step learning to the problems. In the next paragraph we will see another reason why using cell phones for educational purposes has a negative effect in the classrooms.

As cell phones are being use for educational purposes, a negative effect to this idea is that students will end up relying too much on their cell phones and technology to get the work done. As the more classroom or schools end up using cell phones for educational purposes the students will end up relying on their phone to get the work done for them and not try to do it theresleves. For example imagine students cell phones end up not working and they only used their cell phones to get the work done, what are they going to do now if they only use their phone to do the work and they did not learn the material on their own. With schools using phones as a way of teaching it with effect the students ways of learning and will start to rely on his/her phone in the later future to get their stuff done. In the last paragraph it will concluded the paper and sum up everything about the paper.

In conclusion if more and more schools end up using cell phones for educational purposes they will make more students get distracted during class, not have the hands on learning they should have, and also they will start to rely on their cell phones more for the work rather than them trying to do the work them self. With cell phones trying to be used as a method of learning, it will end up not giving the students the education they need but rather them showing a way to get the work done quicker without all the extra work that should be done. So schools should stick with the methods they have now and not try to add cell phones as another method of teaching these students. ",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5

For some people it could be easy for the others really hard whether it's elementary, middle , high school thats hard getting ti know the school. Say we get a bad grade and they try so hard to get the perfected score. But they studied so hard to get a good grade. So they assist someone.

So the schools created these things to help other students if they are having troubles with there grades, their classes, assist the students get there grades up so they can get better and better. They help each others for reasons to get a good grade. Its good that each schools are doing this to help pther students. They can get a school a chance make new friends get better in school and then they could help other students to get good grades this is a good program for the other students.

When the student grow, their interest of subject changes because they came out in a real world. They observe from their around,what they want to do and what they want to be but in early graduation they have only choices to complete requirement courses in given time which make them specific and confuse in collage.

E0BABC4506D0,"What are some decision that students take regarding extracurricular activoities?

Many students become involved in extracurricular activities to enrich their educational experiences, and some even become involved in so many activities that they have a little time to study or complete homework assignments.

Some activities carry out in the morning, with this the students have time to do his homeworks or study, however who practice in the afternoon can do it during school. A lot of them works after school, so the activities is the best option and they don't deside to take this extracurricular activities. Students who involve in many activities it's complicated to take hours to study, and some times the parents need to leave his sons at the practice, many parents don't have time to do that because they work.

In opinion of the students is that best decision it's take only one activity.

E0E060143B79,"Do you think failure lead you to do better? In this paper i will argue about never losing enthusiasm by falling and falling. Failure should be just another way to do better, because you try until you get it right, when you fail; failure lead you to success in life. Also, enthusiasm and try is the key to success.

First of all, when you try until you get it right, sometimes you get really frustrated. For example; in freshman year i remember that i couldn't actually get good grades in my algebra class, i remember that i try and try my harder to get good grades. I even stayed after school, I was doing my homework, i was watching videos from my teacher. However, i was still getting bad grades in my class but i keep trying and i finally become a success in the class.

Secondly, when you fail; failure lead you to success in life. When you are working on a project or you are working on a personal goal sometimes thing doesn't actually goes the way you had planted. For example; if you are trying to solve a mathematics problem but you never get the solution you're supposed to get. Although, you keep trying and you always fail, you actually learning from it. However, by keep trying your best you actually getting experience from your failure and that helps you to success later in life.

Finally, enthusiasm and trying is the key to success. For example; when you want to achieve something but you fail, each time you're losing enthusiasm because you think that you can not do it, but if you keep trying and trying their will be a time that you will going to success and you would said that you try your best and never lost enthusiasm for your goal.

In conclusion, some people said that failure doesn't lead you to success, but they wrong because the more you fail, the more you try, and when you get it right, it will be a completely success for you. Going failure to failure led you to a good way to do better in life because the harder you try the better you do to success. In the future never stop trying without losing enthusiasm because enthusiasm is the key of your success.",3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5
E110443F5184,"""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""Therefore,in my opinion character traits can be chose but it must show as true self that represent you. Why, let me tell you; every on has their own unique traits even the traits they get from their parent. lastly animal spirit do show has traits that represent as our character traits. Although,I do disagree with character traits with influences us that help improve our trait that can help us set right path.

Everyone has their own unique traits. Some people has traits like kindness,honesty,caring,and more. Unfourtely that some character traits can't be chose but sometime character traits chose you as your character traits .For example my character traits is pretty weird: kind honesty,helpful,caring,little crazy and lastly trickery like the fox. Same with parents has their own unique character traits;however, parents' character traits can be passed down to children base on their character traits and if they are worthy of the carry their parent's traits. For example,It remind me the time when I am all dressed up and got my hair done after that I look at the mirror; I notice that I look familiar at the time I realized that I look like mom. As poof that I do have my mom's gene meaning I have her physical look. As i explain even character trait and be passed down or chose have own character traits.

Next, everyone has their own spirit animal that is represent your character traits. For example if the person has the character trait which is playful,love water,caring,and fun loving as poof of this person character traits show their spirit animal is dolphin. Therefore, anyone can chose their character trait that is best suit for them. It is unique for people and important having spirit animal and character traits to help them balance it out and chose what character trait that best represent him or her. Which allow the person to identify what spirit animal is and identify which character trait the animal is. For insist,White tiger know for protect their pup like any mother would do as the same trait as our mom has show.

Choosing character trait could be tricky for everyone but it is important to be wise which character trait is best for you. You can choose which character traits,sometime it can lead to having great friend or loving family. But their will be a price to pay like if you are kind then someone will take avenge of you in order to trick or frame you. My opinion is to be strong and persist or sass but your pick add them long with your chosen character trait. Character traits can be blessing in disguise and curse.

As you see chosing your own character trait is better then someone influences you; it only cause problem and change you then your real self. Although, I explain my reason:everyone has there own unique trait ,animal,lastly the price of choosing character trait. Therfore I always said ""Character trait can be beautiful but a curse in disguise"". Anyway not a problem. That I truly believe that everyone has the right to chose their own character traits then having someone influences them to have the same character trait as them then having your own traits.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
E12450BAE343,"Would it be surprising to know that kids learning at home helps them not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by student getting to much school work that cannot all be handied in on night. Every day kids complain about having too much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Allowing children to work on their own schedule helps them become more motivated to work. Students being educated at school gaing more freedom to create their own schedule and their own rules. Learning at home and not at schools helps kids succeeed and have better grades.

One of the best thing about homeschooling is that it can be done at anytime, and anywhere. Children have a flexible time schedule which means that the parents can help. The students can work around the parents schedule instead of the parents working around the student's schedule. Some students have a trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pase set by teachers. Homeschooling allows students to work at their own pace and on their own schedule. Another thing about homerschooling is that there are no misguided rules about technology or how to dress. This is good because instead of worrying about the rules. The students can focus on their studies.

When you are taking a test or taking notes at a public school there are many distractions that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. This is another reason that learning from home would benefit students. Learning from home won't have the distractions that a classroom has. As a result of this, students won't lose focus on the work they are doing and get better grades. One of the reasons students get distracted in the first place is because they are in an environment their are not familiar with, which makes the feel uncomfortable. If a students learns from home they will feel more relaxed and confortable and won't stress about work. In a school, you are struck at desk for 6 hours and have a limited time to eat and limited bathroom breaks. This is not help a student's learning at all. On the other hand. If you are at home you can eat and do whatever you want when you want.

There are still a few reasons not to do distanced learning. There are many more opportunities with public schools. People from different colleges don't go to students'homes and try to advertise their career options. Making friends from home would be difficult without social interaction. Public school are great places to socialize during free time. If everyone goes home to attend school funding for public schooling willl fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of buged cuts. In public schools, depending an the teachers, cheating is hard to do.

My conclusion is students should be offered classes online or at home because the environment is less distracting, which could be less stressful. At home there are less distractions, rather than at school where there are many different thing to students, can greatly affect the quality of a student's work.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0
E20DE200FEA8,"There are people who believe that true self-esteem comes from praising the student's work and others believe that true self-esteem comes from achievement. There are situations where a student should feel that his real hard work is considered good by praising his work. There are some students that feel that their work was good, because of their achievements. There are some types of students:

Students that make themselves feel especial when their work is appreciated

Students that feel that their work was hard by achievements

Students that even if they do not try their best, want their work to be praised in order to learn

Students the feel themselves in a position to learn when they do not give their best effort and it is praised

There are many students that deserve their work to be praised to build self-esteem, because they have really tried their best in order to get their work done, but there are many students who do not deserve their work to be praised, especially if they have not tried their best on their work. Those students who try their best on their work, they deserve their work to be praised, so that they can notice that the real hard work that they have done is appreciated. It would make them keep their hard work.

There are some people that truly believe that true self-esteem comes from achievements. It makes a lot of sense, because achievements come from real hard work. If any student achieved what they wanted, it meas that they had worked hard for it. If people want to build true self-esteem through achievements it is a great idea that they have that on mind, because it would make them feel especial if they achieve it through hard work.

There are many circumstances where it depends on the type of people and situation where you want to build self-esteem. For instance, there are certain type of people that even if you praised their work will not keep it to build self-esteem. There are certain type of people that will. There are people that learn by achievements in order to build self-esteem.

In conclusion I think that true self-esteem comes from both, achievements and praising. There are people who build self-esteem trough the hard work that has been praised, but also achievements. There are many type of people that build self-esteem trough achievements, but also praising.                                   ",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0
E21C97204867,"Changing the cafeteria food for students would be like taking a bone away from a dog. One of the reasons why changing the school lunch would be a bad idea is because, students that attend the school would not be happy with the change. When students are unhappy with changes of the schools sometimes parents can get involved and that brings a bad reputation for the school board. One day I was watching a show and they were making school changes without the students or parents consent and it turned into a big thing. Students were so angry the went on a ""strike"" and refused to go to school.

Another reason why taking away students favorite food would be a bad idea is because students would stop eating at school. For example, when I went to a family dinner they made meat loaf and I absolutely hated it, I couldnt bring myself to finish it and I felt extremely bad but i had to throw it away. Another example is also similar to my last one but, one day my friends and I went to a buffet and they didnt have a lot options to choose from, we ended up getting these wings and it was just awful we could not eat it all. When people see things they do not like then they most likely will not eat it or even try it out.

Lastly, changing the cafeteria food would leave students with less options to choose from. It would be unfair for those who dont like what they are serving and they would have nothing else to eat. Look at it like this, its like when you go out to your favorite shopping store and they have taken out all the clothes you loved so much about that store and they replaced it with clothes you hate. You would be very unsatisfied if that wouldve happen to you. Thats what students would feel if the school lunch were to change.

Some people say that changing to a healthier school lunch would be a lot better for students; Although, this is a good point, its wrong because it misses the fact that some students would be unhappy with this decision. These are some reasons on why changing the menu would be a bad idea for the school.  ",3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5

Ever since I was a little girl I would occasionally ask my dad to sing to me and ever since then I've always been passionate about singing.

This one time we did a singing contest that went on for hours and it turned out to be a tie. So we did a rematch and she won that rematch. So we had another one then I won.

Singing has been helping me relieve my stress a lot lately. Because since SOL's are like right around the corner I've been singing to just get my mind off everything that's stressful.

E2FC55BF5005,"The idea of creating a new menu for the cafeteria affects people who are trying to have a healthier diet, and kids who need to be clean of bad supplements for the sports season. Otherwise, Students that come to our school since freshman year love the tradional food of the cafeteria.

It is a good idea to include the new recipe of food in the cafteria menu because, it will have more types of vitamins, proteins, and all type of good suppliments that a young healthi body needs. Also, Teachers agree that would be a good upgrade for the students to have a extra meal that is healthier and it is in a good quantity. If the changing in our menu happens, the students that do sports will have a second meal to support all the exercise that is needed for the soccer teams, football, etc...

In some others opinion, the new menu in the cafeteria will affect the businness in our school, beacuse the students that are in the school for a longer time will not like to change their favorite types of food.

Some students might not agree with the changing of the recipe in the cafeteria, but for those reasons, the principal and teachers agree that the new menu would be a healthier and more elaborated meal for everyone in our school.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0
E36B406AFE70,"Although it may seem like being active helps us accomplish more is better, but it's actually true that inactivity also serves a purpose to. Three reasons why I think being inactive is that I have time to rest, I can catch up on any t. v shows, or I can hire a butler to do the cleaning around my house. Some people are always being active and have no rest: thats not good because the human body is not used to so much work being done. I think in a certain point of life inactivity will serve a purpose because people will be tired of all the work hey done and will just want to rest.

While being inactive there will be time where you can rest. Last year when I worked, I was so tired of the job I had received because I was hot and thirsty out in the sun all day picking up trash. Then one day when I was off, I spent my whole day resting. This served me a purpose because I was able to rest and get my energy back up to work another time. When I was resting I slept up to about 10 hours because I was very exhausted, and gloomy. While I was resting in bed I had time to catch up on bills and any other things that have to do like call in an order for some groceries. Resting this day helped me catch up on everything I needed

On weekends, when i'm at home and i'm lazy some times I call a butler to come to my house and clean everything. There is a show named Jessie, and on this show they have a personal butler named Bertrum, and he travels with them also: he cleans up for them, cooks food, and he even has to open doors for them. This helps them because while they are trying to rest he is doing mostly everything they need to do. In my opinion, I think he's doing too much work than he is supposed to because it can be overwhelming. Jessie and her kids are very lazy because they basically make Bertrum do everything; that serves a purpose but then not because Bertrum will be exhausted all time.

When resting at home I have a chance to catch up on t. v shows that I like: like Master Chef, Wild n Out, and also Real House Wives of Atlanta. No one can tell me to not watch it because I am going to be inactive and have a peaceful day where I have time to myself. The reason why I want to catch up on t. v shows is because, most of the time I dont have time because of work, or i'll be caught in a family emergency.

Overall, some people might think doing something will make you accomplish something isn't always true. In the world today there are a plenty full of people who are inactive, they sit there and do nothing but have business calls on the phone. I think it would be better for us to work at home and be idle thank to go to work and be very tired. Though some people may not agree with me its better to live that way so you can preserve your energy. Determine never to be idle doesnt always make me accomplishing something; putting my mindset towards that goal helps me reach that goal even if i'm idle.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5
E3DF63035440,"I am agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. It is true that to be success first, you need to have a clear mind of what you want to be or to do. Because in some of the cases can be very struggle and difficult to be success. For example, a very famous statement says,

""After the storm comes the calm.""

This can be similar with the Churchill's statement. Because this explain that it does't matter how worst you see it but it would be great after the problems or you are struggle with.

Furthermore, to be successful you would pass by a hard things, for example something that people says,

""Nothing is impossible if you don't tried.""

and

""Nothing is easy in this life.""

This is a true statement that all people have to do and we have to know.

Additional, the word

""failure""

plays an important role to be success. One important thing is that if somebody loss her or his enthusiasm or will power can be worst because that means that you are giving up what you have already and for that you already worked for it and don't want to fight that victory of success anymore. Sometimes you can fail but that does't matter because if you tried and tried again and again after you can get it. That would be one of your goals that you would remember. This shows how important is going from failure to failure to be success.

Finally, to be success we would failure first because by that you would know what you did wrong and thats why failure pursuit an important role in our life to be success.",3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0
E4124757C2B0,"I

disagree with adding one and half hour to school each day because students would get tired and it would be more things to the students have to know.

In our school we have 9 hours of school and if we add it would have 10 and I don't think students want to stay in school for a long time. I get that school is a place where you learn and school get's you a job and you can get a free scholarships to college without paying but at the same time students need 7 hours maximum so they would fit all the knowledge and all the subjects in there mind.

Teachers want students to learn more because they want student's to have a successful life and learn more but student's have less time to listen because they want to go home .In our school we have 4 subjects were we have tests and some students fail it because there studying for other classes even though it's not important like for example,elective classes,I get that elective is important to but students but it's really not important. The important classes are Math,Science and Language arts, and History. The school board is not gonna like when students fail there tests when they have 10 hours in school each day. Students should have time when they get home to study so they can ace there test,Since our school is a Middle school we should have less hours so we can pass 6th,7th and 8th grade without having any difficult in school.

Students wouldn't benefit if the time is longer they would not even pay attention to the teacher so i disagree with having one and half hour to school each day. On the other hand,I think i could agree to this because in order to become successful you have to study and work really hard and get enough to time to do your work.

I think students would go to college if they had a lot of time and students would understand things better we should have a vote where students decide whether we should have one and a half hour or not so then the school board can see which one got the highest votes and they would decide if we should have a longer time or regular time. This year a lot of students are getting bad grades because there is so many tests and works they have to do and it's always do on time so i feel like we should have less time in school so when you get home you have a study time.

The school board will like this idea because being in school for us is so much and there is no point for staying 10 hours in school because teachers would get tired and students will get bored. Students have a lot of work they have to do so it's better to stick with 9 hours of school and let student's go home and do there homework and then read and study for the next day of school.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0
E4643D2ADD0A,"People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. I agree, because it gives them more experience to use their brains more, it makes people develop more, and it helps you from being dependent all the time.

Using your instincts gives people more experience to use their brains more. Some people don't use their common sense to solve problems, because they're afraid that they're going to make it worse. It's okay to make mistakes. For example, If you're going on a trip with your family, and you find out that there's going to be a traffic in the morning, what will you do? Wake up early in the morning before the traffic forms. That's how you use your brain. You think and plan ahead before things go bad.

People developing more is great for your brain, because it makes you smarter and brighter. More ideas can be useful if you put your mind into it. For example, if you want your boss to be impressed by you, you need to act and use your instincts to create new ideas. It can help you be successful and more reliable.

Instincts help you from being dependent all the time, because you won't be able to be with your friends forever. You have to use your common sense to help you along the way to your adulthood. Having a couple of friends is nice, but your going to have to act and deal with life yourself. For example, you're in your apartment and you need to pay a bill for your car. You're going to have to call the bank that you want to pay for that car. Your friend does not need to tell you to pay for the things that you own. Being independent is important in life.

In Conclusion:

Some say that people who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas, because it gives them more experience to using their brains more, makes people gain more common sense, and it helps you from being around your companions all the time.

Counterclaim: Not everyone can use their common sense, because they're not born that way. Sometimes, people don't know how to be independent, or maybe they just don't want to. For example, those who have no sight can not see what they're doing. Those who are deaf, cannot hear the people who are talking.",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0
E508BAFC3BF9,"Yes I agree with this quote, beacuse every students have a chance to learn, so in my opinion, I think that is a great opportunity, for all of them to learn. Some of them has a job, maybe with that same job. I think some of them they have a chance to surpport they family.

Maybe they leave lonely, far aways from they family, or they have to help theire parent pay the rent, or other stuff to pay in they own too.

I think they will have a benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because the schools give them a new way to progress.

First of all I think it's would be a great benefit is, at same same time you can do other activity, and you can took it whenever you want, before or after work it all depend on what you think will be better for you.

Secondly if you have some family problem or you have to go somewhere immediately for a long time. That is an opportunity for you to learn or to not loss all the days you have been absent at the school.

An other opportunity is if you go to college and you have a job at same time, if your classes are in the morning fron 8 AM to 4 PM, and you job schedule is at 1 PM to 11 pm .

At that time you have this big opportynity to sturdy and learning online, before work and you have some time left to do your homework, or other thing that you have to or you want to do in that day.

Im my opinion i think people say that because with the person that they are talking to or they are meeting does not show interest on them.

The first impression is not the best sometimes, but that it does not mean that it can not be changed. You can not classify or judge a person for their first impression because that person can change.

One reason why you do not have to say that first impression is almost impossible to change is because if the person that you are meeting is not having a good day that can affect the first impression because he/she is not going to be comfortable talking or having a conversation in that moment.

If i would have to give an example it would be the history of me and my best friend.

The first time when i met him was in my math class, He did not even wanted talk to me and be my partner, when i asked him about problems that i did not understand he ignored me and he did not answer.

To conclude If i would have to to take a position on this issue i would disagree, the reason why i would disagree is because in my circle of friends there is 2 of them that they did not give me a good impression and if you look at us today we are good friend and that is why you do not have to say that the first impression is literally impossible to change.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
E52C094A1DAA,"Having good attitude can be helpful by, helping others when they have a hard time in something, and when you and I are going through tough times, you can also have a good attitue a good minset on what your doing.

A way of having a good attitude is by seeing things n the bright side of things, even though it's bad. Another reason why having a good attitude is important, is because people appreciate when someone gives them a good feeling either their sad or mad. Another reason why its important to have a good attitude is becasue you get things done properly, for an example, when you have to do a project due in two days you take your time and don't rush, you do things with a good attitude. If not your project will be at the end a mess, and you're going to be frusterated.

Having a good atitude is impotant because, you can help other when they're going trough tough times, for an example, whn my mom was sick and she was dealing with asma, we had to take her to the ER mant times. It was sad for me to see her all sick, not only that but she was pregnat and could'nrt anything because she had acid reflux. So whenever she felt sad and stressed out, I knew I had to support her and have a good attitude. By having a good attitude I had to help her with some house hold things because she could'nt really do anything.

Another reason of having a good attitude is by also having a good mindset, because when you have a good minset you can go through your tough times easly. And when you are stresse out abput something you have to have a good minset and a good attitude. For an example when I had to deal with by spine problembecause my disk was moved,I had to hae a good attitude because if I am ther complaining about my pain, it's not going to help me. So if I just relax and take rest and tak my medications then I will have a good attitude, because I know that everything will be okay.

So this is why having a good attitude is very helpful, because you can help others when they are going through tough times, or whenever you and I are going through tough times, and how it helps you succed in things.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0

I would agree because some acts of honesty can really mean a lot to someone. An old proverb says honesty is the best policy because it is the key of telling the truth and it can also create new friend ships in life.

I would agree that honesty is the best policy, but if you miss treat honesty it can be very lethal to your trust with people. To lose someone's honesty is very hard I have seen car crash which someone got severely hurt and the person who crash into him won the court battle because he was not showing honesty. My father has told me honesty is a great part in peoples life. My father has told me stories were his friends have seen people get robed and their honesty has helped find who did it and convict the criminal. Even just a little bit of honesty can help anyone. But when you use honesty you should never use it in a way that might hurt someone's feelings. I once was playing a game and the opposing team was not being very honest which hurt some of the kids feeling's on my team. But a persons honesty can always change at all times. I once had a friend who was never honest but changed through out his life and started to realize why honest is so important. I even have made new friend ships in life just from being honest. As we can see you might be able to get something from being honest.

If you are always honest people respect you. I have been in instances ware honesty has created respect for me. When you show some form of honesty it creates a good environment around you which can make good relationship you. But when people use honesty to hurt your feelings by not being honest it makes you feel like you just have been hit by a train or it feels like you have been betrayed. Once I was walking down my street and saw that there was lots of police cars out side one my neighbors houses. I heard that she got robed a couple months ago and found a witness that saw who the thief was because the witness was honest with the police it helped find who did the crime. As I can see honesty is the best policy.

In conclusion, no matter the incident that happened you always should be honest. Even in the future your actions can be justified from your honesty. Honesty is the best policy because it impacts you to do the right thing and creates a good environment. When being honest it shows that you have a high self steam which is can be very good for you in the long run.                                ",3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5

E6EF69520940,"Most of the times, the students don't get the help they need by the school. The reason for this is because some teachers don't really care about whether the students are learning or not, but about their money. Also, some students get bullied by other students and there is no one who could defend them. This happens in a many schools, such as schools in Mexico, United States, Central America, etc. So, in my opinion, attending classes at home is a great option for the students.

Classes online, well known as ""homeschooling"", is a method in which students can do the assignment of their classes at home in their computer. This idea emerged because there is many conflicts that school has to deal with, for example discrimination, and violence and between the students. So, thanks to the advances of technology, the school can provide their services at home. Is a great method, but not as going to the school, sit in your chair and learn. This method has its advantages, but also its disadvantages.

One of the advantages attending classes online is that is more comfortable and secure for the students. For example, the rate for shooting will be reduced, and the students will not suffer any discrimination against other students. Another reason are that it is less stressful because the students would more time to complete any work. Also, it helps the students to better subject. For example, students can watch videos about any specific subject, observe the procedures, and replay them if they are confused. Also parents can supervise their children and help them if they need, and they would not have to worry about attendances.

Classes online are a great benefit for students but they their disadvantages as well. For example there will be no jobs for teachers who really want to teach, share experiences to their students, and help them to improve in their lives. Another example is that students would not communicate with other students and would not know the importance of Team Work. Also, they would not have an experience by doing activities (such as playing sports, instruments, going to filmstrips, etc,)

which help them to develop useful skills. Another disadvantage is that schools would not have alternate classes that helps them to chose the career they want to. For example construction, cosmetics, arts, music, engineering, technology, etc.

In conclusion, attending classes online is a great method, but not as much as going to the school. The school is always going to be a learning center. If the school applies more fair rules, the students would feel more safety and gain a lot of confidence. Also, the school has to have better teachers who really want to help their students and not teachers that only care about their job.

To fallow this model of conserve energy and resources we have to know the reason to adopt if this model can benefit or not the school , following this model the school can confront many problems also can have many benefits but there are many reasons why the school have to follow this model and why school don't have to follow,

First,

we will talk about the disadvantages, extending two hours to the school days will be weary for the students, students will gonna be tired in the classroom and that's not benefit the students, if having eight hours in a regular week students feel tired, so adding two hours to the class days will be disastrous to the students.

Students, teachers would be affect by this changes the reason why can be affect is because they will not have time to pass with their families or things that they need to do after school.

Many students from school works to help their families or because they are living alone and they need to work to provide their personal things,

so they will not have time and that's will be a reason why they can left the school.

Students from the sports teams, club members will be affect because most of their activities are after school,so if the school adopt the new model that is adding two hours to the regular calender all they can be affected because of time.

Teachers also can be affect because they have personal life they need to grade the students work and in this new calender they can't do all.

People who works in schools will be affected because they will have one day off of their regular week.

Parents and Students will not feel comfortable they can be disagree with this change and this can cause conflict with the school principle and this can bring many other conflicts follow this model can bring many changes where the students can be benefits by this change of the new calender, also teacher people who works in school can be benefit.

One reason can be the four days of school that means the students will have three days off.

Students can have more time to do the homework because most students work during the weekend and they don't have time to do the homework so they will have an extra day to do all the things that they need to do.

students can learn more and this can be a reason to change the calender, adding two hours to the schedule will help the students because they will have more time to learn.

Also teachers can be benefit because also they have to evaluate the students and they have just the weekend to do that and that is short time , so they will have one day to grade and do all that they need to do.

all the the people are benefit because they have time to pass with their families or do whatever that they need to do, a lot of students work so they can work in this extra day.

In conclusion extending the school days and the four days of school week have many benefits and many disadvantages . As we can see there many things that can benefit the school but also there are many disadvantages .

I think the school have to be stay with the same calender, actually the schedule works great so I think there is no reason why we have to change. ",3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0

Then, I want to change the work,because I tired of the chefs,fire,bad manager or bad pay, and I can look for another job.

Now I start again,because I take a different job like a Secretary. Now I to learn new things,because I not work with food again, now I start with papers, computers and minister calls.

So this is the Surprise,the life change all the time,but we need to have positive attitude and face up to all the bad things that coming.

Is the same with the school, some times the attitude change,because is impossible that somebody knows all the information about one class or two. We have differents impressions impossible to change. Because some people hate some class, for example math, but some liked. Normally I hate this class, because is just number,equations,square rules. I disagree with this class, but I know that in the future I need. But all we have differents positions, because some people love the numbers and others love another class for example, I like History why. The reason is that I like learn new things that I don't know, is very interesting.

But, I agree with one thing, all the class are very important for my life, because in the future I can take any job because I know differents things for differents carrers and I can help to other people in any class.

We are agree in one thing. Wherever we going always the school is very important in our life. I know that we can disagree in differents things,but I think that is impossible to change the scary impression why, because always we scary to fail but, I agree that we can fight for change the future and achieve everything that we want.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,2.0,2.5
E7A9FD471BE3,"Graduating earlly should be a good idea because students are abkt to accomplish it early, students may have goals in life they want to achive and they might have other responsibilities to take care off. Some poeple said that graduating early is a good idea becasue students can relive some stress but some student say that is not a good idea because students may miss the best year of thier life. So thinking about it, should you graduate early or not.

First of graduating early is a goog idea because of the responsiblity a student have outside of school. Students may have work or some issue that are not school base things. For example my friend had a kid. She graduated early last year, now shes able to go to college or go to work force while taking care of her kid. Some student may have sport team outside the school that may help them to be professional player. For example soccer players can go professional without going to college. Beach Fc or anyone soccer club out there may help those players become a pro.

Seconly. Students may want to acoomplush it early as possible. Students may want to graduate early becasue thet want a time off school before going to college. Students may be sick of going to school because of how many lesure are there everyday. For example my friend graduate early last year because he wanted to get it done early. He wanted to step back for a bit before going to college. Going to school is stressfull enough for students, Exams, Sol, Text, ect. Students use this meated to have a years off school before going to college or going stright to work force,

Thirdly. Students may have goals in their life that they wanted to accomplish early after school. Students may have a sport team that are able to help they turn into a pro. or a gaming team to turn them a pro. students have a lot of goals in there life also. Graduating early may help them to get a head start so they wont be falling behind with people. I read a story once that a guy that graduted early. He became a proffetional soccer player on are 17 or 18. He is a incredible player, One of the best in the world.

If a student could graduate early; the students can accomplish things that they couldn't after highschool. if a student can graduate, they can focus on other responsinilities outside of school. If I can graduate early, I can accomplish my goals early than others. Graduating early can be a good idea. for example student may graduate early becuase of they're responsibilities outside of school, students may have goals in life that they want to accomplish first or a student just wanted a time off school. You have a chose. take it or leave it.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0
E7DB2DC8B151,"I think curfews do keep teenagers out of trouble and it helps them sleep on time because after those hours a lot of law breaker are on the streets and something bad could be happening outside or on the streets like gang fights , shootings , robbers , durg dealers, drunk drivers and many more. The first reason is shootings mostly happens at night late after 10 p. m and it would be better to stay inside in those hours than to go outside and for example a teenager is walking home from a friends house late in the midnight and gets in a fight with gang member and gets shot. while it would have been better with the curfew in place.

Curfews help teenagers go to sleep on time well like on the weekdays when they got school the next day and sleep on time and wake up on time and be refreshed for a test or something for example a teenager has school the next day and since he does not have a curfew he sleeps late and he misses the bus and forgets he has a test that day. And another example a teenager has a game he does not sleep early and he wakes up tried and is not able to play the game as well as he could.

Curfews could also help teenagers mange their time appropritely and how they spend the day for example a teenagers has a project or a home work the curfew time will help know what he/she must do first before he/she have some free time and goes to sleep.

In conclusion adopting the curfew idea would be good because it will keep the teenagers out of trouble and help them mange their time appropritely.",3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0
E8BF036DCFA5,"Students should participate in extracurricular activities

I believe students should participate in extracurricular activities because one it keep them out of trouble, two some of the activities keep them healthy, and three they are fun.

One reason students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they keep most students out of trouble. For example, it can keep the students occupied so they don't have to be on the streets. Another example is sometimes these activities can help them relax and keep them calm so they stay out of trouble.

Another reason is some of the activities can keep them healthy. For example students can do football or basketball which keeps them running and keeps them in good shape. They can also do lift training after school which keep them fit and all around healthy.

Last but not least these activities are fun. There are always a lot of activities and you can always find something you like. For example if you like sports there are so many different sports you can do. There are also other things like drama club if you like acting, art club if you like drawing, even robotics club if you like technology and stuff like that.

Therefore these are the reasons I agree that all students should do at least one extracurricular activity.",3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0

The author Waldo Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, about to be individuality. I disagree with him because there are many occasions that you need help from someone in life. Is not just to be individual is to know how to management your life in your time. In this essay i will talk about some ways the we can work together. Firts i will explain about, job issues and results. Second i will explain about society, and how can be relative to be not a individual person. Finally i will expain how to take decisons, and to make them work. This may prove that individuality doesn't change the you can not be, what you want be.

There are many ways the can be a ocation of individuality. In your job, might be someone you do not like, because his or her behave. You can try to work with the person, is not just be a individual person, beause you might need the help of the person one day. If your try to work with the person to broke the individuality between the person in you, that can be a avance to be relative to other people. Another occasion on individuality in your job can might be because, you are not doing what you dreamed about to be in the future. The doesn't mean the you can not fight to get your goal, if you don't like your job try to do something the you like been working in a job that you don't like is typical of individuality behave. Many companies work together as a team to get there goels, you can work with other people in your job as a company.

Some people prefert to be alone in many times, these people we can know as asocial. This people just want to be alone becuase they feel comfortable like that. There another people the doesn't like to be around others people, because they like to do the things by there own. They like to be the one the everyone see, the point of attention these people we can call as indiviluatys. Not all them are the like that, because there might be a reason to makes them to be like that. Maybe for their background. Be around of society is sometimes is more complicate then what it looks, mostly if you know people like that, but you can try to work with them or somethings these people chage. Some them beacuse they look for help and others change because someone close to them help to change for good.

We all make decisions in life but some those decisons can make us to do something wrong or to be a different person. Try to be anoter person is not just to want to be the person is to make a decision. You can make the decision to be push it by the world, or you can make your own decision of what you want to do in life. Many people take the decision to stay in a world that management their life, because they think the is better or because is the easy way. The president can deciside to work alone, and make the things as he wants but he knows the he needs to work together, we the people in the congress beacuse by himself can not do everything. As the president we can make the same, decision as him to work together or not. you can make your own goal to fight for what you want or to be constantly push it by the world to change you to be something else.

In summary we all have the decision to select which way to follow. As i went throught about job and result. Also i wrote about hoe we can live around the society, and how we can result conflicts. Finally i explaned how we can take are own decision, to be what we want to do, and what can be goal to follow to change, or fight for it. This can be a result the Ralp Waldo Emerson, is wrong about to be push it by the world constantly, beacuse you change that and be what you want to be.",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5
E969EF7D2D8A,"Given students a long summer opportunities would give them the chance to take a restful break from all the ethic school year they have being having.

Most students enjoy summer break vacation. but some educators feel that the summer is too long because students has a long summer vacation would take the time to review their school year and go to summer school for makeup class while others are planing to spend time with their families . Though others are thinking that students should have a year round school where there would be a three to four weeks in the summer and a longer winter break but meanwhile a week off in spring and fall break because during snow days the students would have no school and they would get to go to school while it really cold outside. I think it not a great idea because Most students thinks the long summer is a great opportunity for them to participate in some various positive activities and for them to sets a standard goal for themselves.

Most students should get a long summer break because they have to take their time and review their work and go to summer school for a make up class that would help them to get credits back or graduates the coming years. Imagine have in a break during the summer, would any students have the chances of making up class work during the winter? or would they even think about the ideas of doing a class makeup?. I think no because they would be giving an excuse about the snowy weather and the real cold weather and schools would be canceling which would affects the process of curriculum on what the class are learning. for example during the winter when we sometimes gets a snowy weather we cancel schools and that one day that school get cancel it affects most teachers planing on what they should do for that day. For instance the school would have to take a week off of that summer break so that the teacher would have time to complete what he or she has to teach the students. Therefor students needs a longer summer break to succeed on their goal.

Meanwhile other students need a long summer breaks to spend a long time with their families because they has already spend a long school learn especially the once that had honors class also the students who are in college. Most students who spends some quality time with their family might have a better chance of setting up a goal for the next school year by all means because they are getting a better advice from their family, for example I had a understanding that students who spent the most time with their family discussing their school year would get motivated and has a goal for themselves before the new school year, meanwhile in the winter break, you wont have that much time to spend with your family, because most of your family who live far across would most likely not want to come visit because of the winter. For example when during the winter most of my family who lives abroad or out of states would never come to visit us during the winter break because they said it winter and it really cold, while in the summer each and everyone of our family would come to visit because we spend some quality time together and they always give me some good advice on how to be successful on my education and what goal I should set to gain my success.

Finally though other are thinking that students should have a year round school where there would be a three to four weeks in the summer and a longer winter break but meanwhile a week off in spring and fall break because during snow days the students would have no school and they would get to go to school while it really cold outside. With this opinion, I think am little bit agree because during the winter the snowy weather kind of disrupt everything or activities that was supposed to happened during the school year. Meanwhile another hands the students does not have to missed a week or weeks to school but a day or two. Therefor they should get a long summer break even tho they would gets a week or two off, for instance I believe if they get a a day or two there would be no chances for them to forgets everything they learned during the time school opens to the beginning of winter. for example if they miss one or two days they would have a day to revised their notes and maybe be prepare for a coming test or quiz in the future, never the ;less they wont have to study for too long for a test or quizzes again.

In conclusion

Most students enjoy summer break vacation. but some educators feel that the summer is too long because students has a long summer vacation would take the time to review their school year and go to summer school for makeup class while others are planing to spend time with their families .

because Most students thinks the long summer is a great opportunity for them to participate in some various positive activities and for them to sets a standard goal for themselves.

E9705A9C0FE5,"In this prompt i agree and disagree, because in societies now in days some students do know for sure what career they want to study/become when older. Some students don't know exactly what they want to study/ become when older. It all depends on the student, For example if the student is for sure on what they want to be when older. Thats because either since they where little they have always like firefighters or a police officer. Once growing up they notice they can become one too and follow there dream on being something they have always loved since they where young. Also it could be that there Mom or Dad, or a family member that was or in the military or a firefighter. That want to follow those steps too, and make their family members proud. They also took interest on what their family member do or have done in life.

Now for the student who are not sure of what they exactly want to be once their older/ study. Some students are actually not sure what they are interested in doing and need help finding what they would love to study about, or some students wants to explore and have options to see what they are most interested in doing for the future. Students who dont know for sure what they want to be when older , needs help finding their interest because most of the time their shy on going into a class with new people they don't know. Also in high school their are academy and sometimes the class you pick are not at the school you go to so a bus would take you to that school. And some students are scared to go to another school because they dont know that school so well. In other cases that i haven't really heard of as much as the other ones, that they are scared to study what they love because they dont want to be judged by other people or also because their parents wants them to study to become a doctor or a lawyer when really they want to be a police officer or something else that they are interested in. So its hard for them to become what they really want to be in the future.

I would agree and disagree in this prompt, i disagree because some students dont actually know what they want to be when older, and i agree because some students already know what they want to some as their career. Some are shy, some are scared, and some already know for sure what they want to study about. For example me, at first when i was little i didnt know what i wanted to be. my whole life till this day i am an animal lover. I rather live with animals then humans to be honest. So i thought of be a veterinarian, but people told me that i would have to do surgery on animals and stuff like that and at some things its good because i am saving their lives, but im not always going to save their lives so i didnt want to be a veterinarian because i didnt want to be hurt my whole life work like that. So i moved on to following my dads foot steps, becoming part of the Marine Corps. My dad was in the Marine Corps and fought in the Vietnam war, he also worked as security in the American embassy in Generic_City. I also love doing makeup, since i was little i would always play with makeup and growing up i would buy a lot of makeup but didnt really know how to use the products. until i started by little learning how to use the products. Now a big makeup store at the mall offered me a job their because they loved the way i do my makeup.

after school homework clubs would be helpful because students can understand more about what they are doing, for example when a student has difficulty in one of there subjects,and they need help they can stay after school to get a better understanding on what they need help on.

other ways after school clubs would help the students focus more on the certain problems they need, but over all after school homework clubs is a great way for students to express there knolage and there concern on what help they might need help on over all.

after school homework club can help know the children strength and weakness for example me when I stay back for math after school my teacher helps me know what I need to work on to decrease my weakness for instance, me and my math teacher she helps me go throw steps to learn easy ways to decrease my weakness in different problems that I dont understand. other ways she helps me on to decrease my weakness is by giving real life problems and showing me ways to solve them and getting the questions right .

having after school clubs can help teachers and the students know were there strength and weakness are.

the after school club can help classmates have one on one conversations on what they understand and do not understand learning from other people can help you because they might know problems that you dont understand but they do. like for instance my friends at my school they get more help from classmates then they do teachers.

having a after school club for students can bring a positive impact on them and others around them and also it can be fun. ",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

E9E68651B168,"I disagree on extending school hours. I disagree because if the school board adds more morehours to school, students won't pay much attention to the teacher or staff. Another reason is that students will start disrespecting teachers because they have too many hours and they will start to get more tired or start to go a sleep. I also think that teachers might get anoyed by students replying on why the school board added extra hours of school. I think that instead of adding the extra hours to school, the school board should just make the extra hours optional after school. This should take place after school so kids can come and learn more about life and school.

First of all, I disagree because if the school board adds more hours to school students wouldn't be able to concentrate or pay attention in class. I believe that if students don't pay attention in class or to the teacher, the teacher will get very upset and students will start to get in trouble or would start losing points. I believe that the students don't pay attention in class or to the teacher, they would begin to be disrespectful to teachers and won't be respectful to others. I believe that students should tell their parents to do something about the school board wanting to increase the amount of hours in school. Kids should work very hard and keep up the good work and not be disrespectful to others or to the teacher.

Second of all, I don't agree because I think that students will start to disrupt or question their teacher about why the school board wants to change or increase the amount of hours students have in school. They are going to start asking a lot of question and their teacher isn't going to like that. I think that students should ask the school board why they are going to increase the amount of hours in school. Students should talk to their parents on why the school board is extending the amount of hours. Students should just be able to do the normal hours of school instead of doing extra.

Third of all, I believe that the school board shouldn't increase the amount of hours the should just make it an after school activity. I think that the school board should just make it an after school activity instead of increasing the amount of school for students. The school board shouldn't extened the school hours for students because students can just study hard for something or teachers should go over the subject the are learning about so they can learn and understand. If they just stay after school theyh will get so board and they wouldn't want to be there.

Then the other choice not having a career in a young age,living their life to the fullness plus spending time with family and friends. you dont have to worry so much about paying bills and other things.

Other way to enjoy these amazing parks is by visiting it with you're families.

It will take a while for you to see the prove but probably not to long but the results will come at one point and don't doubt it. however, with your first impressions you will represent yourself to the people or the way you act or the way you act in the beginning it will make them know if your child dish, immature, or the opposite.

If you put that respect and honesty in the beginning people will treat you with respect but if you like to mess with people yell at them without respect don't expect something else because it will come back to you and there's this verse in the Bible that I like that says "" what you plant, thats what will grow"" I don't think i wordily got it right how i said so what its meaning is if you're a lair don't be mad or don't ask God why is he doing this to you because that's what you planted in the beginning. When you meet a person what are the first impressions you get of that person on how they look, act and talk. When I first came in Generic_Name class and actually met her, my first impression was she's very nice, knows how to properly talk to students and as time pass I got my points proved right. Sometimes it is almost impossible for first impressions to change but its never to late it could come to the time it does.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5
EB5924FBD25C,"Although some say schools shouldn't extend the school day two hours because some students and teachers might have work after school, actually schools should extend the school day two hours because students get enough time to do their assignments and home works also teachers got enough time to check students work properly and students can add one more subject.

Some people say that schools shouldn't extend the school day two hours because some students and teachers might have work after school. But if we see that in another way instead of working after school sixteen hours with in four days we can just work eight hours in our three days weekend. also it is wast energy for instance, there is one student who works after school for three days until 5:00 pm - 11:00 pm. He came at school by 3:30 pm and he works at seven eleven which is the hardest place to work. It takes 15 minute to go and he have to at 4:45 pm to reach his destination on time. And then let's see after work he gets home at 11:00pm then he sleeps at 12:00 am. How can he focus on he's classes? this person is losing 2 things;

1, losing energy

2, not focusing on his classes he might fail the classes that he is taking

The student that wants to extend the school day will have enough time to do their assignments and home works, also teachers get more time to check the students work properly because they probably got 3 days off if is there any meeting or doing some things in school for example, if the government decide there is a meeting every Friday. However, it is better for teachers to do their work as an example they can check students work on one day of their breaks and they can relax, hangout, playing with kids etc. Students also can do what every they want if we see one example, one student can finish his assignments and other school stuffs in one whole day and the rest of the the weekend is his he gets enough time if he get enough time then he is free from school for two days if he continue work on it he got 2 days free every weeks. In addition those who needs long time to study this schedule can help the students that who wants more time work on it.

Learning is gaining knowledge, so that in these schedule students can add one more subject. How ever, based on this idea two argument comes from the students who wants to add extra class and the students who wants to extend the normal class by adding one hour for each classes.

Adding one hour for each classes is better to have the experience to sit for two hours and 30 minute in one class. And also it's good to work long time on one subject, but as we see in high school student this idea is trash. It can work for only in college class based on that the college students said that ""one man trash is another man's treasure"". When I come with my idea students can add one more subject because it is Better to get credit on that class and students can choose 3 or more elective classes . For example one student wants to take 3 classes that he have to take and pass for graduate high school he wants to learn 2 classes that helps him in the future. In Virginia law you have to take English 12 and Maths classes. Also to graduate high school it require Personal and Financial Economics to take it. those 3 classes are History, Biology, and one elective class to get a full credit. If the school can only learn 7 subjects this student is going to add another 1 year to learn only one class.

Finally Schools should extend the school day two hours because students get more time to do things that they have to do and it also useful for teachers they can get enough days off. Also teachers work harder than students, so that teachers work 4 days and 3 days off. And Students can add one class to get more credit.                                                                                 ",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5

Hello I hope you doing well, my name is Generic_Name. The present letter is to let you now that I'm fascinating of your business management, and I'll be glad to visit it. As you probably know many students are compelling to participate, indagate, and discover about distintic occupations in the work place. I think that it will be the most exiting thing that I could do because probably I can find an appropiated place of my interest to work at.

In fact, I can learn about the resposability and most of the times the presure that some workers have. The importance of follow the rules, every little thing in the work place it could be important for me in the future.

To adapt in differents positions and the most imporatnt thing is to love what I would do, to be an applicated, and apassionated person in the place that I would like.

Nevertheless, many people hate their work because they never had the chance to visit many different places that they wanted, couldn't achive their goal or may be the postion that they wanted was alredy taken by someone else.

The resposability at work has to be the most important, if a worker doesn't have the resposability in their job it will be a big problem, they might not care about the job and the things that their boss asked for.

I would like to be the person who has the responsability and all the interest of my job, and be proud of myself by doing the right things.

Althought, I can learn day by day how to impprove without an advice of the manager and be the best worker in my area. Many people think that work is only to get money, and bored and they are there just because they need to pay their bills, the main reason of work is to love what you like and enjoy doing it.

EEE6067CF9B5,Some schools have programs that older kids can help younger kids. If they don't know how to somethings in school or out side of school. Or they are there just there to assist other kids that more help then other kids this can be helpful. For older kids that they might have to teach something new that they did not know or just teach something that they had some hard time in when they where leaning this in school. And can be more helpful for younger kids because they might have to work a little more harder and get more. Challenged more then they get at home or school and they get through there homework at this after. School program and then when they get back to school they have there homework done and then there homework. Might not be late or they might just be more on top of there stuff and when they get home they just can relax and play some games or just go outside. And have good jobs later in there lives and I think that more kids should have this. Chance to get this time to study and get better programs in there school. Because we have good programs and then if most of every school have likes programs they can get help by older students and younger students can help they older can help by helping the younger and the younger if they are not doing homework and if they are done with home work they can help other younger students. so they can get the help and the assisting that need or might need because if you are good with some like math but then the homework gets harder they might just need just need some more time or more time study and going over there past home work to see if he can or she can solve that problems or if they can't that why there are the older student. That can them help he or she with the home work or projects. They can help one and other to finish faster and get their projects done if they wish to or they can just work on it just by them self. and then when most of the kids are done with homework witch most won't be they might go on there computers or they can go outside and play some outside games witch so half would go out side and the other will stay to keep this program fun and not just doing homework and classwork all day long. So they can keep or gain some energy to when they are done form playing they can comeback inside with some.

EEEF81C2E133,"I am writing this prompt to inform you about the position for hiring. I would be very delighted if I could be hired by you. I do not have experience at all but, I can show you that I am a good candidate for this job and I could handle the job very well. Here are some few reason why I would be a good candidate for the job.

One reason on why you should hire me is that even though I don't have experience I tend to learn really fast and do multiple things at a time. Usually I memorize them very easily. It has a greater impact on me because I learn fast and customers are more happy with the service. Also, I could do many things at a time which is good for the job and good for the customers.

For example, in some restaurants it takes long for someone to do your order or even get to your table to get your order. It is better if you have someone that is fast and shows that the customers are there number one priority. It is good that the customers feel welcomed and feel important when the workers are giving them attention.

Another reason is that I have an amazing, outstanding attitude with people. I am a very joyful person and what I feel like is right, is giving joyfulness to customers who need it. For example, I have friends that sometimes have had a rough day and I tend to help them and make them happier and change their perspective to a better one. I think it is good that if a restaurant has someone happy and joyful the customers would want to come in because its a very joyful place. My goal is always to see poeple smiling and keept encouraging them to always be happy.

The restaurant can always make more money when customers feel like its there home.

Lastly, I like meeting new people at jobs and working as a group. What I love to do is bringing everyone together and making new friendships.

I've seen that when working as a groups it is better because you get things done faster. You also make greter connections with your coworkers. For example, If someone needs something for a customer and your busy doing something else its better to ask a coworker to help you out. I like bringing bonds together and working with them.

These are some of the reason I would love to get the job. I want to learn something new thats not from my perspective. I love trying new things and getting to know the different types of jobs around the community. I also learn very fast and I love being commited to anything and working as a group. I hoppe you consider me to work there and I would be very happy. Thank you for your time. ",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0

High Schools Program shoud be a way to help the future profesional to find what they are really want to be in the future, high school stage is one of the most important step for the young age students, Because there is when they choose their future, We need to work with them the best way is posible, We need to find out a programs that impulse them to continue students after high schools graduate.

In some case parents try to tell their children what career they have to take, In that case if the students have to choose a career by the time they are entering to the high schools, Most probably will be their parents choosed what career they are going to take it, So that may be a mistake for the student because when they finally found themself, Probably they realize there were something else more interesting for them that they could take it, At that time would be too late.

Also some students may take a career that doesn't make the money they were expecting, or choosing a career that's not fit for them,

What the high school should be concern about is to form the best profesional for the future, Teaching them the best educations is posible and the same way showing them what kinds of career are there,The advantage and the disadvantage all the career have it.

High schools programs should know they're playing a really impotant roll in the future of the country, However the programs needs to be concentrated, should be educated the young guys the best way is posible,

Create a programs to keep them away from problems like; Grugs, Alcohols, Gangs.

RE: Classes online

Not bacause I take classes online many of the students will not be responsible and they miss many grades, They will even have not internet in online classes for be doing their own things at home for example, if i have online classes i would be distranted by my brother or other things and i feel that my online classes is not would not be good idea like i say that online class is not a good idea there are many distraction. also, if we have that problem I think that beging with teachers is the best idea cause they help us a lot in the amies.

The firs reason is not all student have the internet in the houses some students don't have the internet because their parents don't have too much money to but one or maybe because they don't have the tecnology. One friend told me that their parents think that the tecnology is bad for him because it is distraction and he needs to focus on his future. and if he dosen't take that class online he will fall that class. every parents think different.

Another reason because not all student are not responsibles. some student came to school but they don't do anything' but it the teacher letf them that they need to do this, they do it, because they feel pressure and they know that the fall the class but is their class is online they will no care about the class, And they don't will take care about the class.

The conclusion is tha bad idea take classes online because the internet is one of the things that they need it, anbd not all the students have it, they need to have their responsability the class and not to all the student care for their classes, and the last thing is because not al the students like to have classes online because they know that they can't consentrate in their house bacause all the noise around.

Now you don't think the same about the product that you fall in love at first impression.

First, I disagree about First Impressions statement. The feeling of first impressions everybody have it, but is not impossible to change it. I would give you a example of how your first impressions can be change. For example you see a nice car for sale in you way home and you stop by to see the car because you are in love with the look of the car. The owner of the car let you try it and when you get inside, car interior is ruined and a lot engine problems. Now your first impressions is ruined just like the car you thought look nice. Next weak you see another car for sale close to your house, but this time the car does not engine problem and ruined interior like the last car you try. Your first impressions from a car for sale change.

Second, this is my experiences with first impressions. When I was 13 years old I thought that my sister phone have the best camera ever and best software ever. Now in 2019 the new IPhone 11 come out and my first impression with the camera and software was a lot different from my sister phone.

In conclusion I think first impressions can be change. Just try other placer where you can find the same product with best thing. Your first impressions about last change.

F0078F48B6D1,"Im Generic_Name and my special skill/talent is that I am a competitor. I like to compete when it comes to certain things, because It motivates me to practice and work for what i want to achieve. I got my competitive spirit from my older brother. But I usually get competitive when it comes to video games or sports. But I also like to compete because I like to win.

How did my brother make me competitive? He would always say that I would lose and it would change my whole perspective of things. He would always win, so it would motivate me to practice. Me watching him practice would also make me competitive cause him practicing would motivate me to practice to try to be the best. He would also like to say that ""you're gonna lose"" and it would change my whole mood.

How does being competitive motivate me? It motivates me to practice, because it makes me want to be the best I want to be. It also motivates me more if I lose, because it makes me want to do the same thing again until i win at it. Watching my favorite sports motivate me cause it makes me want to be in those big leagues someday. My goal is to be a pro basketball player and I cant get there if i'm not competitive.

Being competitive can get you a future in anything and you should work on this skill. It will teach you life lessons, it will make you be successful, and it will teach you to work hard for what you want. You should have a goal set in mind and just go work hard and achieve that goal. Are you a competitive person? Whats your goal so you can work hard at it and achieve it?",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5
F0116D8BA334,"Do I agree that my school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours? Some of this businesses have adopted a four-day work week, without thinking about the consequences. Each day consisting of ten hours to conserve energy and resources which it would be difficult for them since they will be working ten hours per day during four days of week. Taking the model of the businesses expending school day to conserve energy and resources, with each day consisting of two hours will be a difficult choose to make. First of all the government need to be part of this decision, and need to be include to see which are the consequences going to be in taking this choose. personally i am fully disagreement with this model, but not only myself is in disagreement there is a lots of people that believe school should not follow this model to conserve energy and resources by expending the school day two hours. The government and society is the one who's need to be taking control of this decision, because they know what is good for the students and what is bad for them.

In a society it is unlike the average American work week, so it would be difficult for families to adopt to the changes. Having longer school days and shorter weeks does not align with the structure of a typical parent's work schedule. Most students being involved in extracurricular activities after school, and not being able to drive, the four day school week will create many conflicts. Parents will most likely struggle to get their children to those activities and anything involving life outside of school. Most parents would have to adjust their work schedules to accommodate for the new school hours. Also, an extra day off for students but not necessarily for parents and child care would be required for the younger students on the extra day off. Additional expenses such as that are not always easy for families to come up with. Lots of changes would be put into action. Some others believe that the positives of changing to a four-day work week outweigh the inconveniences brought on by extending the day.

Their main rational revolves around improving to transportation, building and it will be good for students to be able to have more down time.

Taking part of this i would argue that the benefits seen so shortage, like a lack in the amount needed. In real world application of this plan applied in a education settings does not posses the same bonuses. The advantage of having another day off most likely Friday, while promising, does not necessarily means a day without work to do. In fact, there is a lot of many ways that you can conserve energy and resources, some business adopt different ways to conserve energy and many resources. Although i do not like this plan that our school should fallow this model (their plan is so bad), if we start doing this plan we will be in a several problem. We usually go to school seven hours per day, and barely have time to do our homework after school. Students like me need to go work after school, since some of us are living already on our own and this plan will affect our jobs.

In conclusion the idea in adopt a four-day work week, is not the best plan to conserve energy and resources. This plan is not the best plan that this businesses company have came with. There is a lot of consequences that need to take care of, before get into the point that you can not have the right for a opinion of what to do and what not to do. In this plan i will rather say that the school should not follow any plan or anything that is not for the goods of our students. Speak with the society about it and then make a choose that it is going to effect for good or bad. Sometimes changes are goods, but not on this plan people said that there is some benefits and what i see is just disadvantages on this plan. Adopt a four-day work week, is not the only you have to save energy. There are so many ways to conserve energy and resources. Example: not use a lot of water or try no to use the electricity that much last, but very important think first and then do the use the plan or the choice that is best.

F069420C6DB7,"Some schools are offering distance learning for students to attend class from home. With online or video conferencing . I support thus idea of distance classes Because you can wake up anytime you want, Go in a slow speed to no overwhelm yourself, no one can bother you while you study.

First of you can wake up anytime you want so you can have the right amount of hours in case you work at night and you dont get seven to nine hours of sleep every night. Also you can do classes later in the day in case you want to work in the morning instead of the night. So you can have a career and have time to study to make your future come closer. It's also a good thing for people that have to stay home to look at after their sick parents or little brothers they won't have to worry at school if they are okay because they will be home taking classes and making sure everything is okay while studying.

Therefore they won't be overwhelmed about missing days or which classes he needs to make up a test or if he/she has a project coming up in class because all of that info is going to be in his/her phone or laptop. Its a better thing to have online classes doesn't take up half of your day you dont get overwhelmed with new info for like 4 different classes in one day. So you wont be stressed out as much that (study shows most kids that drop out is because they are being stressed out with so many info in just one day for like 4 different blocks in a single day). Online classes are better from what i heard it help's you better cause it teaches you what the state want's you to know instead of things you dont need to know like some side stories that teachers say to make you try to remember but end up getting lost in the story.

Finally when you do your work no one can bother you about the answer or what problem you in and they cant cheat off of you and you end up getting in trouble because they didnt stop asking or taking to you. Its also a good thing because if you don't understand you can go back a lesson to relearn it again in case you forgot how to do the problem. thats why Online classes are more proffered then actual class when you have to wake up early and go to school all tired cause you only slept a little staying up because of work or studding for the next unit so you cant fall behind or re doing a new untie while going into a new one. So i support the idea of distance learning for students and that schools are thinking about doing it would be a great idea.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0

F1620489BEB3,"I agree that changing the school lunch menu to a healthier option would be a better solution. This could help resolve some problem we have today. The top problem in the world for this topic is that many people in America are obese and numbers are growing. This also helps show a new generation the many healthier option to choose from. What i think the best thing is the amazing new foods and cultures it can be introduce to you. How many people do you know that their or your kids don't eat the school lunch cause of the food almost everyday?

In America we have gone through many tough time's but a big issue that started happening in the late 90's and early 2000's was the growth in obesed. The line for what was good and bad for you was smudged and the only thing that was okay was that it tasted good. That's why schools started noticing a change in peoples decisions for healthy or unhealthy choices. And change if not only a small bit to try and help, but that didn't mean they couldn't bring in their own food. Having a more healthier option would be good for students bodies and a better state of mind cause you know your giving your body energy and what it needs.

We go through life living the way we were raise. That also comes with the food that was given to us as teenagers and kids. All of us have at least one trait that your care giver did that now you inherited, some people drink coffee more then other cause that how they saw life as. Which is why showing kids and teenagers a better more healthier life style early show them better eating options and that all starts with what to eat for lunch at school cause your there for almost half the day.

The best part about eating a healthier life style is that you can try new and better options instead of the same lazy food. Almost every country use natural fresh produce in everything they eat cause of their culture. And showing people that might not like that idea, a food they wouldn't eat but end up loving it is the best feeling. This is also educational cause it introduces students to new culture are the world. This show's how they eat and prepare food in their country and the difference in our own lives. It's really eye opening for some people and it show kids not everything that doesn't look good is bad food.

Having a healthier option for school lunch is good but it take a lot of meal prep and it's more expensive them getting can or frozen goods. Employees that work in the lunch room are gonna have to come in more early to wash and cut fresh fruits and vegetables which means the school is gonna have to pay them more money cause their doing more. And to get the best quality produce, schools are gonna have to pay more money which some schools can't do. But the only thing that should matter is the students not this or that. The problem with schools is that their lowering down their standards with food to get things that aren't necessary. They could be using that money for better food and better silver wear items then what we have now.

Having school lunches be healthier is better for everyone even if it needs time to get use to. A better lunch can show people different and more unique foods around the globe also helps show's that not everyone's different. This also help's show people that there are better options in fresh and natural items rather then foods that have yellow dye-7. This would also help America be the country it wants to be and how Americans want other countries to see us as a stronger, mature, and all around amazing country. And show that this school is ready for change no matter what happens.",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0
F21B26DBED29,"What is your favorite thing to do during your free time? Do you stay in bed and watch movies? Do you go to your community library to read books and study? Or do you just go outside for a walk?

Studies have proven that 75% of people go to parks more often during their free time. These specific people say they usually go outside to relieve stress, and get their mind off things. This is one key factor to why you see elderly people outside. But our main focus was on modern day children and why they love going outside.

Children always want to have fun, but usually with their friends. Additional to this fact, they start to create games and activities with their friends giving them a chance in looking forward to going outside everyday. One popular game from the 1800s is hopscotch, which is surprisingly still played today. Though this game was only played by girls, through recent years we start to notice not only girls but boys and adults playing this game. Though hopscotch isn't a really competitive game and can be played alone, it's better when its played with other people.

Another game played much more often is freeze tag, or tag, which consists of two teams and two catchers and played by both girls and boys. This game involves running which can improve both your physical well-being and cardio-respiratory endurance, This game isn't usually played by adults as seen in frequent surveys, and tend to be a child only game. This game is one of the most competitive outdoor games played my modern day kids.

Comparing these two games, there is a high chance that people who enjoy running would go for tag, and serene people would go on tho playing hopscotch. Though you could still play tag being a quiet person. These are some examples of what to do when you ever want to go outside, or to the park.",4.5,4.0,5.0,4.5,4.5,4.5
F2BAC6095D8A,"I belive that students would work more effectivelly online rather, then sitting in a class room all day and not engaring in there learning rather then talking to there friends and being sociable.

When working online the student and teacher has obligations that he or she sould complete foor example a student that has a project due on wednesday and will do it ,on time and correct rather then the student, that goes to school and has the same project due on the same day there will be, more higher chances that the student working online will have it done first becuase the student has less time, to socalize with friends and has more time to stay foused on he's or her work .

Many kids have this advantage and it is a good one becuase they learn so much though out a online school rather then a public school ; becuase the class it more advanced and has for advantages for example the student ;online is taking pre calculas the student can easely tell the teacher what proble he or she is stuck on and the teacher can go over it explaning it in more it also help the student to be more engaging in there learning ; turo details rather then asking the teacher after class and not giving you a straight foward awnser .

Many student's taking classes online have the capibilidy and asset of graduating much earlyer becuase there classed are more advanced and with more potential to succed in life becuase of the parnts and the dissition that they have enrolled there kid in to online school ,rather then regular school .

F45967CEFA55,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill stated a quote that said, ""success consists of going from failure to failure with out loss."" There are 3 reasons why I agree with this statement. The first reason is, failing will want to make you push for a success, the second reason being that you'll have more of enthusiasm when you're find more ways to succesed, and the third reason is achiving for higher goals.

I agree strongly with this prompt and Winston Chruchill's quote, yet some people think it's something at may not be true and think less of them self. In the first paragraph I will explain my first reasoning with a strong example of it.

First, reasoning to this prompt would be, falling will want to make you push for success. Even though not many people think that is the way that many of our past inventors had learned. Albert Enstine was one of the smartest people out there, yet he had come face to face with failure many times in his life. The only way he learned was to try many other different ways to solve his problems. He used failure as an insperation to to keep trying like our first inventor of the light blub. Even though many people found it frusterated and diffivult when they've failed, which pushes on to my second reasoning.

Next, the reason would be that many people think different about them selfs when they fail in something. Thomas Edison thought different, even though he had failed 100 times, he had not gave up. When he finally successed, he said a quote that is in my mind till today in this presnet day. That quote was ""I didn't fail 100 times, I found 100 ways that it didn't work."" Even though, Thomas Edison had failed he maintaned him self with a lot of enthusiasm, Failure is never an option, but finding a solution to it is a success.

Finally, the last and final reason is achiving for high goals that you want to reach. It don't matter what others may think of it or if you'll be able to achive or not. Show them that they are wrong even if you come to a failure don't stop, find a solution and fix it to make it better than before. You'll reach higher goals with higher potential then what you'll ever imagine. Then later on you will be able to do anything you put your mind to and demonstrate your knowlage to the world.

In conclusion, doubting yourself is not how you achive your success. Finding a way to solve it is achive your success. Get the insperation from the people who had once been in your spot and they done to successed to there goal. Even if failure is a role in life to find success it's the only way youll reach it. Failure is only a motivation to get you to successed.",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0

For my point of view, I think that is good to be positive, becaus if you are positive you have more chance to be successful in life, most of the times you can or can not regreat good things. Is good to be positive on the bad times, that way you do not feel worse. If you have a positive attitud, some people that have negative attitude is going to try to make you change, do not let that happend. be positive can make you a better person.

If you are going through bad times is always good to be and think positive, if you are a negative person you are going to see only the bad things of the good things, you can lose friends or you're family members, if you are a negative person, no body is going to like to be next to you.

negative people is going to try to make you change; some people can be selfish and if you always think positive and most of the times you regreat positive things, they are going to want to have what you have even though that you work hard for if.

When you work in a group you can finish faster. For example, if there is a group of three people, one people can be doing a job, while you are doing an other, and the third people can be doing an other. That is a smart and easy way to finish the work faster.

Working in the group can be very helpful for planing how to do a project. Like as, all the people in the group gives their opinion of how to do the project and everyone in the group hears the ideas and them, they vote for the best idea in the group. That is a key point of working in the group everyone express them self and the work become easily.

In a group you can have better ideas. For example, you are in a group, and you have an idea and you tell the idea to the group, all the people in the group is going to give an opinion, and they will tell you if your idea is good or it is bad. In that way you can have more ideas for you and your group, and your group and you can learn more from your ideas.

Working in a group can be more helpful, because you and all the people in the group can have more ideas and finish faster. Even thought some people prefer to work alone, because they think that they can be more concentrate and they can learn faster.

In conclusion in a group you can finish faster and have more ideas for you and your group. While working alone you can concentrate more because you have less talking, and you are less distracting,when you work alone you can learn more, because you find the answer at your own.

Although some say that inactivity serves a purpose because we can wait for the right moment to start an errand or chore, actually being active serves a purpose because we can increase our knowledge in; work,home and gaming and if we are studying a subject such as; Medicine, 3D Animated Cartoons and CyberSecurity we can master it ,and later on we can teach others.

Some say that inactivity serves a purpose because we can wait for the right moment to start an errand or chore. Once a read an article on Newsela that was about how a men waited to start his goal, and he ended up getting his goal very quick. The man was called Generic_Name. Generic_Name wanted to save up to buy a house. He started ti save up for two months, later on he won the lottery, Generic_Name was very happy about it, then he deposited all his money into his savings account. Time pass by and he realized he had enough money to buy his dreamed house. Generic_Name bought the house, and he lived happily ever after.

If we are inactive we can wait for the right moment to start and errand or chore. My Aunt(Generic_Name) wanted to do and errand but she decided to wait because she saw on CNN News that if we wait to do and errand or chore the succession rate increases by 25%. She did the errand and it went more smoothly than ever, he waited to do it and she succeeded on doing it.

Being inactive for a while it's good because if we decide to rush things the odds might be against us. My friend Generic_Name always like to rush things. One day he couldn't wait to buy a game that he went in the middle of the night to buy it. When he got to the store, the store was already closed. He walked form the game store to his house. He was very sad that he could not bought the game, later on he saw a women in white standing right in front of him. He woman in white turn down and he saw her.. the we ran like crazy. It's always better to wait to do something such as buying a game, don;t rush things or you will end up like Generic_Name.

F52394B3500C,"I think that school should not follow the business model. Adding two more hours to the schedule is not worth it for example some student need that time to other activities like go to the gym or play any sport and by adding two more hours that means that they are not going to be able to do all kinds of activities after they get out of school. There are some student whom work after they get out from school, they need that time to go work and make their money and having to stay on school two more hours means that are not going to have the same time as before to work also means that they are going to make less money. Staying on school two more hours will be a difficult task like myself I need go home after I am done with school because I have to take care of my house like make my sister food and clean my house I have to do that every day after I get out from 0school that is why it will be difficult task to do for me to stay two more hours on school.

I think that adding two more hours to the schedule and only having to go to school for four days only is not good idea sure we want to save energy as well but school can not afford to follow the businesses model. For example student can not afford to stay on school for 10 straight hours they are going be really tired and by being like that they might do their work wrong. Also those student whom work after school if they stay two more hours I think that they are going to be really tired for work I have some friends they start working at 5pm they get out of 3pm that means that they will have time to rest for two hours but if they have two stay on school for two more hours that means that they will get out of school at 5pm so they are not going to have time rest an just have to go straight to work. Another disadvantage of getting two more hours of school is that for those students whom works and get homework that means that they will not have time to do their homework for example myself I have to go home early to take care of my house I have to care of my house quickly so I can start doing my homework so staying two more hours on school for me it will be difficult to do all of that task after I get out from school.

Of course there are some benefits from adding two more hours to the school schedule like saving resources and saving energy also those student whom does not do anything after school can learn more because they can concentrate more they does no to worry about what they are going to do after school. There are some student whom does not do anything after they get out from school so for them it does not really matter whether they have o stay two more hours or they does not have to stay like my friend Generic_Name he is a student who does not do any actives or their go to work after school so for him it does not matter if have to stay two more hours. Having two more hours means that those student whom does not do anything after school can have more time con do their school work as well study more for their test. The benefit of adding two more hours only benefits those who does not do anything after school.

In conclusion trying to follow the businesses model is not good idea for our school, so many student are going to arguing for it they are going be saying that just by trying to save a little bit of energy and resources they have to change so many things and sacrifice their money and their time in fact is not a big different adding two more hours two the schedule every day because that means that we till have to use energy in those hours.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0
F53E50C57938,"Technically, students spend seven hours in school and seventeen hours at home regardless of what time they sleep or what they do when they get home. Students should have more time to study at home, rest and prepare for the next day. More hours in school will ware out the student causing it to effect their grades. I disagree with the school board's plan to extend the school day because students have extracurricular activities to do when they are not at school,and it disturb both the students and the teachers personal life.

Not all activities student perform happens in school. Adding an hour and a half to the school day can affect the student progress at home. For example, a student can be a player in a local soccer or basketball team, adding more hour will give the student less time to practice and get ready to the game or match and the student will also have little time to do his/her homework or complete an assignment or project given to them. The student having less time to practice is going to take a big tow on his/her team. Maybe the student is a very good player and his/her team needs him/her,he/she having small time to practice will make the team lose the match. This decision will not only effect the student but the teachers too.

Everyone wants to go home and relax from a long day work. The decision of adding ninety minutes to the school day is going to interrupt what the teacher and student do in their everyday life. Some teachers have families they have to take care of. They may have to pick their child or children from the babysitter, preschool or school if the don't use the bus. They also have doctor or dentist appointment they have to attend or have to take their children to. Teachers have chores or duties they must preform at home like shopping for groceries or picking little brother or sister from school. It could also be that they have another place to work at after school in order to earn more money. Both students and teacher have busy lives this decision is going to effect them.

There are many reasons why adding one hour and a half is bad but these are the ones I could come up with. I disagree with the school board's idea to extend the school day because students have extracurricular activities to do when they are not at school,and it disturb both the students and the teachers personal life. I think if the school board is going to add more time to the school they should high the pay of the teacher because it take time off their schedule.",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0
F54386A8122B,"Today i will be discuss if it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? most may disagree with this statement, but i will hopefully grab your attention and hope you could agree with me.

I think it is a good for students to decide on there career this early because number one in today's society everything is depended on technology. What are students into nowadays there phones, video game, IPads , computers, etc. So pretty high advanced technology is everywhere, My point that i'm trying to make here is that the majority of students get either there phones or computers at a young age. So in my opinion i think that there future is set way before high school. But again my point here is that yes i do agree that careers should be set when they enter high school.

With entering high school students are introduced to a lot of programs at the start of there new journey to life. theres programs in high school that take students to colleges and take them on tours or they either tell the what to major on in that specific college, With planning early for your future you save time for stressing out last minute. I feel like this shouldn't just be small societies making students plan really early this should be the whole nation because as students we are the future of the united states so why not start 4 or 5 years ahead. Although some people may say that this is a huge distraction only because students would want to just focus on the future instead of focusing on whats happening right now.

So the main argument is that I 100% agree with students choosing there careers at a young age. My main reason is that the early the better with chances of programs and guidelines to help you on your way to a better education theres no way that you can stress for a career. in addition to my statement I also think that schools should have a bunch of programs helping students out with there future that way they won't stress there last year of high school, and they won't have to apply to colleges not knowing what to do.

Well everyone has their own different type of way to accomplish something, but there is always some kind of inactivity at times; but not always. I think that we really do accomplish more when there is something else happening.

Everyone in this world is different compared to the next person. Everyone has their own unique style of completing an assignment. Some examples are Listening to music , working outside, working with someone else, and basically anywhere else. These small things can help somebody to Stay in task to complete something. Myself personally I love to be listening to music to get my assignments done. I am able to accomplish more than what I usually do. Before i never got my school work completed cause i was really bored of doing it, but when I first played music. I was flowing threw to get my work done.

Sometimes when trying to accomplish anything in life. Some people may experience some inactivity. Two things that happen the most to people are Zoning out or a phone notification. These two things are what happens to people the most, But they can always prevent it from happening. Me for myself i love using my phone. I never get bored of it. Sometimes while i'm working to get my assignments done and complete. There will always be a notification that will make my phone go ""Buzz buzz"" and then ill have the courage to see what it is. Now I have overcome that. What i do now is i put my phone on silent away from me while its connected to my Bluetooth speaker playing music. This always helps me from zoning out. Music playing in the background prevents me from zoning out.

some people can complete everything without a doubt, But not everyone could stay on task to complete something to accomplish it. We all had accomplish something in this world; but some people havent accomplish anything at all. Their minds are not set for reality I must say. Their minds are inactive and not set for anything. People can change. Anything can happen. Nothing in this world is really impossible, well if you set your mind to it. People dont believe in themselves to Accomplish anything. The inactivity that they got can change. Before i used to never get anything completed/Accomplish. I was thought I wasnt enough to do anything. I always made bad choices. My mind wasnt set for anything. I didnt care. I thought my life was a joke and soon it will be over as soon as I know it. School was hard. I didnt really get anything done. I was never the perfect student. My grades were bad. I had no faith in myself. I thought i could not do anything right. I never accomplished anything. The only thing I could accomplish is messing up everything. School, at home, In a public area, Anywhere.

I made bad choices back in my pass; But now its completed different. I have learn and seen everything that I did. My mind wasnt set on success only failure. Only I realized that I could change not just who i am but everything. If i set my mind into it. I started to accomplish assignments at school. I was doing very well then I thought i could do. I started to see a huge change in myself. It felt like i was a whole new person. I had accomplish to change my life. I saw the success. It wasnt hard. I just had to believe in myself to do it. If I could change then i know people in this world can change also.

Although accomplishing something no matter if its simple, Difficult, short, or long. Its still better off to accomplish it even tho there is always gonna be a little bit of inactivity, and its okay there are always a way to over come it. Everyone can always change. With the power of your mind and yourself you can always accomplish more if you are always doing something else with maybe a little of inactivity.",2.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0

So he decided to do some research on what kind of doctor he wanted to be before entering high school. Finally, Generic_Name decided he wanted to be, a surgeon. Took all of the classes he needed to be one. Few years later, became a surgeon, making lots of money, living in a nice house, and is living the best life he could dream of. In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Personally I think they should identify a career by the time they enter high school. So they can have the opportunities on what they need to do to get the job and not to be stressed out too much. Those are the reasons why they should commit to a career by the time they get to high school.

The first reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school is to have opportunities on what you need to get the job. In order to get the job, you need to go check out some places on what they do, so then you would know what to do. The other opportunity you have is you would know what classes you would need to take. For example, if you want to be a history teacher you basically just have to take most of the history classes, or if you want to be doctor you would basically take all sciene classes. The other opportunity is that if you want to make a lot of money have a plan set up. That's the reason why you should identify a career by the time you enter high school to have opportunities on what you need to get the job.

The second reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school is, so they don't get stressed out too much. If you know what you want to do then you're fine because the more you know the less stress you'll be in. If you know what you want to do then you'll be able to know what classes you will need to take, so then you won't have to take extra classes for no reason. Also if you need help don't hesitate to ask because everyone is here to help. The more you ask for help the less you'll be stressed. That's the reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school, so they don't get stressed out too much.

Some people would disagree with me because they think it's ok to wait to identify a career before they enter high school. They say that because they think high school is a place where you just hang out with friends, and not care about their grades when they should. Also, they think their interest in what they want to do will pop up eventually probably like in their senior year. No, that would be hard to figure out what college you would need to go to, don't even have a plan, and would just be stressed out.

In conclusion, in society they think that they should have an idea on a career by the time they enter high school. I strongly agree with that and there are many reasons why. So they can have opportunities on what you need to get the job, and that is know what classes you would need to take. Also, so they don't get too stressed out for it.

If you know what you want to do then you're fine because the more you know the less stress you'll be in. Those are the reasons why i agree with this statement.             ",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0

Some people think curfew should be adopted for teenagers and other think it should not be adopted for teenagers. Curfew keeps teenager out of trouble after midnight on weekends and after 10 pm on weekdays. It will keep them safe, healthy, and smart.

The curfew will keep teenagers safe. Most of teenagers like to party at midnight. Some of them like to have alcohol at party. It is illegal to have alcohol under age of 21. There are many issues that will concern their safety. Someone can bully them and also most crimes happens at night time. One day I asked my mom to go at party with my friends at night. She did not allowed me to go at party, at that time I was badly mad at her. In the morning, I heard that my some of friends got caught by police because they were having alcohol. At this point of time I thought my mom was mean but after hearing a story, I thanks to my mom for not allowing me to go at party. I was safe at home while others girls were in trouble. The lesson that I got from this story is that never break rules and it is better to stay home at night because of safety issues.

Curfew will keep teenagers healthy. A normal person should have sleep of maximum eight hours. When teenagers go out at weekdays it really effect their health because they have to go to school in the morning. If you are not healthy it will effect your studies. A person health should be a first priority. Most teenagers are not mature enough curfew will keep them healthy. There was a day when I was out with my friends on shopping. We went to mall together. I went back at home at 12:30 pm, than in morning I went to school. I did the same routine for a week. After that I started getting sick. It effected my brain. I went to doctor they said it happened because of lack of sleep. After that I try to sleep at 9:30 everyday, now I am feeling much healthier and stronger. The more you will get good sleep the better your health will be.

Curfew will keep teenagers smart. Most of teenagers like to study at night unless they get distracted by extra stuff. Teenagers go school in the morning some of them do extracurricular activities. They are busy in the day, so they like to have fun at night. They don't do their homework because they go out at night. It effects their studies really bad. If teenagers stay at home at nights they can complete their homework and get a good night sleep. In tenth grade, I used to play basket ball everyday after school. I never had time to spend quality time with my friends. I started going out at night and also, skipping my homework. After a week, I checked my grades I had ""D"" in my three classes. My mom also got a call from school that I am not doing good in my classes. My mom got really upset on me. She stopped me going out at night. I started working on my homework. Now I have very good grades in class. The curfew will help a lot of teenagers with their studies. It will keep them smart and intelligent.

There should be a curfew for teenagers after 10 pm on weekdays and midnight curfew on weekends. Curfew will stop them because if they go out at night they will be breaking the rules. If teenagers follow the rule they will be protected, strong and intelligent. So, safety is the first priority. Everyone should follow rules because it will be best for them.                                                                                          ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
F673BCEC3BD1,"People who value self-reliance define dependence. Following your own instincts and making your own decisions is the whole point of life in my opinion. It makes a person more independent and trustworthy. Also, helps a person learn from own mistakes.

A person will always have guidance. Whether its from parents, teachers, police officers, or even a person you dont even know can give you some type of guidance. It always goes back on how the individual is going to view it. Independence is very important. Having full control and capability of standing alone can make a person realize what is best for them. Also, not being easily influenced can help a lot. Understanding what is best for you can make your decisions much easier.

People need to learn from their own mistakes. Mistakes happen every day. A persons instincts may not always be right but it will benefit them in the future. Another person is not going to tell you something you want to hear or give you the assurance you need for something. They may think they know whats best for you but personally for you, it could not be the best. Knowing yourself and knowing how you like things to be done is another example of self-reliance.

Seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be the right thing to do. It can save a person from debating too much on a decision. Help a person plan better for the future and not really let the person struggle. As well, as to prevent the individual to stress out of what not knowing to do. However, a persons own instincts and ideas is what makes the person value self-reliance. And know whats best for them. Who knows you better than you?

People can deside is they want to know the person better. People can change in there own way, or if they really want to change they need to deside to be better in life. The first impression is impossible to change. They need time,effort, and dedication to change. Most people can said that you do not need all those things to cange. The people at the fist impression. The first impression is what the person make you feel.

The first impression is what the person show you. The person can not change at the first impression, they most need to have the specific time to change. One of the most important fact to change is time. For example, is a person is fighting with a employee at the Ice cream story, you can not can change that person that way the he think. Maybe you must wants that. He need to realise what he is doing is something wrong .The person most have his reason for the fight. The person need time to change not at the firt moment the you meet. Most people can determine that they need time to cange. Another example of that is someone have a really bad adiction to do someting that do not have none benefict for his life. You most want to change that person. The first impression that this person make in you most be the most terrible impression. First impression is impossible to change.

First impression is actually what the person make in you. Sometimes is not the best impression that the person make .Sometimes you must want to change that at the same moment even is you do not know the person. The person can change with effort is you talk to the person and let her know that what is doing is not right. Maybe the person can change but not at the first impression that need take time. For example is a student is copy in a test and you realize what the student is doing you must want to change the way the he is thinking. The student need to have effort and act of actitude that he can do anything in life and have the effort to do it .Another example of that is you meet someone for the first ime in the attitude is so bad you most want to tell the people to change. The person need to have the effort to change is the person wants that. The first impression are almost imposible to change. First impression is what the person show you. Some people are more complicate they do not want to any effort to change. The first impression is the way the you most guess the personality of the person.

First impression is what the person show you. A good first impression is what the person guess of on you. First impression is what the person wakes you feel. You most not espect the negatives accion of the person, because you do not really know that .The specific time you most know that person is it something that you do not like of the person with dedication can change. For example is you meet someone at the park for the firts time and you and the person start talking. Most one of the two person want to change something in you or oppsite. The people can not change at the first time they need time and dedication. The first impression is more important when you meet someone for first time. For example is a father leave at him son when he was a baby , and when they meet for first time the father have to have the best impression for his son. The son wants to espect how his father is he most want to know that. The first impression is the most important for that father. That father have to change is he have something that his son do not like. He need to have dedication to achieve that. The first impression the more imprtant when you meet someone for the first time.

The people can not change at the first time. Many people think that we can not change a person with the first impression. A person need there own respected goal to change.

Nevertheless not everybody agree this opinion, some people disagree because sometime people with not have mastered make better the job than the people with mastered.

First, when you have a mastered your work better on this sometime to do, because this people have years to study and practice. For example in restaurant wen you have a mastered on chef you only need to memorize the recipes, other people need to memorize the condiment's, the tools, and the machines is used.

Second, with the mastered you get better opportunities, because you have a title show you already prepared for the job. For example some companies need you have a mastered for the job or the position, is like a some restaurants if you want to work like manager you need a mastered and you get more money.

Third. you get better position than the people no have the mastered, because you show your experience. For example if on restaurant need people for kitchen, manager and dish washer with mastered you get the position of manager and the people with not have mastered is more probably put in dish washer and if he want to work with manager need more time and work more hard.

In this essay I will discuss as to why curfews could be a necessary law for teenagers.

One of the reasons curfews could help out parents keep their children safe is that teenagers like to hangout with friends late at night and having a curfew for teenagers could prevent them from getting in some sort of trouble.

Another reason why curfews could keep teenagers more safe is teenagers think they know everything in this world but in reality they don't know how the world really is and anything can happen at any certain time.

The finale reason why I think some teenagers need to have curfews is because some teenagers are still not mature enough to be out late at night and something could possibly happen to them. I think the 3 reasons listed above is more than enough evidence to have curfews for teenagers to keep them safe and to keep parents aware and calm for their children. As a parent or guardian of a teenager we all want to keep our children as safe as possible because anything could happen outside our homes.

However,when I started to put that hard work in I started to get good at drawing and then i saw that I can only get better by working hard. Moreover,working hard is a chance for me to show my self what im capable of doing. Working hard is good for me because im challenging my self to do better in life as I get older and get better in my skills and talents. As can be seen,just by working hard can take someone far in life to achieve greatness.

Secondly,everyone has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that talent or skill is by practicing it. For example, my friends talent is playing soccer. My friend is really good at soccer because he practices and trains everyday. Even though my friend is small and skinny he doesnt care who he plays against because he can play with people twice his size and double his weight and still play good. For example,one day I went to see my friend play in a tournament. The day of the tournament was beautiful because the sun was out,the sky was blue, and the temperature was perfect. After a few minutes of us waiting, the game finally started and we got to see my friend play. At the beginning of the match my friend was going through everyone because of how he was playing. My friend was running so fast that he looked like a cheetah running for the ball. After the match was over they ended up winning the whole tournament because they had the most points which made my friend really happy cause all that hard work had finally paid off. Later we went to eat at a restaurant which smelled like flowers and the food tasted like if it was from heaven. As can be seen,practicing can take people to achieve greatness.

Lastly,everyone has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that talent or skill is by constantly doing it. For example,when my dad started to learn how to play the guitar. At first my dad was really bad because he had never played a guitar in his whole life,so he told his friend to teach him hot to play it. My dads friend told him everything he needed to know on how to play it,so my dad started playing the same notes constantly until he learn how to play it. Further more,having a talent is awesome because it can help people with daily day challenges. For example,if im playing a soccer match and my talent is playing soccer im going to do good,or if im in school and i have to do a project and my talent is drawing im going to get a good score because thats where im good at. As can be seen,practicing constantly can improve someones talents or skills.

In conclusion,everyone has a talent or skill they just need to know how to develop that talent or skill. By practicing,working hard,and constantly doing it can be improve a persons talent or skill. Do you think its helpful to have a talent or skill?",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

F90A6181BBCA,"In this world many of us make decisions by ourselves and others seek guidance to make decisions in their life. While some people argue that people should seek guidance to make decisions in their life, but I think it is more beneficial if people make their own decisions because if people make their own decisions they will develop their self confidence and they will become responsible person. Also, if people make their own decisions they will have happier life in the the future.

It's true that by making our own decisions that we will develop our self confidence and become responsible person. If person make decision that decision might be hard, after making the decision the person will develop his or hers self confidence and they will become responsible for the decision that they made. For example, if one person decides to leave his parents house to live by his own, he will be responsible for himself because he decided not to live with his parents no more. This will help him to be responsible person because he has to take care of himself by his own. Another example can be, In school, Students choose their classes for next year by themselves. This will help them to develop their self confidence because they are deciding what is better for them or not by their own. Also, this will help them to decide and have a confidence in what they will major in the future. So, by making our own decisions we can develop our self confidence and become responsible person.

Secondly, It's also true that by making our own decisions we will be happy and have happier life. When people make important decisions by themselves and if they achieve their goal by making this decision they will become happy and they can have happier life. For instance, if one student decided not to go college, instead he wanted to become a soccer player. If the student worked hard and become a professional soccer player he will be happy and will have happier life because he decided to become a professional soccer player by himself instead of going college. Additionally, In school, When I was sophomore, I was choosing classes for next year and I decided to take classes that I thought that are important for me and that can help me for college. Then when I take the classes this year I was very happy of my decision because this classes helped me a lot. So, people should make their own decision because they will be happy and have happier life by the decision they made.

On the other hand, some people argue that people should seek guidance to make decisions in their life because it helps them not to make wrong decisions, but I think that is wrong because if you always seek guidance to make decision in your life the decision that you made may not satisfy you in your future life. For example, if your parents advice you to make decision to become a doctor and if you made a decision to be a doctor by listening your parents ,in the future you might have bad life because being a doctor might not be part of your life. Also, you will experience difficulties in your life because your decision is influenced by others. So, people should make their own decision because it helps them to become better self confident person. By making our own decision we can gain a lot in our life.

Finally, people should make their own decision because it will help them to develop their self confidence and to become a better person by being responsible. Also, by making their own decision they will have a better life in the future. People should make their own decision to become better person by achieving their goals. Additionally, peoples have to make a decision by themselves because they can gain a lot in their life.                ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0
F98FEC21D9EA,"Should School Extend Two More Hours To The Normal Schedule?

One topic that is frequently debated is whether school should extend the day schedule or keep a normal schedule as they have it already. Some people think that school should not expend two more hours to our normal schedule. They feel that if we spend two more hours at school, it will be boring and tired. In my opinion, school should extend two more hours to our schedule for many reasons: I can spend more time to learn in classes, spend more time with friends, and work one more day during the week.

Once, I was pretty nervous about my Earth Science SOL test, I did not know what to do to pass it because I never passed any quiz or test that we did during the school year, and I felt worried because I did not understand some topics, and I only had one week to learn everything, so I decided to stay everyday after school to practice with my teacher and by myself at home, after a couple days of practicing I realized that I had learned what I needed to learn and I felt ready to take my SOL and finally, I passed it. Now I know that spending more time in classes helps us to understand what we do not understand yet, learn more about the topics that we are practicing in class, and get ready for any test that we have during the semester.

Sadly, I am a Senior, and this is my last year in High School, and that means that maybe, I will not see some friends and teachers again, so I am trying to enjoy everyday in the school expending time with friends and teachers whether during lunch or during classes, and I think that spending at least 25 more minutes with them in every class will help us to know more about each other, and to make more experiences to remember after we graduate from High School.

As some students, I do not have a permanent job or an everyday job as some people call it, I work for a moving and storage company, and that means that I can only work Saturdays and sometimes Sundays because I come to school and they ask me to be ready in the company at 7:00 am when I am going to work, but having a free day school during the week would benefit me because I would be able to work one more day during the week, and earn extra money to buy something that I might need.

As you have read, I am agree about extend the school day two more hours. Only when we realize that spending more time at school would helps us to learn easier, make a lot of experiences with friends and teachers, and gives us a free day school to work, to do homework, to spend time with family, or do some chores at home, the world will be a better place with students that understand what they need to understand about their classes, and people who takes advantage of at least one day free per week.",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5

Point the errors keep student away to avoid do it next time, for example if a junior student is about to take the SAT exam ; he decide to practice math problems .His math teacher decide to check his work, and he think praise his work is good because make him feel less worried about the exam, but the truth is making feel better is not helpful because he is not gonna get enough knowledge about his problems. I could say he is going to feel much better with a high score in his exam.

Lower the possibility to gain knowledge because the student in some point would have to use their knowledge it could be in college, at their job, and home. Like in my sophomore year I had a English teacher who praise most of my work because she thought that would in increase my knowledge, but was the opposite I felt like I was going backward instead of forward. I found praising a student work make them learn less in the way if they have something wrong students would have to look for answer, so that mean if they find what they did wrong is a chance of increase their knowledge because they might find more than just the answer that they are looking for.

Student learn for their mistakes it's much better point those mistakes out than hide it form them. Eventually student that don't show improvement are the ones that the teacher decide hide their errors because it's better clear the doubt. Like a kindergarten student they asked a lot of question to the teacher, and most of the time the teacher correct their work to let them know what did they do wrong to improve their work. It would not make sense that the teacher tell to the all student that they know all the alphabet just to make them feel better, so the students could stop learning and focus in other activities like math, social studies, or even play. Praising is not good as we thought because can make us be okay with our work, and not encourage us to learn.

while some may say praise student work could keep the working to make them improve and build self-esteem, actually student learn form their mistakes, and it's better point it out than hide it from them because an error doesn't mean failure meant the student is improving to success. with the success comes the self-esteem.",2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.5

If you want a job and you only sit on your couch how will you get a job? The anwser to that question is you wont because you are not going out and applying for a job. You have to be active and you have to always keep looking until you have the job you want. Nobody will come to you and tell you

Their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. They want to make sure you have the classes you need in order to acheive your career . The career that you will be giving to the counsouler will be befetional. After the graduation you will easily take the classes that you wanted.

firstly, I think it is good idea to identify your career before entering to high school.

If you plan your career from a young age, you will achieve your career very strong and easily. In order to have a successful life you need a good career.

secondly,Try to talk with someone who have experiences in this types of problems. When you talk to someone they will be giving you some advises to help you during your high school time. For example: When you want to take the classes you need to take , or you have to take, but they give you useless classes you do not need for graduation. If you want to go to a law school, then you need to take social study ,or government but when you do not commit your plan of career they will give some useless classes like Photography, Independent living and Art which you do not need for law school.

Thirdly,It is very important to have a good education in this day and age. You do not need to waste time of your life in classes you do not need. We have to try our best to be organized. You have to think about your future ,and consciousness that will be coming to you. There is multiple ways to began your career, solve problems , and finally acheive your career.

Students may bring there phones to school but they could only use them while there in lunch or any free time. Phones need to be turned off while in class or in the library if not they might get there phone taken away and they need to pick it up at the end of the day. Student's phones must be in their backpacks or in their pockets during class.

On, this policy by having phones at school the students should just leave their phones at home so it wont be taken by the teacher or so you wont loose it at school or other students wont have to rob you. So that's why students should really leave there phones at home. Another thing why students should not bring their phones to school at all it might fall and brake when you walk or if your texting you might bump into each other

I believe that students really need to leave there phones at home because someone might call in the middle of class. or a friend might text you in the middle of class also so students leave your cell phones at home..",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0

Most people that graduate early goes through depression because they are loosing a huge part of their child hood.

from my point of view people who graduate find a huge difficult in life because when they graduate,they will have that mind set it is good idea to take a year of college because they graduated early and when you rest for a year you start to forget everything you learn and when you go to t college you have less memory on what u learn in high school.

For a student to graduate early they most have a lots of requirement to graduate such a good record responsible and have a plan in life.

One reason is that if you fail, that is going to make stronger for the next time. It's like a game; you are going to do whaterver it takes to gain the game. If you do not do it in the first round, it's going to be the second and you'll do even better. A lots of people think that if they don't do it in the first time, that's going to be it. They don't realize that if they just keep going they're going to get there, and be success. Wouldn't it be great if we didn't have to fail? but that's how it's some times. We have to accept it and keep trying. Life is fool of problems, but we just have hang in there and keep trying and get where we want.

Another reason is that never loss of enthusiasm, that's the most important reason of all of this. if we don't have that exclusive word is like life does not make sense at all. For example, I used to have this friend that his mom wanted him to be a doctor, but he didn't want to be a doctor. He wanted to be a teacher. Farthermore, he study to be a doctor. He wasn't that good but that was what his mom wanted. The second year, which was even harder he just stop. He talked to his mom saying that was not for him. He did not have any enthusiasm on that career, so he fanilly started classes to become a teacher. now, that was for him. He did so much better, good grades and excellents jobs.

Life is fair,whether you are poor or unhealthy,It always take care of hardworking one. On the other hand,what can we do if we determine to be idle? That will be extremely boring.

FBE180CF324E,"To begin, what are your thoughts on first impressions through peoples point of view? When two people interact with one another the impression is not always dependable because People are probably not themselves, People opinion change, People never have the same intellectual connection. For example Generic_Name went to the movies with his girlfriend Generic_Name, his mom Generic_Name, and his sister Generic_Name. Generic_Name tells Generic_Name to invite her boyfriend Generic_Name. Generic_Name interaction with Generic_Name was unpleasant, based on what Generic_Name saw their was a different perspective from one an other. Days later at night the family reunites and the perspective change from what Generic_Name thought at first and what she thinks now.

Secondly, periodically all around the world people are not themselves when we first interact with them. Their is always a fifty- fifty chance that people, will get to meet their real personality. Why? First because they are starting to get to know new people. Second they have no idea what to expect from people. Third, some people do above and beyond to impress. Now in days many people try to make a good impression to belong to a certain group. Sometimes they are so use to doing it that they dont even recognize that is not their true self. Society has a huge impact on how people have to impress one another that it make others be afraid to show who we truly are.

However, peoples opinion change from time to time. Visualize that we are going to the store just to buy one item. We end up buying more then one item what does that mean ? It means that are mind changes to what we want it to change to. We might set up a scenario in are minds to have very high expectations to those surrounding us ,when we are self don't have that confidence. For example Generic_Name was mad at Generic_Name for not going to the bank with her. So Generic_Namea said that they would no longer be friends. The next day she text her and said what time am I picking you up. Their was a change of opinion from night to morning.

Lastly, people never have the same intellectual connection. When you first meet someone and we are aware we want to make a connection ,we try to have some conversation to talk about. For example when people have a right there connection is because they are interested and the same things as one another. When two people dont have the same to things to talk about other might think this person is not interesting enough. People would make comments like no , your not qualify to join this group, or anything that involves having to impress another person.

In conclusion, first impression arent usually trustworthy because People are not themselves, People opinion change, and People never have the same Intellectual connection. Peoples thoughts will change eventually no mater if they had a good impression at first. First impressions never counts because we never know who might be fooling us for a job , friendship, or to be a partner. Society now in days have to look out more to make sure everythig is in order. Thats why we have people who do research and look back to records, thats why jobs and people have a process of doing things.                                      ",4.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0

I agree with Philosopher, physicain, and humanitarian Albert Schweitzer saying that ""Is setting a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people."" For instance, most people look up to others to better them self by using thier action or behavior.

First and Foremost, you having a better behavior help others reflect on you to better their self. Mostly, student or collegues look up to pass student who had accomplished something good and make them determined so they can also achieve something by taking hard classes to pass. Due to the pass student behavior on thier education who set an impact on others telling them they can do it. Is kind of having them as their motivator. I look up to people behavior and tell myself i can be more than that person due to his behavior. Most of them, encourage me to be who i want to be and to achieve my goal.

Secondly, it leads them in the right path and it depends on thier action. Your action towards your behavior matters, It depends on how you act towards a good behavior. If your action are good towards a good behavior it leads to the right path. Emmulating someones behavior or action can help you be in the right path. Most of the times we look up to people who have or had been who we want to be and then pick thier footsteeps by learning from their good behavior. For example, looking at Lebron James, famous basketball player, looking at his games played can help you to be motivated and lead you to the right path of your goal. Looking up to a famous person and following his footsteps emmulating his behavior set a good example to others.

In Conclusion, setting a good behavior or example kind of influence people so they can be on the right path and kind of know to set up a good behavior for someone else to follow. I take the stand and agree with Phiosopher saying ''Is setting a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people.""",3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5

Because they end up taking the wrong decision and I do understand that as student you just think to finish school and graduate to became profesional. The idea of finish high school in tree years instead four,

it will force students to chose the wrong career because they will not have enough time to get ready for college and they are still immature at that age.

First of all, students who are trying to finish their high school in tree years instead four they don't have enough time to prepare for college. They will not have build their knowledge to be succefull in callege. High School is means to prepare and help students to get ready for college, but spending less time in the school they would not have enough time to learn or cover all the subject in clase. In addition, they will not develop their skills and be succefull in college or their future. Some people might think the is a good a idea to finish high school in tree years because they can enter in college early and start to work but they might not be ready for college.

Forthermore, students at that ege still immature that they don't really know what they want to do with their life or if they want to go college. In addition, some kids might be even think drop off school and don't comtinue in college because school require time, persevere, dedication and concentration which a lot of the students don't have when they are immature.

For this reason, they need to spent four years in school instead tree so they can learn to be responsible. Some parents and studenst migh think that it not necesary spent four years at schoo when they can finish in tree but if they are immature and inresponsible they are not going to be succefull in their future.

Finally, students who want to finish their school in tree years instead four, they don't know what career to chose or if they want to continue in college.

People don't care about others feelings, I do in some way everyone matters. People you never talk to look at you in a weird or mean way, Others dont even get along. But they don't know who you really are with out getting to know you like they say dont judge a book by its cover and i agree. My mom things that i go to school to look nice and its not true part of it is but i also try hard to get good grades,its not easy.

FE4E3BB2DAE1,"People really work on this this? or People knows the importance to be better every day? People didn't know the importance to learn more, like give to their mind more wisdom and they just conform with small pieces and

I very agree with this statement because it's true that if you dont learn more than you already know, you don't be able to be successful in life and I was wrong all the time and it's sad for me just realize that I waste a lot of time doing nothing and this question makes think a lot and the reason why is because I never think about to do something much better that I did already and sometimes if I have to do it, Im afraid to fail or do something wrong but small things do the difference and know something more that you already do it gives you more opportunities in life and you grow more.

Try something new that you never done before it's something scary for humans it doesn't matter the age or how brave you are,

if you had a lot difficulties doing it; probably you will be scare if you have to do it again even if you already know how to do it for example, I been working in a Japanese restaurant about one year and half and it was the first time for me working as a server and I was scare to do it and the reason why I decide to do it was the money, and I got surprise of myself because I made it and my boss was telling me that I was doing really good job and I felt so proud of my self because at that time my English wan't perfect and after I'm got problems with him about money and it was too much problems, so I decide get another job my friend told me that her boss was looking for new servers so I went to apply but the problem was when I saw the size of the restaurant and the different with the other restaurant was a lot and also when I saw the menu in mind I was saying "" You will fail""

I feel too bad that day, and all the progress was long and suffering for all the mistakes that I made but I made it one more time and today I thinking all that I went through it was't that much difficult and I'm not a master but I'm still learning.

Many people are conformist with their life and dont want to learn more and unfortunelly I'm include in that group of people and it happens to me that I fail many times because

I think already know everything even more than others for example, One day I was taking a Spanish test and felt confident about it because my first language is Spanish and I remember the majority of my classmates were studying for that test but wasn't and I fail the test because I saw questions that I never imagine that even exist and that was very important to get a credit so that day I learn that even if know many things is always good learn more.

In conclusion, you have to be better every day and know that is always more to learn every day, even if you know the stuff and always keep in your mind that try something new don't have to scare you because every human has the ability to learn and do the much that they want and the only obstacle you put it to your self.

FE60E597467E,"What is positive attitude? Positive attitude is when a person has positive thoughts about something that went wrong or good, but they see all the possibles ways to success in life. Having a positive attitude is essential in lifestyle, this can bring happiness to your life, and can take you to extraordinary places. I think having a positive attitude is important because this is a way to express yourself around others, and to show the way you can manage your thoughts. I agree that having positive attitude is the key to success in life, and that everyone should have a positive attitude not just for a work area but anywhere.

There are many reasons to have a positive attitude, for example: you may want to have a positive attitude when you get a bad grade on the test, because you can think positive and say: "" I did bad on this test today but, I am going to keep trying and studying hard every time so I can do better"".

Another example is when you are doing a sport and you think you can't do it and that you are going to give up, you can tell yourself you can do it and have a positive attitude towards it. There are always problems in the daily life, and people deal with this problems not always with a good attitude.

What will happen if you don't have a positive attitude? Well if you don't have a positive attitude, you won't have success in life because you are going to have negativity in your mind and the word ""fail"" is going to become one of your favorites. Having a positive attitude is not always easy, and not all people have it. A negative attitude is the opposite of a positive attitude, and this can affect your life. For example: In school if you have a bad attitude things can go bad, when you are always being negative usually your problems don't get fix and you struggle more with your thoughts. This can mentally affect you, and teenagers are challenged every day by this issue.

The key is positively to a succesful life. I personally consider myself as a postive person. I try to solve every problem with a positive attitude because when I do so, my problems get fix the good way and I am happy with the results. If I don't have a postive attitude, all my goals would be nothing, I get stress and change my attitude, and I even hurt people's feelings without knowing. Success is important too because by this you can be a better person for society, people can judge you differently and you can help others when they are going through a lot. Positively is also mental strength,

it expands your knowledge, it changes the way you think about everything, and makes your life easier.

In conclusion, having positive attitude helps you to have success in life. Sometimes it's hard to understand how people can be so positive about everything, but not all people are happy in their lifes. Some people have their reasons to not be positive, and it's important to understand these people. Other people, like me, have postitive attitude towards anything, which is good because it helps you in your daily life, work, school and others activities. A lot of people like other people with a positive attitude, because it brings positive energy and hapiness to other people's life. Everyone should have a positive attitude, if you are not a positive person, it's not to late to change the way you are living , and it's time to have more positive thoughts and say "" positive"" for a successful life.

When you are in a young age is difficult to choose what you really want it takes time to choose what you want or to choose a career at a young age because they don't have a lot of responsibility's at a young age a lot of them just think of having a playful and safer childhood.

I do not agree with the schools that offer distance learning, because it could be difficult for students to understand the online notes or videos, the students always need a teacher to ask questions, and the student's parents need to pay internet at home. Also the internet is expensive and some parents can not afford.

First, it can be beneficial for the students to attend at school because there is more activities and sports, where they can have fun with their friends.

Also, the teachers are always there to help and explain better the subjects. From my own experience, I need to be with a teacher to understand what is the topic about, that helps me to pass my exams and my classes. Even thought, there is some teachers that are very strict and irritate the students but the teachers know that is beneficial for the students future.

Therefore, being at home the whole time it is so boring because the students need to be studding and not having fun. That is why some students cannot develop them knowledge because they do not take fresh air and entertain them minds with someone else. For example, my friend Generic_Name she is at the Community College and the teachers offer some online classes and she decided to take it. But now she is frustrating because she have to watch some boring videos and she have to take quizzes constantly. She told me that she miss all her friends and her classmates.

After all, certain student do not have their mind clear enough attending to school; now imagine how difficult would be for them to take online classes without a teacher.

Then, he came back to school, he was so disappointed because he mist a lot of stuff from his subject. He had to stayed after school and he had to go to summer school. Well, so far I have not take online classes but I take my friends experiences that is not easy.

Finally, in my opinion is not a great idea that the students take online classes, if they want to move faster and achieve in the future.
