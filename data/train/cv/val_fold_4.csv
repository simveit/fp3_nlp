If u change the school policy of having a grade b average that unfair. Because many students have a C average. So that means that they cant go out for sports or other activities they want to do bad. That's like taking everything they have. What if kids want to become good at something, but now they cant because of that school policy. If they have a C average they should still be able to go out for sports or activities. A C average isn't that bad, its higher then a D average. If the school police was if you have a D average of lower they shouldn't do sports or activities. If they have a D average in school for not working hard, that's means that they in ain't going to try hard. If they have a C average and there trying hard they should be able to out for sports or activities. What if all the good people in sports have a C average in school, that means that they cant play and were going to lose every game we have. That's a good policy to get grade's up but don't take away something they care about. Everyone should be able to go out for sports if they want to. If the school policy happens, schools going to be boarding now, because now students cant go out for sports or other activities. The students that are doing good in school should feel good about themselves but we shouldn't take the other students away from the others ones. If we do this policy student will try to raised their grade but if they cant what happens they them. Should they just be out of it and think that schools boarding. If they do this its like taking away their video games. All I'm saying is that they have the right to go out for sports or activities.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5

The negativity that others brings shouldn't affect people even thought they might get hurt; what you should care the most is to be in peace with yourselves.

Success is important for everyone, people should make smart choices and learn from others to become professionals themselves in the future. You need to focus on yourselves first and be smart but at the same time treat others with kindness and respect to gain respect from them either. Sometimes life its going to get hard but it will be worth it hard work always pay off with good results although success doesn't seem easy.

Do you think imagination is more important then knowledge? I agree with Albert Einstein because if people focus on getting more knowledge people won't be trying to solve the problem with imagination. When more people come in to the USA then people or trying to stop it and not focusing on the students and staff that want help when in need. When people do their taxes the money goes to helping solve the problem so people should do their taxes to help solve the problem faster so kids can have go learning environment. The more the President wants to work on trying to get a imagination law to be made he should be focusing on the over things he ran for president not just one thing for years. The President should work on helping the people in need like sick people or the homeless and trying to help the homeless buy or get a small home to be safe in in so they can survive in the cold days and be clean and healthy. I mean having knowledge is good to get the job you wanted since you were a kid but i say it's better to work on imagination while working on helping people in need. I'm just saying that the President should work on lots of things and when working on big problem too. What do you think of when people say is imagination more impotent then knowledge?

03CB73341E0E,"Do you think its a good idea to have somone make your decisions for you all the time? There is somthing you should know about having a person make decisions for you, and making decisions for yourself. I think making your own decision is the best way to solve life important problems, and I will tell you why I think so.

Making your own decisions is a sign of taking your life to the next level in many ways. Ways such as maturity, self confidence, determination, and intelligence. The reason why taking others advice all the time isnt good is because there is going to be a time where no one will be there for you when you make that life changing decision or in a situation where you have to make the decision right away. When you learn to follow your own instincts and learn to make your own decisions is the moment you can show others that you are a responsible for your actions, That you are a fully matured adult. At the end of the days its all about whats best for you and the people around, the people who depend on you.

Having somone make your decisions for you is a sign that you are not ready for the real world. Like I said before, you will get to that specific point in your life when you are just going to have to make this important decision. Thats why its always important to learn to follow on what you think is right. Your dependents when you were a kid, always taught and told you what the best thing to do is. So when you get old enough to make decisions on your own, you know whats best for you. The times you should be taking advice from others is when you're a learning child. A child learning off examples from your parents or dependebles. The times when you should be making decisions for yourself is the times when you have learnt off these examples as a child from your dependents, now to grow up as an adult and do whats best for you. And the cycle continues. I think its more understandable when you put it that way.

In conclusion, self decision making shows you are a responsible adult in many ways. And most importanly shows you are ready for obsticles that will come in your way in the real life. depending on others just shows you still need people to make these decisions for you even though there will certainly be a time when there will be no one but you. And this will really hurt you if you dont start to take responsibility for yourself and your dependents. So yes, I think people should make there own decisions.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0
03F7CF142B70,"many people say that True self-esstem does come from achievement so you can learn faster and have advanced learning.

True self esstem comes from achievement because you can learn faster and have advanced learning in all your classes.

First, some people say that self- esstem can make you learn faster because when you work as a class and also when you work by yourself with some help from teachers yo are building up your self-esstem mostly by working alone. Self-esstem can help you at school at home and in the community too. Self-esstem can help you get good grades in school and also get a promotion by your boss at work for working hard and doing everything on time and right the first time. Self-esstem is the best thing you can have at school when you are in classes that are hard for you .

Secondly, true self-esstem can get you in advanced classes so you can have advanced learning in all classes. Self-esstem can help you graduate and get in to a good collage and have a job that you love so much since you were in high school. Sometimes you need to have patience with self-esstem so you can make strong and sturdy and not weak and wobbly.

Some may argue that Self-esstem comes from praising a student's work to build self-esstem because it all depends on how the student's work on worksheets and also on homework and how they ask for help. However, praising a student's work can probably help the students build self-esstem.

Unquestionly, self-esstem can come from achivement not from praising because it can help you learn faster and also have advanced learining in all classes. You will have a great chater with a strong self-esstem. ",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

People has different passion for example they are people that want to learn about sing,dance,write,read,technology and more in depends in what would you like to learn .High school were made to learn about important things about Science,Math, History,English and some of them are fun. However there are some high school's that requires to have a class of drama,or art before you graduate at least you have to have one class it can be drama or art. I believe schools should have more options to students for example music,dance, sports, sing ,cook ,technology,cars,and more because no everyone is interest in drama or art. It should be elective by the students, first reason why it should be elective is because the people have different passion and dreams,second reason is that might be helpful to identified who you are,and it would help you to success.

One of my passion is to make new tings that no one has never ever create something that can be helpful to heal people life. Thats my passion and my dream .The last school that I went they require two elective classes but is optional the students have the right to choose. My counselor help me to find out some elective classes about science and humans it was really hard to find the right class for me. Somehow they were some students in the same classroom and they were boring,sleeping. The reason why they were like that is because thats not them passion they probably want to be learning about something different. Thats why is important to be in a class where you really feel that you going to learn. So that can happen to many students that's why is really important to know what are your passions and to be free to choose at least one elective class.

Two years afters I finish the elective class my brain was confused everything change because before taking those classes it was hard for me to choose my career. So right now am pretty sure how and who I want to be in a future that class help me to find out that heal sick people is my passion specially children's health. Before the elective class my dream was to be a police officer and now my maid is completely change and it was and still being help full to me. Now the electives class are helping me to applied in universities and scholarships .Basically these can happen to more students, there some students who don't know who they are and what they want to be in the future and these electives class can help them at the same way that helps me. However principals should know that is important to help students to find out what passion and accomplish they what to made while they are in high school.

In conclusion high school's should let students to choose at least one elective class every year. Elective classes has they own benefit to students. In my opinion I am agree with having the right to choose one class that has to be relative with your passion and your dreams. However they are more different opinions as my opinion,some of them might think that art and drama is what everyone needs to learn about it. But for what I have been through I support those who believes that is fair to choose one or two elective classes.",3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5

"" sometimes you can look at someone and think you can be with them forever and love them, because you have that impression that feeling,that they will never do such harm and leave you because they think problems can't get solved but once you noticed that it can, but the other person doesnt see that you can realized that is really worth it, to keep having that person that thinks problems can't be solved and always thinking negative.

At first impression you would think that bad things couldn't ever happened because you were so in loved and so attached then you see that things change. so i think is possible to change your first impression and what you really thought about that person.

Although distance learning can effect students losing focuses in their classes, nevertheless, learning away from school can help us the students to have less stress, and giving us an opportunity to take care of our brothers and sisters and attending classes without skipping classes.

Almost everyone in school is stressing about something,so attending classes online would help a lot. For example: It gives us more time to finish our work for other class and stress less, because to me having the advantage to attend online classes would help out a lot, and also i might have other classes to worry about. so having an option for us the students to attend class from home by using online or video conferencing might not sound the worst. And could help students who are suffering from anxiety and having any type of stress. By using online classes they could listen to music to clam themselves down and not having any signs of a panic attack, because in school not every class or teachers might let the students use their phone to listen to music; they might not be able to know if the student is having a panic attack, but at home if they are attending classes online and having a panic attack their parents would be there to help them clam down.

Most students need to stay home in order to help with family emergence. Research has show that almost 50% of the time if the student is not at school, then they are at home helping out with their siblings at home, doing that they skipping school and losing an education, but with online classes they can do both without skipping class or missing anything in school. Because with online class the information they need would be provided to them, if they have a laptop or computer and in case they do not have any of these technology they can just go to their local Library with their siblings and do their assessments with no worries, because their siblings would find some kind of fun to do at the library.

In conclusion attending classes online at home would benefit a lot for us the students because in case some thing happens at home they just go online at do their work without stress about losing points, to me personal attending classes online would be very helpful because I would have to stress a lot, can skip school and get some sleep.

First, technology has a lot of wed-sites which attracted to most people. Therefore, when you walk in the park or wherever you go, you will see most people with their eyes into their phone, ipad, computers or another device. As a result, there are many road accidents or even some parents lose their children in the mall.

Second, students are not productive in their classes. They do not need to read a book, to find the information what they need because everything is in the internet. In other words, technology is more intelligent than our students.

Finally, technology has ended up with our social life. Nobody what to talk with other person without use his phone. In adittion, the comunication between parents and children, can not be possible these days because they are very busy surfing on internet. They spend a lot time in their devices, when they are in the store, in the house, in the work, even in a date.

However, some people think that technology is not bad at all because it help to save people. For example, in a hospital, doctors usually use technology to do X-ray, operations and to test different body part's. This help them to do more professional their work. Also, it help to do many work outside the country. For example, if the government in our country want to send information to an allied country, it will be easier by e-mail.

Therefore, you spend hours, days, months, and years being socially with the people around you, but what if you don't want to attend to school, and decide to take classes from home?

At school, you don't only made friends and memories , you also earn and learn good advices, and you see different perspectives.

People who are not socialist tend to be ones who graduated by taking online classes; they don't know how to interact with people, because they had spent most of their life talking and interacting with their computers. Sometimes we are the cause why people rather to take online classes, we separate them by diseases, illness and mental problems, not a lot of students at school have the chance to receive help or talk with their counselor ; this is one of the reasons why people doesn't want to attend to school, and choose online classes.

A lot of cases now days about why people decide to course home school are:

Pregnancy at early age: The girls who get pregnant while they are in High School either take home school or don't go study anymore, when their belly starts growing they feel ashamed, and they tend to quit school.

The Life of Generic_Name, a 17 years old High School student , who migrate 2 years ago from Guatemala. Generic_Name's teacher was talking about the online courses, home school and other online options, in order that Generic_Name can graduate on time, she was so excited about her graduation date. She had a problem if for some reasons she decided to take the online course to finish High School on time; she couldn't speak English. So, how could Generic_Name learn to speak English, sitting all day long in front of her computer?

This is an example of a problem that many students had to face, when they are forced to do home school.

In conclusion, students won't benefit by attending classes from home, here is one the reasons why ; I am a student and sometimes I don't do the work that my teachers assign me, knowing so well, my teacher can walk where I am sitting and ask me for the assign work. So, can you imagine the online courses, students can search their answers, be on their phones, or taking care of someone while they are taking the online class, so much distraction.

Students who have difficulty with subject will have better understanding of what they are learning. It would be pleasure of people who volunteer for during school homework club.

Although some students who have difficulty with specific subject homework would be great. There will be teacher and students around. Maybe its their same teacher who teaches the same class it will be great for students. Teachers will know the weakness of student of what they need help more with during class. This is why during school homework club would be great for teacher or students. Students who work after school could come to this club too they would be able to get their homework done and still be able to work at their job.

Some homework club cost money which might be hard to pay for some families. If my school would have homework club it should be free. Not every family has 100 of dollars to pay every month for homework club. They also should have good educated teacher who knows everything about subject so they could help their students.

That would messed up students education who spend their time coming to thomework club. Speaking of that school should have great volunteers who can help their student with any subject.

The guys hate when people mess around with there shoes and they ruin it. They don't like stepping in mud and they don't doing outside work.

Kids need to work so they now how much thing are because if are just asking and asking for stuff thats not going to work out wall there going to asking for really expance things that would not like.

Everyone needs to know how much things are and work for it and not ask because that is how they are going to value something. If they buy it with there money they will know and how they need too take care of it and not buy high price stuff.

""Determine never to be idle."" He thought that is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something, and that we can accomplish more if we are a active person because the inactivity also serve a purpose in every person life.

First,It is awesome has the determination to decide how to do or what do you want to do in your life,because something we may know what we need to do but we don't take a decision to done it. And the reality is that we don't gonna know how much can be done if we don't try to do the things that we wants or needs to done.

Second,everyone has the option of accomplish much more than we think,if we are always doing something,for example,finalize any plan or idea that comes to our heads in any moment,time,or second of our lives. The big thing is never stop doing the things that we wants to achieve,and be proud of what you receive.

Third,we have the option to choose between doing something or stay inactive,because inactivity also serve a purpose. This is the big deal ,sometimes we don't imagine that we prefer do nothing without see it, we don't see what we are doing at the time. That's the power of inactivity. We have to see clearly and make a decision of what we decide to choose.

My second reason on why having good aditude is important is that say that u didnt get the job, always stay cool and not try the flash out on anyone or even put it on anyone because you can always try again and theres always jobs that are hiring and available. There are many benifets of good aditude but few benefits are making friends, having a good life with no hate in your heart, get hired at jobs u apply at and many more. Benifets of having bad aditute can lead u to a place you wont like places like Jail if u talk back and not follow instructions or evan go to jail for not paying ur bills, get a office referal for not following directions and doing bad in school too.

In addition, students can get distracted while the teacher is talking or just in general but students should use their cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes because if student needs help finding a word, students can use for emergency, and students can use their phones to check on theirs grades and any missing work.

First, If students need help finding a word, they can look it up on their phones for example, if the word is apple they can look for the definition and use it for resource.

Second, if the student has an emergency therefor, students can contact their parents if the student isn't feeling well or any problems.

Third, students can check on their phones to see if they have any missing work or any grades fix furthermore, if students can't remember if they turned in their papers, they can check on their phones to see if they turned it in. If the student has a F in the class and if students can't use their phone how will they know what grade they have in that class.

Some other students likes listening to music while they work because they can focus better. The students also can prove that they use their cell phones wisely in class.     ",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5
084763DC1C8C,"Some school district offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. There are three reasons why students may want to take this chance. First reason is that they may need to help there family out. The second reason is that the students don't want to be in school for so long. Third reason is that the students may want to go to college at a early age to get that over with at a early age and get a good financial job. They would be able to get full-time jobs at a early age with a high school diploma.

First of all one reason that it may be good for the students to graduate early because they may need to help out there families. The students parents may work but they need that extra help for their kid. Because, they are not financially good with money. So graduating a year early may help the students help out there family's. If students need to help there families out and they finish with school early they dont have to worry about having to go to school they can just work so that they can help there families out.

Another reason is that the students want to graduate school early because they don't want to be in school for so long. Students sometimes just want to start making money so they want to get over with school. They may have a job but the part-time may not get them a lot of money. So if they finish school in three years they can start working at a full-time job early and start making the money that they really want to make. Students would love to finish school in three years because they dont want to keep on going to school.

Last reason why students may want to graduate early is because students may want to go to college at a early age to get that over with at a early age and get a good financial job. Students may know what they want to become when they are older and would like to start going to college at a early age so it would benefit they if they could finish high school in three years. Also they would have a good financial job at a early age. They can also start living be them self wants they have a good financial job and out of college at a early age. Also would make good money at a early age.

In conclusion, these are three good reason why students would like to finish high school in three years. They can start helping there families at a early age because they may need the help. Also that students may not want to be in high school for so long. Finishing school at a early age they may start going to college at a early age and also get a good job at a early age.

Using technology makes our work easy and faster, it makes easy and fast by sending email, so that way some important documents the we send to our partners or coworkers without going to there office or making a meeting and these is because using email and we are saving time too, it's a easy way to send documents because they are always in time, we can't stop the use of paper and that way, we are helping the environment and us. Communicating it's a issue for many people and that is why using technology help then out because some people are scare to talk to their partners about task and critical information for the job, they get nervous and make then feel uncomfortable by talking to then, however the technology it's simple way to solve problem or communicated sending a email about the issues and there it's no oral and physical communication with other.

Summer projects can be fun, if only they were chosen by students. If the students were to pick their own projects depending on the subject; they would be interested, more likely to do it, and enjoy as well.

teachers spent a whole summer or a school year coming up with a topic for the students to do during the summer. And, it turns out that the students aren't giving it much though or effort towards their given assignment. That can be waste of the teachers time and energy, but if the students were to come up with a topic and idea of their own they would do the project.

if students were to choose their project, they would more likely to do it because its on something they want to learn and their curious. when students are curious they tend to explore their curiosity and be more drawn in the subject and want learn more about it. students can come up with great ideas when comes to doing their own projects. choosing a topic of your interest in a projects can explore students mind, and do the things they would never though of doing.

The summer project can improve your grades in the class. for example a student that struggles a lot in class either because the they cannot keep with pace in class, with summer projects they can work on their own pace. and if students are not great at working in environment full students this gives the a chance to do in depended study. summer project can give an opportunity for students to increase their greats. if students were to chose their own assignment they could at pace that worked for them, and they wouldn't have to worried about due time date. students would have the whole summer to finish the project, and if they did not finish it, when they an entire summer to do it, now that's just being lazy and it can effect their grade.

Subject can have a great impact on the student. If student is given an assignment on a certain subject their is a chance they would start procrastinate or not do it at all.

therefore they would have zero interesting on doing the summer assignment. for example if i had a history project and a science project. And if my science teacher were to give me a project to do a research paper on how gene mutate, as interesting that sounds i would not do it because science does not fascinate me as history.

Being able to choose a project of your own can be fun that way, it gives a student to look forward to do their work and be more fascinated it. Students should design their summer project; because that's less work on the teacher,

it gives them an opportunity to just think outside their box, and they can make their teachers proud for doing their work, so they can look forward a better school year.    ",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,2.5,3.0

Student will be not worring about attend school on time, if they get sick or have to travel for a emergency happen. They would have the chance of talking with their counselor and talk about sign up for online school. If the teacher give them homework they would have the chance of sending by email.

In other way been able to take classes online, give the student a chance of choosing their own schedule for example, some student might to take classes in the moprning, some student might want to take classes afternoon or at night time. Taking classes online give the student a chance of doing classes in the other side of the country or anywhere. Many student are not able to attend school.

Attending online school give the student the advantage of working or doing their own projects at home for example student won't relay on school supplies. Students by taking classes online benefits then, because some student have two jobsor lives to far, and they are to old for attending school.

For the students that have two jobs. They get the chance to use there work break to take some classes, test, or even quizzes. For example in my side of the story if my school would give online i would be able to have to jobs and support my family paying some bills. For other student have the same problem.

In my conclusion taking classes online benefits the student in many different ways. for example by choosing their opwn schedule, by given then the opportunity of doing their own things, by giving then a aesier way to learn, by showing then that they are adults now and demostrating and teaching to do take the right choose.

Although some people say that accompish does not serve a purpose, nevertheless, others say that accomplish does serve a purpose because a student could be working on homework and playing a sport.

To beging, accompish more time on a sport. For example,

a soccer team was trying to accomplish their shooting because they had a soccer game. They also knew that they could use more practice on thier shooting skills on the goalily. This shows that, the soccer team didn't want to waste time on something that they could be practeing for. Clearly,

Futhermore, accompish something on homework. This proves that, a college student wants to get their homework all done because they want to go do something fun with their friends. They could also be going out with people so they might as well get all their work done. This shows that, if a student wants to accompish something they are willing to give it a try and move on.

Well, was as Albert Schweitzer said "" Example is not the main thing to influence others"". this means that there are other ways to influence other without using or giving examples.

One way that people may get influenced is if they receive help from others, not receiving examples; This can be better than give examples to illustrate this, in the class of ceramic the teacher mostly give us examples of how to make clay stuff, she almost never help me and this results difficult for me and for others how to make things because she only explain one time how to do it and some of the students forget about it. when she help someone their project result always to be the best of the class because of her help on the student.

Other people say that when they receive examples sometimes they get confused, this happens when the examples they get make them change their perspective over what they are doing, for example: doing a drawing, sometime the teacher tells to make a drawing of your imagination,this means of your thinking and whatever is on your brain. What could happen when the teacher tell you what to draw after she said that the drawing is about your imagination and she give examples on what to draw this make you think that she wants you to draw others things that are not on your thinking, this shows that sometimes the examples does not work on specific subjects because those get to confuse you.

Although others may say that when they use examples they are more able to influence other because they show the experience that they have on it and also teach how to do something also there are many people that learn better get more influenced when they use examples. I think that there are a few ways that are stronger that make the examples less useful or powerless to influence others.

A program that offers you three years of high school has so many benefits and advantages. Its a great option, because who doesnt want to be done with high school one year early and come out ready to pursue their career or dream? It's not only about finishing school early, but in that year you also have the advantage to be offered jobs or be hired over somebody else for example, if you were competing for a job in fixing computers you would have the more experience, knowledge, and advanced while the other guy just came out of high school and is new to the work force.

This program gives you the option to have a flexible schedule and to choose whats best for your comfort. Taking courses over the summer and not being able to take electives can help you finish more early and to be available to plans for the future. You will have so much time to invest in activities that your interested or visit colleges you wish to go to, because remember your graduating early and you have to be ready for this life changing experience.

I believe that in live there is gong to be up and down and this teach us who to be an successful person.

First,to have a successful live we need the experience to be success not matter who many obstacle we have. When I was eleven I star making cookies at first I was bad, and when I fail the first try, but I keep going to make cookies not matter how bad I was. Then as I keep failing, and one day I was able to be successful. People have to know that we are not perfect and in some point of live we have to be unsuccessful to became what we one to be some day, Also it very important that people have the capability to say that they have make mistake.

Every person in this world wants to be something that could be remembered forever. To get to what they want to and dream about to achieve it, they must need to work hard, be prepared for everything, and always should be prepared for things that might be impossible to do but never give up on it at any issue. Life gets hard sometimes and gets easy by the time, but it depends on what people choose to live with. Those who choose to live happily works hard, always have positive attitude toward everything. But those who want to be successful but not working enough on it it will get nothing from it. people like ""George Washington""

who are still our heroes are the ones who knew how to get through tough ways by a positive attitude. We all have different habits, we are all different, but we can change the world through our positiveness, not by being mean and not pretend to be working hard for our needs and wants. Positive attitude the something that helps us get ride of our daily problems, doing something in a good way makes is a way to our goal becoming true with no tension. If we want to make our dream come true we have to make it in a good and positive way without hurting anyone, and by loving everyone. the only thing everyone absolutely have to know is that a positive attitude and thinking positive is the way we could get ride of our bad habits and live live in peace. We can't make it through our hard times if we just sit there and don't do what we should to ourselves and other needy people. We all have to be patient, not everyone gets stuff so easily, to achieve something it takes time but we all have to be prepared for things we will face. We might won't make it through in our first try,

but we should never quit trying. Everything takes times and have it's own limit to get fixed. There are two things that are above all else, one is work hard, and the second one is work hard in silence but in a positive and a good way. positive attitude is the important thing in our daily life. It's not that we have to be 100% so we could get all we want, we all know not everyone in this world is perfect so we have to do things by what we really could do, the only thing that would help us in everything is positive attitude. Nowadays everyone think they could do everything without trying the best they could, and try it in a positive way, but i think they are wrong. If you want to get the same respect s everyone else you need to have a positive mind toward every different thing in this world. Whenever things keep goes wrong we need to ask our selves that are we doing what we suppose to do, are we being what our parents and our country taught us to be, so that way we could stop thing to go from right to wrong and stay positive in every way. before we start to do something new we need to ask someone that is experienced, so we will not get lost in the middle. Never give up on anything in this world things are not hard, we are the ones who makes them difficult to do. We are not pot in this world for keep quitting things to get to our goal, we are here alive to create change in world, to love people, to love the tradition, to keep doing positive and effective things for our generation and the upcoming generations. We are born to make people smile. We are not for hate, we are for love. We all should be trying to change the negative thought to a positive thought. When we have problem to solve, we need to think twice and think positive because that solution would defiantly impact others too. We should all try hard to be in a metier type place. In my opinion everyone should be thinking about how to be successful, how to be something better, how to make others feel better, and make them pot him/her as an idol. we all should always take responsibility for our action and consequences. If you want to be something memorable you have to be the change what others would like in you, and you are the one who could make it through hard and tough ways by a positive attitude. We are the ones who can change the world by just be different and make things easy and effective in a good and positive way. I know we do not want the world to go for hate and negative way instead of a positive and right way with full of benefits. If we want to work somewhere and we don't have control on our bad behavior and have negative attitude towards the boss and other workers we will not be successful, but if we do have control on our positive and negative attitude we will always be successful and always would get promotion in every place we are.

0F32DDCBECB6,"It is important try to do your best for conserve energy and resources. But, I am disagree that my school follow this model and change to a four day school week and extend the school day two hours. Even if maybe it can have some benefits but as student i think it can have many disadvantages for us. And if we want to conserve energy and resources we can do it follow others methods.

I am not in favor of that my school follow this model for some reasons. First, thIs proposal could affect most to the students in many ways for example if they extend the school day two hours I think it is to much time at school it will be so stressful for the students and teachers as well. Another reason is because many students have to work a part time after school. So, if they extend the school day two hours is possible that the students who have to work after school will can work only few hours and some of them really need to work after school becase maybe they live by themself and they have to pay rent and anothers bills it means they need the money. Then, this students who have to support by themself maybe they will can not go to school any more if the school accept this new proposal because they have to work .

Another disadvantage is that it will be stessfull if we have to do our homework after have been almost whole day at school. Next, some students have to help their parents after school for example they have go to pick up their little brothers from school and take care of them or they have to cook, clean up the house, wash diches, do the loundry and other stuff. So, if the students have to do this things they will don't have time to do their homework. Then, those students who have to work or help their parents after school will be so affect if the school follow this model maybe their grades will decrease because they don't do their homework or they don't sleep well if they don't sleep well they will be distract and not paying attention in classes.

Another reason why i am not in favor is because sometimes maybe we want to hang out with friends, go visit your family and spend time with them but if we leave late school maybe we will be tired or have things at home to do. So, we will not have a time for that and sometime we need time for ourself, time to rest but if we have work, do homework, school we can not it is so stressfull. Then, the students will not concentrate at school nor work.

There are some benefits too for example for some students who don't have to work or help their parents after school so they can rest when they get back from school and they will have time to do their homework. Also they can hang out with his friends or go visit his families on weekends.

Another benefit is that if we have only four day school the students will have one day left that can use to work all day or do other things like homeworks, go play soccer or other things for fun. So, with this model we can have 3 days without school and work those days and study thet other four days if we live with our parents or someone who support us then if the schooIl follow this model wll not affect us and it is a great option.

In conclusion i am disagree to my school follow this model because i think it will afect the student and as student i want to be successful and reponsible with my homeworks. Also, for those students who have to work they have to be competent in their jobs to not get fire because they need the money.              ",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0

students would focus better if they did not have a other classmate talking to them.

101576652D3B,"The British naturalists and politician John Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it. I agree with this statement because people should know how to make decisions themselves instead of relying on others to do it for us.

Although we are surrounded by people who influence us ever since we where young, people should choose their own character because people should make decisions by themselves more often. Everyone isn't the same, and we shouldn't always be taught to follow what we see everyone do. It's important that we make choices by ourselves because by doing so, it makes us stronger humans beings who can rely on ourselves and helps us gain self confidence and makes us rely on ourselves more often then we do.

Even though Influences help you know what's right from what's wrong, people should choose the person they want to because the people you know might be setting bad examples and you wouldn't even know that they're wrong because they told you it's right. For example, growing up, your guardians could be anyone. They could be good people, or they could be not so good people. It's our job to use common sense and decide for ourselves what's right and what's wrong. It's always good to use your brain and decide if something is morally right or wrong. If you see someone close to you being a bad influence, then one must learn to not replicate those actions, but instead make good decisions their selves.

Some might say that influences help if you're lost or confused in life, however, another reason why people should create their own character is because attempting something on your own and not succeeding helps you grow as a person. For example, if you just follow what everyone else is doing, you won't learn because thats the equivalent of you being spoon fed. If you dont attempt anything of your own, you won't know how to do anything by yourself. By always letting people make decisions for you, you won't be able to complete tasks on your own and makes you a less independent person. This is why making your own decisions is important. Not only does it help you grow as a person, but it also strengthens your mind.

In life, people often rely on others to build the person they are but in reality, it's better to rely on yourself instead of others to make decisions because it makes us rely on ourselves more often then we do, helps us avoid bad influences, helps you grow as a person, and strengthens our minds. All of these things are why we should all grow up by making our own choices and decisions instead of mindlessly do what everyone else does. People have all the power in their selves to be who they want to be. You're no one other than yourself after all, and that's the most important thing to think about when choosing our own character traits.",4.5,4.0,5.0,4.5,4.0,4.5

Junk food isn't healthy for student do to how less active they have become. Monday through Friday students have lunch everyday and may eat the same unhealthy food. sometimes it's good to eat junk food once in a while.

Healthy and nutrisous food help students become more active and stronger. For example, nutrisous food would help students become active during their classes and after school activities. Having something small to eat like a chicken salad may help students from sleeping, being lazy to become more social, and having a healthier mindset. Students wouldn't have to worry much about getting sick or having some sort of stomach problem.

Students should feel good about themselves having to eat healthy. While students eat healthy and nutrisous meal they're keeping their body from shutting down on themselves. eating healthy effects students in good ways by keeping them fit and strong.

10A367BB87EB,"Based on Emerson's statement, I firmly agree that if you never try to do something beyond what you already know, you will never do something and know if you could have done it or of you were good at it. Based on my experience, for what I've live and for what I know, I strongly believe and agree with this statement. My brother for example wanted to be an engineer, with hard work and effort he made it. In the other hand we have Hitler, he went from being a simple art student to one of the most exponent dictators of Germany.

For example, my brother wanted to be an engineer since he was little, at the time he reach High school, he was sure what career he wanted for his future. He started taking courses that would help him get credits for college and getting involve with sports that would help him get scholarships. Also, he took classes that would help him improve his skills and understanding of his future career. Now with hard work and effort, he graduated as an engineer from Generic_school and he's happily working with his dream job. This shows that with hard work you can accomplish any goal and letting yourself grow.

Another example was Hitler, he went from being a simple art student to one of the most exponent dictators of Germany. At a young age Hitler had a dream, he wanted to study arts, he started working on it, but when he apply to college he wasn't accepted. That was the moment when Hitler decided to do something different, and experience something new that could change his life. With hard work and patience he did it. Even though he fail the first time, he didn't give up, therefore, he became a dictator.

Some people say that you should do what life gives you at the moment because even if you work hard, sometimes you don't reach what you were hoping for and the work is not even worth it, however, you should always try to do something to grow because if you don't, that's when life gets too bored, you don't have to be in the same spot your entire life. You need to let yourself expand and fly to grow and experience something beyond what you already know, something that will make proud at the end of the day.

In conclusion I agree with Emerson's statement that if you never try yo do something beyond what you already know, you will never grow and never have experience something out of your comfort zone. You'll never know if what you could have done was worth your time, which is why you should always try to something beyond what you have already master and challenge yourself to do bigger things that you never knew you could.

10AC7944DC4A,"Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" this means that if people fail they should get back up and try again and if they fail once more to never give up. Some people think that if you fail you should just give up right then and there. some people say that if they give up when they fail they should get up and try again and never loss hope, to determined, and to dedicate on what they are trying to achieve.

Everyone person fails in some point of their lives its part of life to fail no one is perfect. people should never loss hope if they fail they should be determined to make it through and be successful. Hope is so important in peoples lives because lets say if someone loses they child and if that person losses hope they would stop looking for their child and if they stop looking for their child they will never find him or her. Failure is important in peoples lives because it make people to not lose hope but also it makes them to dedicate on what they are trying to succeed.

People should dedicate on what they are trying to achieve or on what they want to succeed. dedication is very important in everyone lives. Cristiano Ronaldo is so dedicated to soccer that is why he is so successful he was playing in the best league in Spain now he is paying in the best league in Italy. many people admire Cristiano Ronaldo because started from the bottom and now he is one on the best player and is one the player that gets payed the most.

in conclusion, people should never loss home and they should be dedicated to be successful. Having hope is very important to succeed, also to succeed people need to be dedicated and determined. In other words, to succeed people need to fail and get back up again and again. ",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5
112AA24D20BC,"Some years ago before my uncle became a doctor, I saw how he was struggling with anxiety attacks of too much studying time at medical school, but he noticed that he needed to do different activities to get distracted a little bit and at the same time get rid of all the stress. Every student participating at least in one extracurricular activity is a really good idea because they could do sports, get in book clubs or help around doing community service. If all the students would do extra activities , they're lives could be really different and better in many ways with variations of experiences and less stress.

Students doing any sports would be really helpful for their health. Mostly every student at school is seating on a chair for hours and at home they are probably just also seating on the couch for more hours . A human body needs to move and do some exercise to have a good health. Sports are really a good ting that makes your body feel or have some changes just like on teens they're metabolism makes them get taller or develop their bodies. Even if the students do just 20 minutes a day stills helpful for them.

Book clubs are something really interesting and fun for students to do. Do you ever just feel like your mind needs a break? Well books are the best option as a break , they take you to many different places around the world even places that dont even exist without moving from anywhere you are at. You can find new adventures, drama, romance and some things you never experienced; just like transferring your mind to another world, and distracting you from your regular life. Making you have and enjoy some good time without going somewhere. In the book clubs you can discuss with people about all those thoughts you have about what you just read, and could also find someone that thinks the exact same things as you.

Doing community service not only helps others, it also helps you! You might be asking yourself right now how? Well, helping your community it's teaching you as a student how important cooperation is , helping others brings you happiness, and that feeling of how responsible you are becoming. Also, community service helps students a lot with credits for an advanced diploma or even a scholarship for college. If you never have helped your community thinking is nothing fun, you should consider it as a extracurricular activity that you can do.

Every student should do an extracurricular activity after schools so theyre body and mind can have an productive break. Any type of activity helps you and relax's you when need a break. Choose something to do that you like and after school finishes then do everything you can in that time.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5
11E9348F5072,"In this prompt we are going to talk,and choose if we accomplish more by doing more things in the world,or does inactivity also serve a purpose or not. We all have a different opinion when it comes to things like this choosing between something different. Well we actually do accomplish more if we do more things for an example say someone wants to become a doctor we go to collage, we do things,and we learn, after doing all that we all accomplish something because we all did something to succeed what we love. Therefore a reason why doing more makes a person accomplish something is because doing more,and learning more teaches someone things they never learned before. So by that we mean that once a person learns something they have never done before they start loving it and start doing it. Other reasons and examples why doing more is better is because when the person does more they have all the energy to do it which is honestly a good thing because once a person learns something that person just wants to go to collage,graduate, and succeed which is something we all want. Here is an example why it is that we study a lot and try to learn things it is because we want to grow up,succeed on what we love doing,and also to accomplish new things we have always wanted to try. When you start learning new things,and get the hang of it all everything will just become easier for someone,and also things they always wanted to do will just become easier for that person too. Another thing is that when we keep doing things it will just be done faster like it said in the prompt something Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" which is honestly facts we do get things done faster if we just keep doing it, if we just keep trying without stopping, and i mean yes taking breaks on important things is good because we all do need breaks at some point to be honest but also getting things done is better and once someone gets things done they feel really proud of themselves, all of us do because it is a good feeling to finish things that were hard,and stressful. Another good feeling is having nothing to do when you are accomplishing things,and succeeding too.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0
120FE0B76D5C,"Imagine if you are in school and they decide to change to a four days of school, but they also will extend the school day two hours. your parents get angry because is the closest school you have and it's fifty minutes away from home. what would you do if your house is to far away? school should change to a four days school because students who live far away will get tired, the students who work after school will lose their jobs, and will not have enough time to spend with their family. these changes will bring problems for these students and I will tell you why.

First: Students who live far away will get tired. these students will not have enough time to do their homework because of the time they spend in their journey back to home. This may be a problem for the students who want to stay after school. they will be not able to do it because of the time. In my case i'm tired because I don't have the enough time to sleep. scientist say that students might sleep for nine hours, but I can't because of the time I spend working after school.

Second: These new changes will bring problems for the students who work after school. They may lose their jobs because they can't be on time. The students who live by their own will not have the money to pay for the things they need in order to graduate. 50% is the percentage of students, who work after school and they will get in serious problems if the school makes these changes. They will get bad grades, tired, and also this can make a person to think about doing bad things such as robbery or drugs.

Finally; These students will not have the time to spend with their parents. parents enjoy spending their free time in the afternoon, but this is a problem because of the four days of school. student do not have the time for their parents, because they arrive home late. these students will feel they are alone without any support. because os the amount of time the have with their families.

Some students say it is a great idea to change to a four days of school. but they are wrong because of the students who live far away, it will be hard to finish their studies.

In conclusion school should not change to a four days to because students will get tired, lose their jobs and will not have the time to enjoy with their family.    ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0

Based on my experiences, I agree with Mr. Emerson. Because in order for a person to grow, that person will have to do an certen task, to help that person reach that goal or goals. There are difference things a person can grow in like: school, career, and hobbies.

In school a person learned skills to help a person in the further such as, wrighting, reading, vocabulary, history, and math etc. A person will learned, how to talk to other people, and how to act, by making friend. Also in school like, community collage, can help a person can also developing jobs skills, for further career.

Another thing you can grow in, is careers. A person can grow in their career by going up their working rank I am currently working at Searchs and I am the supervisor their. At first, I got hired as a cashier. It took me a while, but I got my way up there.

Hobbies is another thing you can grow in. People can learning and practicing skills to help them up prove their's hobbies. One of my many hobbies, is drawing. When I was six, I can only draw sticks finger. I have taken many art classes to help me develop my drawing skills. Now I can draw a human with details.

12FE853D6B88,"I agree with Emerson's statement because people should be themselves no matter what. You want to always show the real you. That is the beuty of life,connecting with different types of people with different types of personalitys. People in this world now a days are cruel and mean that have no heart. People bully others because of theres clothes,shoes, and how they look. You can get bullied for anything now a days, its very sad. That's why people who get bullied hate themselves and want to become something they are not.

I remember one point in my life, i was deppressed. I kept getting bullied because of how big my head was or how skinny i was. I know it sounds funny, i laugh all the time when i talk about it dont worry. I stopped wanting to come to school because of that. I never wanted to leave my house or talk to anyone. It was very sad. But one day one of my close friends asked me why i wasn't coming to school, and i told him everything. He told me straight up to ignore all the negative stuff that people call me and live your life to the fullest. Since that day, we have been bros for life. He always had my back and i always had his. A few weeks passed and i told my mother. We talked for a few hours about how i should ignore all the negative stuff because life is so short that you can't let anything stop you. That really changed me and how i see life.

Trying to be yourself in this world is very difficult now a days. Just by telling someone that there shoes are ugly can really change the whole person. They start buying stuff that they don't really like. Also doing stuff they don't want to do. Suddenly they start doing bad stuff. Just to fit in with other people that have all the nice clothes and shoes etc. People really can't be themselves because of judgment.

There should be more help in this world so people that are going through this can get help. People should be motivated to be themselves and also love themselves. Some people can really say somethig mean and the victim could commite suicide, just because of someones judgment. People should start treating other people with respect. Parents should start teaching there kids early on how to show respect. People shouldn't care about someone elses opinion. People should live there lifes to the fullest.

People should feel very accomplished to be themselves in this world. People really make you feel like trash when they say something negative about you. There is always going to be negative stuff coming at you, that's normal. That is what makes you stronger and turns you into a great human being.

144671E445D0,"A British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote ""Do you think that we choose our own character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control?"". Well some people believes we choose our own character traits or influences by our control. Other people doesn't agree that we choose our own character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control. I think that we choose our character traits, or our character is formed by influences beyond our control because we're doing things that maybe enjoy doing, or we get to choose what we want to be. And I am going to talk about this and why I agree on this.

I Agree that we get to choose our character traits or formed by influences beyond our control because you get to do anything when it comes to you becoming what you wanna be. Another reason is that no one can control you on how you should be later on in the future. I also think that doing the things you like to do would change you for example, helping people that are in need will make you a better person because you're controlling yourself on what you are doing. Another example is that if you're doing bad things, it would make you a bad person because of your actions. That's why people think we change our character traits by choosing our own or formed by influences from our controls.

Other people doesn't agree that we can change our own character traits or formed by influences from our controls because they think it cannot change their own character traits from the actions they do. Also many doesn't believe that doing what they wanna do won't change them later on in the future. Another reason is because they dont believe that we cannot choose our own character traits and that it should only be 1 trait about yourself. For example doing something positive wouldn't effect them because they can easily change and do something negative later in the future. Last thing is that they don't think we get to choose our own traits and basically say that we are born the way we are without changing our character traits.

This makes me think if people who does't believe that they can change their character traits or controlling their influences can be a bad thing for them. the reason why i think it's a bad thing is because they don't think they can't change the way they act with actions they do normally. For example, they think doing positive actions would not change their character traits. Changing your character traits can make you a better person because of the positivity you are spreading.

if you spread positivity or have a good mindset could change your character traits.

So in this essay i believe that people can change their character traits or formed by influences beyond our control. I say this because you can choose what you wanna be or act later on in life. Another reason is any actions people can do also makes them change their character traits. This is very good if you treat others with respect; you will be a positive person. This will also help you in life because if you think down you wouldn't be motivated, but you can change that by doing something nice to yourself or to someone. That will give you a good mindset and want to do it more often if it helps you feel motivated by making someones day .",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.5
1451EA314B8A,"Students in the classroom always debate about working alone, or in groups, both of the ways of work have beneficial and non beneficial aspects,In fact; some students do not like to work in groups, they may say things like people in their groups do not do anything ,and they would rather to work by themselves, but in my personal opinion working in groups is a better idea. When students work in groups they can divide the assignment in different pieces, in that way it can be easier for each person in the group, another aspect to think about is that students in the group can help out each other. Working in groups will also be less stressful for each person in the group.

First, when students work in groups they could perfectly divide the assignment in small portions. for instance, if they have a project about global warming, they could tell each person to find something different, one person can find the characteristics of global warming, a different person the reasons why it happens, and someone else some examples of the topic.

Second, students always need help ,and they could help each other in the group. Help out each others in the group is a good way to develop team work, it may help them when they go to college, or after when they grow up and have jobs. Furthermore, teach students about team work is a really beneficial aspect to think about because students are the future of this society, and teach them how to work with others is going to help them to develop an open-mind.

Another important thing is that they would have less stress, if they work as a team and divide the work, they will feel less stress, also they are going to find more time to work in different assignments from different classes. In addition, if they have more time for others classes their grades may increase, and they will have a better academic performance.

To summarize, working in groups have a lot of beneficial aspects, students may grow as a person and develop different values when they work as a team, also they will learn more as individuals something that the new generation needs, students will also accomplish new things and be more successful.

Every high schooler's"" dream is to walk on stage with a big smile on his/her face. but if you don't do the necessary part of passing your Sol and getting good

Many high school er""s sometimes want to leave high school and go to college because they want to live on their own, out from home,experience new things, meet new friends, or even meet new people and learn about other things and also sometimes too student graduate early or want to graduate early because they don't. like their school or get bullied a lot in high school due to that they try their possible best to leave the school before something happen to him/her.

But from my point of view I think every high school er should wait till their traditional four years of high school because college can be very very stressful if you not well organized or you not well fit.

And also before you make a decision to go to college or even work force or maybe start a life right after high school, make sure you are financially stable because college or anywhere else after high school will be very tough and very challenging.

Preparing to graduate early and go to college a year early it's very hard sometimes because you wouldn't know what you want do in college and you will be on a waiting list and you will have to pay for every semester which is going to be a waste of money and also time . so i think every high schooler's should wait till their traditional four years and be more prepared and financially stable before they graduate .

1535E922B3AA,"One topic that is frequently debated today is that to conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four_day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. people is discussing if school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours.

Some people think that this is not a good idea because if that happened students, teachers, and all staff would work more and they are going to get tired more easily. And these four days would be consider more longer than five normal days, Also maybe school would required more things to graduate and to complete these requirements it would take more time Also people think that school should have any other ideas to conserve energy without changing the days of school. for example: turn off lights when we do not need it, open the Windows etc..

I think that extending school two more hours would be very difficult for us because almost all the students have to work after school and some have full time and that required to work more that four days so if school is more long we would not complete with our jobs. And i think that if we use the energy how we have to, that would make a big difference. Also i think that if we get opinions from other people outside of the school we would have more good ideas of what to do to conserve all energy.

I believe that study just four days should be more difficult to learn we probably get more easily tired because would be ten hours each day And and if we see and think if school is only four days we have to wake up more early and go home more tardy and actually the energy would be the same amount as five days there is just a little difference between five to four days of school. Also if we get tired maybe i think would be more difficult to learn.

Finally to decided the best solution we need to give our opinion and discuss it. And I believe that more than one student need more time than others to learn because in my experience is really really hard to learn new things,

new units, new information, and if we have only four day it make more difficult for many students. Also as we see, there is many ideas to conserve energy and very easy to catch up like in the first paragraph there are two very useful ideas how to conserve the energy, without taking away any day.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0

Should people make their own decisions about life important matters,or should they ask someone else for their opinion.

People should ask for guidance from experts about life important matters.

There are times when depression comes and stress appears because,of bad decisions made by one-self.

If people do not ask for experts guidance, there is a possibility that in the future the decision they have made, might affect them in the future and cause a fatality like, depression which can lead to deadly thoughts and mental problems like bipolarity.

Depression is one of the most know in all over the world which is caused by,bad decisions,over working by mental and physical jobs, family problems, and an unhealthy life style which all of this can lead to suicide thoughts.

For example, one of the most famous singers from United States Sia known for her most popular song ""chandelier"", she committed many bad decisions which had lead her to drug addiction.

Her fame was getting higher; and many contracts for more shows where she had it to attend to, were exploding her head which lead it to an over working stage.

She has an amazing soprano voice, with more than five different tones, and because of that, different music productions wanted to sign a contract with Sia, but she instead of taking a rest she decided to continue, knowing in which stage her body was passing through, she decided to take drugs to cover her stress but, instead of taking away her stress she became a drug addict which lead her to suicide, but thanks to the doctors she is alive; now she keeps being one of the most popular singers but, because of her pass, she covers her face with long hair bangs to the top of her upper lip; and no own has seen her face since that incident.

Also, bad decisions might lead to mental problems like bipolarity, and sadly most of the cases are seen in schools where parents and teachers do not notice until is late for that youth to recover, because of his or her bad decisions that this students had made.

For example, a student from a school in Virginia known for his great intellectual was passing through a rough time, he had to go to work every single day after school from Monday to Monday his hours to school were from 7:30 Am to 2:15 Pm, and his work hours were from 2:30 PM to 10:30 PM every single day.

He never gave up he always was the top student of his class, but there were times where his parents were putting more pressure, and Test were near to come and work was getting more and more exhausted until one day he exploded.

The day of hes graduation arrive and his most treasure sister wasn't able to accompany him because she was getting into the same stage that he already pass through.

After his graduation he wanted to have a life and do what he always wanted to do since he was a child which was being in the Marine, he was already in a bad state because of all the pressure he gent through but, he wanted to fallow his dream.

One Saturday in the morning he decided to apply for the Marine but, sadly he was not accepted because of his migratory circumstances and because of that, hes brain collapsed in a stage of dementia, but his mother instead of giving an affection, she got mad and told him ""Stop, you are a man already, act like one"", the only one who tried to calm him down was his little sister who did not know what to do but to say ""He needs some experts help, he needs to go to see a doctor in that way, we can make a good decision and know what to do"".

After all of this happened he went to a mental hospital where he was hospitalized for three long months and now he is living a life with medications from an expert who helped him to go through all of this where he was diagnosed with bipolarity.

In conclusion, if someone wants to make a decision which is about their life importance is better to ask an expert and prevent all this things to happen in that way there can be a reduction in mental problems and suicide attempts.",2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
15B68B826F8D,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" He believe people should try to do something new beyond what they already know. Being good at new things can make you feel more confident with yourself. I agree that people should try to do something new beyond what they already mastered because trying to do something new can make you feel more confident and experimenting something new can make you discover more about yourself.

To begin with, trying to do something new can make you feel more confident with yourself. People can be more success in life knowing more things. If people are always scared on doing something else they will not have experiences in life and It can be hard for them to grow. For Example, I was working in a restaurant for so long I really knew how to do that job, but I wanted another job to get more money; however, I was scared on getting a new job, I thought I was not going to be good in at that, then someone told me that I should try that I will never know if I am good at something if I do not try. Now, I working in a new job, I am more confident, and I am one of the best workers in the restaurant. Therefore, If people do not try to do something new because they do not feel like good at that, they will never know if they were one of the best. Growing is part of trying if you failed, then you will learn from your experience.

Second, experimenting something new can make you discover more about yourself. Sometimes you have to let go what you already mastered and start experimenting more about life, so you can not be stack on the same thing. Grow is difficult for the people who do not have experiences in life. For instance, When I came to this country I was so scared on learning a new language and how people will treat me, but start interacting with new people, learning about their countries, and trying different foods. Now, I can say that I have learn so much from other people and I realized that interacting with other people can make me grow in a way that I can feel more confident when I am around people. So, experimenting something else can make people matured and smart as well.

On the other hand, some people say that trying to do something beyond what you already mastered, do not make you grow. They say that people that are good at something should not be evolved in something else because they could get lost knowing different things, but I believe people will never get lost learning new things, learning is the key of growing. For Example, my friend is soccer player he is really good and he started learning to play baseball, he became good at both sports. That shows that people can be good at different things at the same time without lost what they already know. Therefore, trying something new can make you good at different things and discover talents that you did not know that you have.

To conclude, trying to do something else beyond what you already mastered will make you grow. People can discover more about themselves, grow with the experiences on tying to do something, and if they failed they will learn from that. Life give us that opportunity to mastered different things, learning something new make us be more confident and success on life. We should try to do something else maybe we are not good at that, but at least we try to do it and get something with us. Life could be bored if you are stack doing what you already know and not trying something else.",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5
15D10C4DBA29,"Have you ever assist a older student and a younger student from involving a program? It is better from involving a program so they can talk to each other and communicate others, if they are struggling with some work or if they need to stay after school which is important for them to get good grades.

I agree that older students should assist younger students from involving a program because they can help together and cooperate together, if older students want to enjoy a after school activity if they like being it, they can learn about social skills.

I think that cooperating together for students is good because they can hang out and talk with their phones while their at school and they can work as a group of doing a project which is good for them to do if their kind of bored and they can work together of doing a skit or a play or act they like to do and last they should book buddy which that means reading as a group or playing card games each other.

I think that older students like to enjoy a after school activity because they like to do video games because i know that some students always stay after school for video games because they like it a lot they like to play games each other which i play video games with my friend, and students might say 'Yay' i like to stay after school to play video games again.

I think that students should learn social skills, because they can educate themselves of liking it, and there is a another club that is called Personal development which is a good club of social skills so that students like it a lot and their is some fun things that students like one of the activities are really fun for them.

In conclusion, students should help together from cooperating together because they can get to know themselves and they can be happy and they award themselves from accomplishing goals that they do is important for them, and if they get all A's they can improving themselves from their teachers saying "" Students have accomplished their goals because they are on time to class they respect teachers, and students working and cooperating together of doing kinds of work they like to do is best for them.

161E5C8A6719,"Studies has been showed that students that been committing to their dream career before entering high school would be most likely to get their career more successful than other students. However, it'll be a stressful/pressure thing for students because they would have to achieve it faster than others. The issue of students committing to a career at a young age is a stressful, mental thing, should not be considered because students would be more stress, they would focus on their future career and not themselves and high school makes everyone change their minds.

My firsts reason why students should not commit to their career at a young age is because they would be more stress throughout high school. Yes, high school seems like an easy place to stick to your future career but at the same time it's really not. If you commit to your career throughout high school, your're more likely to be stress because you feel like okay if i do this i'll achieve faster but not at the same time if i do this i won't be achieving. So technically you just put yourself in a position that you really can't get yourself out of. You're focus on one thing that in your other classes it's hard to think or studied about. Yes, committing is easy but it's not. Its's high school the place where your education change you. You would probably change your mind no time soon. Therefore, don't put yourself in the position to be stress.

Pressure is a main key to everything nowadays because it's ""fun"". However, it is not. Being put on pressure is the most hardest thing to be in because you feel like you have to do it to make someone or somebody proud. Like in this case your future career. You feel like you're pressure because you want to make your parents, teacher, your school admins proud and know that you can really commit to things. As days or weeks goes on, the pressure level goes up and up and when that goes up you kinda get depressed, sad and not yourself because you are doing this for them and not you.

High school changes everyone mind. As soon as, you walk into high school it's not the typically high school movie you think. It is place where students and teachers minding their selves and doing their know things. Middle school vs. High school are two different place. The classes are harder, high school have many many electives to pick from so like of course you are going to change so like why would you want to stick to your career at a young age when your haven't taken those other classes. Like your never know what you actually like when you have tried taken those classes.

In my personal opinion i would not commit to career at a young age. i learned from experiences and from other. Take the classes that you like in high and if you like keep moving on. If not, move to a different one. What your see on TV is not want you see in reality. So again in my opinion

Everyone is different, you are different. career is just a word. Don't push yourself at a young age. ",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0
16B45E8AA9F3,"Honestly i think being honest can't always be hard or sometimes easy because, when you did something wrong you feel guilty, telling the truth gets rid of the guilt that you had, and also you feel a lot of stress. Letting the stress out in your body is good at one point so be honest!

Your body will feel like your hiding something and be afraid to talk so just be honest,

for an example, you broke your moms favorite vase but she doesn't know yet. ""You"" may be afraid to even talk to mother because ""you"" wont know if ""you should lie or be honest or you might even feel like you will get in trouble.

It's good to be honest because your parents will feel like they can trust you for an example being home by yourself and taking care of your younger siblings . If your not honest your parents might think that you're lazy and dont actually take care of your siblings while there out grocery shopping.

Not being honest can cause problems with you and your parents relationship. It's your job to be grateful of your parents, what they give you and how much they support you. If you have a friend who is good with their parents maybe try being like them and try your best to love and appreciate your parents at this moment.

Now that you know how to appreciate your parents and be honest and not lie, let me tell you this we all know we will lie maybe once or twice but after you can just say, ""Hey I'm sorry i was not telling the truth, will you forgive me?"" Everything will all be better. Be more respectful say it with love and like you actually mean it. People will feel loved and that they actually mean to you.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0
16C794A0F479,"students should not be allow to use their cellphone during class time only if it is necessary or with the teacher permission.

One of the most important reason why you should not be allow to use your phone during class is because the cellphone really distract you, it may be because you're playing, text ting or listening music.

Cellphone can be a big distraction for the student for to many reasons, sometimes students do not really think like that, but on my opinion it is a big distraction, using the cellphone during class can make you miss important parts from the class that you may need for a future test that maybe one of the answer can be that small part that you didn't hear because you were on your phone, but the teacher is not the responsible from your actions, you take your own decisions,and you choose the decision to look at your phone than pay attention at class. in other parts teachers should make that their rules for the classroom has appraisal, and make the students respect them, or if the teacher can't do that at least the school can make that rule.

Some times you're just pretending that you are paying attention, but you're not really paying attention for the reason that you may be at your phone or answering a text, i am saying this because it happened to me and i do the same, i know some students has the same situation and others that can't live without their cellphone. it can be addictive. some times I think it can because the age, we are just young persons and some persons think different they really come to study but others just come because they have to.

The effects of being using the cellphone at class are that you not really pay attention at class and you fail the class. cellphones are not necessary at class and it's not educational or helpful for you to remained or learn things. On my person i fail classes because the same situation, i fail classes and if i fail classes i'll fail the school year and then wont would like to repeat other school year. That gonna make me think about that and i don't would like to come to school because i feel like i loose my time coming to school to repeat it every single day. i think cellphone make you stupid and act like a dumb because when youre on your phone, you are like in other world, you don't pay attention on what is happening around you. you are loosing time from your life time that you can use study or do others necessary and important things for your life. i see students that they just dgf and they on their phone during class, i'm one of them, lol.

On my opinion, cellphone can be necessary some times, but i dont really need it during class because i come to study, take notes and do my best in class for have good grades, i will say that cellphone can be use only during test, classwork because i am that kind of person that likes to be listening relax songs and doing my job. in other way schools gives you a laptop and i think the only thing where you can do all of those things is the computer, i can use Google or YouTube, it's not necessary to have your phone on your hands.

How can we solve this issue? teachers should collect all cellphones before start class, and make a rule that something gonna happen if he/she see someone with their phone, so students may have to respect this rule.

All this conversation i think the problem is not cellphone, i think the problem is technology because humans are depending from technology and and it makes them fool, todays technology can be more smart than a person. if you really read to this side you should understand how is life now, you may be older and smarter than i am, but we both lived different generations, it is all my decisions, we have to control technology not technology has to control us. legalize ;)",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5

My first reason why we should have more time at5 school is getting work done. If theres more time at school,then theres more time to do your homework at school. Getting your homework done so you dont have to do ot at home because you finish your work at school. My reason is getting work done.

My second reason why we should have more time at school is your friends. School can get boring so thats why you have friends so you can hangout with them at school. Your friends can be your work buddy so you and your friends can work together at school so you can finish your work. You can have fun with your friends at school so it wont be so boring i school. My other reason is your friends.

My third reason why we should have more time at school is your grades. Is your grades bad? Well you can make it up because theres more time at school. If you have more work and if you get a good grade on it,the your grade will go up. Theres more time at school so you can make up work that you did bad on because theres more time at school.

1721F085F81E,"I disagree with this statement because your first impressions of someone or something can change overtime. When you first meet someone you automatically get an impression of that person from the way they dress, or the way they speak basically the way they do things.

Now a days people jump into conclusions, they never met the person, they just go off upon looks. For example say a teenager is wearing all black with ripped jeans and they got their pants down low, adults are going to think that teen is possible a gangster or a thug but thats not the case, thats just the style now a days.

First impression can change overtime, once you get used to something your mindset changes, say you meet a friend and you guys start talking and your friends starts giving you an attitude, your going to assume that your friend doesn't like you so you keep that mindset. Yall start talking again and this time it's going way better, you and your friend are laughing, overall just having a good time now your opinion has changed towards the person.

there was this guy he started to stare at me every few seconds so i thought he had a problem or something but he looked familiar but i couldn't figure out where i've seen him from, later that day he ended up being in my last block class, the teacher made the class work in pairs so i got up and asked the guy if he wanted to be my partner, he said sure and we began working, we started talking about random things until he said ""you look familar"" then he said didn't we go to the same middle school together, then it clicked I was friends with this guy back in middle school and haven't seen him in a long time, after that day we began talking almost everyday.

17230E94E6CF,"Do you think that the failure is a reason to don't reach the hit. my opinion about the ""success"" is that no everyone find the easy way to catch up the hit. I am agree with the minister Winston Churchill because failure is not a option to loss our enthusiasm and don't realize our goals. Also,the enthusiasm is a good reason to stay what do you doing in your life. Then, we learn of the failure and that cause to make a important decision in our life.

Failure is not a option to loss our enthusiasm and don't realize our goals. First, the life is not easy and always will be a fall on the way to the hit. Second, there is people that they don't like to see you and the top and they try to cause us a fall to don't realize our goals but also it's a people that help you to catch up our goals . In conclusion, there is no reason to you give up to realize your goals and go up to the hit.

The enthusiasm is a good reason to still in what do you want pursuit of success. initially, the enthusiasm is a motivation in our life to reach the hit that you want in your life. also, the enthusiasm help you to never give up when you fall down. Then, failure is a bad experience but if we try to be positive person and find another way to be a successful person. In conclusion, the enthusiasms a tool that will help to grow up and find the way to be a successful person in our life.

we learn of the failure and that help to grow up to the hit. For example, to failure give to you a experience and we learn about this experience. Initially, what do we learn about our fall that will help us to find out what do we want in our life. Also, we need to decide what do we doing, if we give up and loos our enthusiasm or stand up and continues until we reach the hit. Then, failure is not always a bad thing pass in your life sometime we need failures in life to find out our ways to where we want to be.

In summary, success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because the enthusiasm is a good reason to stay in what do you doing and never give up when the failure come. Another reason is we learn of the failure and that help to decide in what we want to do in our life. Also, most of the people want to be in the hit and no is only won no to be in the hit also need some failure for learn about the experience that the fall give us. For this reason I'm agree with Churchill""s statement and is our decision to loss the enthusiasm or stay with the same enthusiasm that we has before of the failure.

172F67E7FBBC,"Dear, principal i think that you should not make students do community service to students that don't like doing it. First i want you to know that is a good thing that you thing of that but if students don't want to help and you sent them do something i think they are going to make it worst. EX: you sent them to go pick up trash and they go and they are just playing around they are going to be fighting with the trash throwing it where it was clean then later when they finish playing they are going to see a mess that they are going to get lazy and just walk away and go to another place where its cleaner and if they are trouble makers they are going to do that over and over again.

Think about it if you let students that really want to help out and they do the same thing (throw the trash to each other) and if they really want to help out they are going to clean for them selves. and they are going to be helping because they want to ,not because you forced them to do community service.

I was also thinking of you giving 2 choices

1*students should do community service

2*students get to do extra home work for their hardest classes(where they are almost flunking the class)................ come on unlist think about it.

By doing this 3 year program, you can start college early. In today's society, finishing school early may be a big benefit. If I had the chance to do this program, I would take that chance. You may be looked at different but in a good way. Also, by starting college early it can be a huge advantage to your future.

Finishing school early can bring you into the work force. I would believe by finishing school early, it can be a huge benefit for looking for new jobs. Also, putting on your resume that you graduated early, the employers would look into it and see that you had to take summer and evening classes. You would look your very intelligent and responsible.

If having a year off, and don't know what to do, you can explore. If I had that year off I would use the time to see new things, things that i've never seen before. By taking the year off, you would still be on track in your schooling. In life some people don't want to go into school because it is overwhelming. Have the time to go out, if not then you'll regret not having that time to yourself.

By taking a 3 year course of high school, you can start looking into jobs, have time to explore, and you can start college early. Some say that finishing high school early, you don't get the same high school experience as others that don't do the 3 year program.

My uncle was detected with a hole in his heart since he was born. But my family couldn't afford the money for the surgery, so they left him like that itself. He started feeling more pain when he studying his final years of high school. When he went through the surgery, he had exams going on. Despite the pain, he studied for his exam and passed in flying colors. Many people cannot afford the surgeries for not only heart but for many organs in their body. So, I wanted to change that and help all the people in the world, so that they can live happily at least once in their lifetime.

It is one of the high-paying jobs in the world. My family was not able to treat my uncle because of not having enough money at that time, so I wanted to earn money and save lives at the same time as much as I could. In this way, every body in my family will not be able to endure all the pain they had even before I was born. I will do anything to keep my family happy.

In this world, we have more doctors in other fields but not much in the cardio field. I wanted to change that because half of the world's population has hidden heart defection, they don't know still, like my uncle. This is because of less cardiologists in the world. When people go to the heart surgeons, the doctors ask more money then the usual charge as there are only a few doctors in that field. People cannot afford the money they ask and just leave their defected hearts, they continue doing their day-to-day works. If this continues, then people will die without even enjoying their whole life in this world. I wil become a heart surgeon and charge my patients the money they can afford. With this I will also be happy and the people who come to me will also be happy as they get cured.

In conclusion, becoming a cardiologist is one of big dreams I want to achieve in my life. I will save people's lives only by costing them with affordable money. I won't let my fellow people go through what my uncle did, so I would do anything to save their lives. People are dying across the world because there are only a few doctors in that field and they also charge them high, so I will change these people's lives by doing the opposite of what the other doctors did. I want to change this world into a better place to live because everything here is money, so i hope i can change it.

19D55405175F,"Imagination and knowledge are very inportant parts of us. Albert Eistein said,""

Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I'm on debate on whether I agree or not, so maybe this will help me decide. In my opinion, I believe that imagination and knowledge go hand and hand. There's many reasons on why I believe this, but due to the character limitation, I'm only going to name a few reasons.

One of the first reasons I believe this is because of discovery. When someone goes out on a new adventure, they can only imagine on what they can find. When they do find something new, they use their imagination to find out what it can do, what it haas inside, or what does it do for the enviroment. Once they do figure out somethinng about it, they get the knowledge from it. It's honsetly cool on how much we know because of our imagination.

Another reason on why I believe this way is because of what we created over the past years. We've created so many wonderful things and a few mistakes over the past years. When sommeone wants to invents something, they use their imagination and knowledge of the world around them to make it. If you want a job on where creativity has no boundries, then you should become either an animator or a game developer. I choose to be both, but mostly being game developer. When someone get inspired to make someone, they use the knowledge of their inspiration and their own imagination to create something wonderful or a mistake that should never been released on this world. I honestly do that too. I've takeen the knowledge from the games and animations I liked to come up with something in which I hope many people will injoy.

There's plenty more reasons that I can't really come up with but I'm sure that you get my point.

Imagination and knowledge work together to improve this world as we know it. Prime examples of this are discovery and creativity. If everyone can use these two things together, I'm sure that we'll come up with something wonderful or something that'll most likely mess up the planet forever.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0
1B4C8AD95EB5,"""Unless you do something beyond what you have already mastered you will never grow up.""

I actually agree with this, because some people are just stuck with what they do , and they don't want to try new things; they are just so used to what they have been doing for years, so they are kind of afraid of doing something new. It's just like making new friends in school. Kids are really used to their friends that they rarely talk to new students. This might apply to Ralph's words because some people don't really want to change their routine, or because they dont really wanna change their life style at all.

Another example but a little more personal would be me, I love riding my bike, I feel like I could ride it for hours without getting tired, I tried to do skateboarding for a couple months but I ended up going back to ride my bike, because I was already used to be riding my bike so I stopped trying to learn how to do skateboard.

I would say that it's like a feeling of being afraid because we think about it, we think about it's pros and cons and we also try to adjust our schedules to see if we have time to do something that's not in our routine already or if we can just replace it for something that we already know how to do. I feel that to succeed in life we have too be willing to try and or to do things that are new for us like a new type of sports, a new hobby, even a career as long as we are interested on them.

Where I'm from Eni Ayuwoki means ""do and get stronger"" back there people use to believe that if you do more than one thing that is helpful not only for you, but for everybody in your community you would be the most important and recognized person in the area.

So in conclusion for me that makes sense because I dont really enjoy having the same routine every single day, I like to switch between activities to keep my mood up. I don't think anybody likes to do the same thing over and over again.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0

Being motivated to become what they dont want to be and what you dont have the passion for. Therefore i disagree with Emersons statement; Why? Becacause i believe everyone has a choice to choose what they are passionate about, not what the society or the influenece of their parent saying I see a doctor or an engineer in you. Having the love for a profession or a study is one of the greatest thing ,you feel like you are living everytime you figure something out,you feel happy and motivated to take it futher to you reach the top. When someone is passionate about a profession,studing of a language,writting,discovering,healing,helping people,anything in this world i believe they should be motivated. Not brought down by making them do something else because its not healthy physically or mentally i believe. An example is ME.I have studied business almost my whole like since i was in my country,beause i wanted to be work in any field of business. Last year i moved to the united state and my parent and everyone around me said i should be a nurse,but i dont have the passion for nursing,but with no support on my side i decided to be nurse,and mentally i feel like ita going to be difficult, and i always bring my slef down when i thing about it, but if it was something i had the passion for i wouldnt mind the hardness i will just concentrate on how i will make it and and believe in myself that i will surly get and will also be very determined. Thata what i mean by being motivated and supported to do what you want and do what you love is really great.

So i disagree with this quote,some people will agree because they believe your society or your surrounding makes you who you are. But i believe the society and everyone around do not make you,or can not stop you or influene you to do the opposite of what you want to do unless you give them the chance like me or you take your stand and let them know why you want and love this thing and it will be a great honor if you accomplished it .

If a day came when people would have to give up all their technological advantages, life would be a catastrophe. People would not be able to get to work, there would be no way to talk to friends or family that are far away, the whole teaching system would have to be rebuilt, and many other countless horrible things would occur if technology where to be taken away from the people. We are highly dependent on technology, and that is not a negative thing. People have learned to live with it, and it makes life much easier than before the technology era started.

Easy and fast communication is one of the most important contributions that technology has provided to the new world. People's phones, computers, and even TV's now can connect everyone to loved ones. Human contact, is now even easier than it was before technology came into play. Now people can call a friend, and talk with them for hours, no matter the distance. People can text with family and friends, and it is even possible to constantly check on them with video calls. Before technology, people would have to travel many miles to come into contact with friends and family, but now thanks to technology everything has changed. Now, looking at family and friends through a little screen is a possibility, and not just something that happens in a futuristic TV show. People can tell close ones how their day is going, what has been going on in life, and every other small detail that could possibly pop into ones head. Losing human contact because of technology is not something to be worried about. Technology does not get rid of human contact. What it actually does is create the contact. It makes it possible to build bonds with people no matter the distance, and it also allows people to connect with loved ones when ever wanted.

Technology is also a very important part of current entertainment. Netflix, Apple Music, YouTube and many other apps keep people entertained for hours non-stop. Watching movies and listening to music, was something that used to be only done at concerts and at movie theaters. Thanks to the positive effects of technology, now a day enjoying good music, and movies is something that can be done at home. The best thing of these apps is the low prices, and thousands of content, which is updated over and over again constantly. Having easy access to good music and good movies while laying in the comfort of home is an activity which most people in the world would enjoy. These apps also make it possible for people with no connections to the world of entertainment to pursue a career that will be enjoyable. YouTube is one of the leading online video streamers in the world. People who want to pursue a career in entertainment have the opportunity to post their videos online and gain fans. This is something which would have been impossible before the technology era.

People love completing tasks while comfortably laying in bed inside home. Technology is so amazing, that it has made this possible to. People need to shop, but sometimes the stores which have the items that are needed are not close to their homes. Technology knows this, and it has made it possible to go to thousands of sites online and purchase anything. It is possible to buy shoes, clothing, electronics, and even food. When people shop in a normal retail store, it is possible to find sales and the items needed, but shopping online is a totally different experience. By shopping online it is much more likely to find the best possible price for an item, due to all the options that are available. There are also many items which are available for purchase online, but not available at stores. Shopping online is also surprisingly a very entertaining experience. Browsing thousands of items, and ultimately finding the best price is an activity which can keep people entertained for plenty of time. Shopping online is much easier, and comfortable than actually going to the stores to find the items that are needed.

Technology is a constant growing phenomenon, which needs to be constantly worked on. It is the fuel that powers the world. If it were to run out, everything would stop moving. With the technological discoveries that are being made every day, people are living longer lives, the depths of the world are being discovered, and new ways to sustain earth are being presented. If the way technology is growing continues at the pace it is currently going at, the world might find ways to cope with global warming, and maybe even find the cure to deadly diseases like cancer. This is how important technology is to the world. It goes to the point that if it is studied correctly it can save peoples lives, and even the world. Technology has already changed the world forever, and it will be no time at all for another invention to change the world once again. These changes will be for the good, and technology will prove to positively change the world once again.",4.5,4.0,5.0,4.5,4.5,4.5
1D47271C213D,"The students must be self- confident in order to succeed. I agree that hard work helps to build self-esteems because students must have faith in their own abilities, they have to learn from their mistakes, and be proud of them achievements. That's why students can not be conform with insufficient work just to be admired by teachers or parents. Also, to able to be successful always needs high standards.

Even though, parents and teachers decide to praise the students by giving them gifts or other things. It can motivate the students but there is some days were people are not in a good mood and forget to praised the students. That's how students can't continue with the same motivation and loose confidence. For example, my Probability Statistics math class she used to gave us candy every single day so we never try to do our classwork, everybody failed her class.

Several students make mistakes while they are trying to accomplishing something and they give up when they don't have an easy solution. In reality that is when they are used to be treated with extreme indulgence. Of course, it doesn't matter how many mistake they make; it matters to continue believing in them self. Eventually, my friend Generic_Name came from Generic_City, she used to go to

Susbury University it was difficult for her to learn English she also failed three classes. But she did not care how many times she failed. She believe in herself and she achieved her goal now she is an ESL teacher.

How does people becomes doctors or professionals? some people don't have their parents alive or they are far away from each other so they don't have nobody to praised them. From my opinion, they should be proud of them self. All the effort, dedication, passion for the school and they don't need somebody to award them to be trust. But also, it's not easy for the students to succeed in this world unless they want to work for it. Everybody can notice when they gain something beneficial for their life and be satisfied with them great effort. From my own experience, my biology teacher it was very strict that she screamed at my face the first day of the semester but I showed her that I'm better what she thought I was. So I passed her class with an average of 80 and I also passed the SOL.

Finally, when the students are comfortable from what they already accomplished, it's when they have a great opportunity to build them self-esteems. They do not need to be pushed with emotional things to able to be confident, If they get emotional later on, they wouldn't be able to continue without being praised. Some people do not survive when they don't get to achieved, then they complain on someone who don't give presents. Self-esteems always comes from achievements never comes from praising.

1D944BF5BE87,"Yes I think it is a good idea for students to plan their career early because students can be prepared for the real world, it can help with jobs, and it could help them in college. When students graduate they will face challenges . They have to find a job to support their needs. Students will also need to find what they want to do in life to make them be successful. A planned career really gives a head start to those who want to achieve more and be prepared.

The real world is tough if you dont have a plan because it can be too late to accomplish goals. Planning at a young age gives students advantages for their work. This also helps with a students resume if they want to attend college.

Jobs want students who are successful and take work seriously. When a student graduates they want to make it in life and not struggle.

Another reason students should plan early is for jobs. A job gets people money and they can use this for more school or for other needs. A planned job at a young age is a very good head start for many reasons. Students can save up for college or by a vehicle. An early job gives them a lot of experience and helps benefit when they look for more places to work outside of school.

More reasons students should plan their careers early is for college. College helps keep them in school giving more education. More education and knowledge also helps students get better jobs. Getting better jobs helps students make more money for their future. The money helps support their needs for example like owning a house.

Some people today dont want to go to college which does not mean they wont be successful. Sometimes students prefer to find better jobs to make a living without anymore education. When students dont plan ahead that also does not mean they are always too late for anything. Students would sometimes need more time to figure want they want to do in life. As long someone works hard they can accomplish all their goals and commit to a career at a young age.",4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0

Elective classes are really easy. Students will have less stress about worrying that they will fail to meet the requirement to pass their school. when the class become an elective class there will be less home work this will allow students to get an easy credit to pass the class. if this was an requirement class it would be more hard and if the students don't pass the class they will have to repeat it.

Students that are not good at music, drama and art will try their best to pass. but if they fail that means they have to do it over again until they pass it. But as an elective class student don't have to be good in it to pass. But even so the student don't like the classes but they still try to go for the free extra credit.

Requirement classes is a class that students have to take in order to graduate but most of the of the student don't want to take it. Elective classes are suitable for those students because the student that did not want to take it can switch to another class that they are good at. Student that did not want to take the requirement class will skip and don't care about it. Elective class are the best they are not hard as an requirement. Requirement class is all about passing but elective classes are fun learning and less stress to put on for the student.

1F217579A773,"Imagine if you go to school for more than eight hours? When I was in my country we were going to school at twelve and we were dismiss at five afternoon. I disagree that school should be more than eight hours because teachers can not manage their time, all staff will get tired, and some student have to take care of their family.

Teachers can not manage their time. For example, my math teacher Generic_Name he has another job he won't be able to manage his time between teaching the student and the other job. On the other hand, most teachers have kids and they send kids to baby care and they pay money. For example, my science teacher Generic_Name she was not able to stay after school because she has kids. Imagine you have make up work that needs to be done but your teacher is busy?

All staff will get tired. Imagine teachers, students, and people who in the cafeteria how they get tired if we make this decision? For example, I feel bad about the people who clean the cafeteria each day. All teachers will have hard time to explain to the student. For instance, I have my cousin he lives in Turkey. Their classes is about two hours and half. My cousin told me I have hard time to understand the teacher on the end of the class because he get tired.

Some Student have to take care about their family. For example, When I came from Iraq my mother had heart problem so I have to take care of her each day. My mother she was not able to cook and stand I was responsible to do that. However, when I was in my country I was responsible about my nephews as well.

Some say extending school hours is hopeful for student. They are wrong because some student don't like school so they will drop out. Some say student will have finish the school early. They are wrong student will be rushing and not able to get the lesson from first time.

Why it is important to work by your self? What are the beneficial? Think about it; Work by your self is better than work with a group for many reasons. Work on your own is more beneficial than work with a group learn more, more attention and good grades.

Generic_Name was a student that likes to go to school, he woke up every morning like a normal student does, but the thing is that Generic_Name do not likes is work on his own he prefer work in a group and not by its self because he likes to distract others by talking, playing,be in his phone instead on what he needs to focus on. The time keeps going and going. One day a wise person said

"" The time keeps going and going and wait for no body.''

There was another guy called Generic_Name. Generic_Name against work as a group because he knows that is a distraction and he don not likes to have bad grades. Generic_Name made a scientific experiment his experiment is based on the idea of work in a group or work alone. He talk with his teacher and explain his idea, the teacher agree with Generic_Name's idea. The teacher gives a worksheet to the student that were in the class and the teacher said you may work on your own or in a group.

The result was like Generic_Name thoughts were like, the students who work by them selves demonstrate good work, perfect scores and they did not took long time to finish the work and they were able to help others students. But the other group of students who choose work as group they show something different than the other students that work by them selves, they did not finish the work, others not even start the work between those groups was Generic_Name.

One day Generic_Name met Generic_Name at his house to play a video game. Generic_Name went to Generic_Name house and they start playing the game, while they are playing Generic_Name start ask a lot of question between those question he ask. Why you always work by your self? and not work in a group?

he laugh and answer the questions. I prefer work by my self because I easily distract with my friends, or I start talking with them and I do not finish any of my work. Generic_Name said something especial to Generic_Name. Understand this Generic_Name, work by your self is not the bad you learn, you prepare more your self, more instead of coping someones work. Think abut when a test, quiz, or an Sol comes up. Nobody will there to help you out and you do not know what to do. Please do not take mad at me I just want to help you, Generic_Name said don not worry, I appreciate the word that you said to me.

Generic_Name think over night the words that Generic_Name told him while they were playing, at the next day Generic_Name try to do what Generic_Name does and he found a big surprise that he can do a better job by its self, and time was passing and Generic_Name notice that his grades went up, have more time in home his teacher was surprise on the huge change that

Generic_Name had.

2286BCFF86EB,"Generic_Name was sitting in the cafeteria listening to music refusing to touch her plate of food, why was she like that?

Well, she was worried that everyone had their specific career picked out before going to high school and she was the only one that didn't. Students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because students will feel pressured at a young age and students will change their career options as they take different courses.

First, students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because they will feel pressured at a young age. For example, my friend Generic_Name wanted to become an astronomer but her parents wanted her to be an engineer, she felt pressured and didn't know what courses to take. During class time Generic_Name's teacher gave everyone in the class a paper to write the possible classes they wanted to take their first year of high school, but unfortunately Generic_Name didn't know what classes to take. While Generic_Name was still thinking her teacher approached to her and told her that both science and math courses connected to the careers she was debating to become, she also told her that after taking those classes she was gonna be able to pick the class she favored the most and go for that one. Some people believe that committing to a career at a young age will help students develop and make them smarter but they are incorrect because committing at a young age will cause students to have a lot of stress and give them less opportunities to join other classes.

Second, students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because students will change their career options as they take different courses. For example, Generic_Name was looking forward to become a professional soccer player but he knew he had a 20% chance of becoming one. One day during class time Generic_Name started to think about a serious career that he can actually accomplish and put extra time and work. He decided to become a history teacher; He enjoyed learning history so much that he thought about becoming the one to teach others history as well. Generic_Name was so pleased with his choice that he payed close attention on everything Generic_Name said and never hesitated to raise his hand and ask for more questions. Generic_Name took all the history classes he needed to take, he also joined debate class and a public speaking class therefore he would become better at public speaking and not be afraid to talk in front of others. A month later Generic_Name thought about how good he'll be if he became an attorney. Generic_Name definitely knew how to speak in front of others after taking the public speaking class and he also knew how to defend a case so he changed his career option and decided to stick with attorney.

Another example is that Generic_Name wanted to be a dog sitter but she was also interesting in the study of the human body and how it worked, so she decided to join a a psychology class and learn more about it.

In conclusion, students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because they will get a chance to pick the career they want as they take different courses in high school and it will also cause many students to feel pressured at such a young age. Students should know that they have all the time they need to learn and be curious about any class they put their interest into, as they grow up their brain will develop therefore they will become more smarter and they will have the chance to pick the career to want to be in.

Some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours. Yes the school should follow the model by extending the school day two hours. It will save money for the schools. Students can have more time with teachers. Students can have a time to work at a job. Teachers get to have more time grading.

It will save money for schools. The reason I said that is because the transportations cost money and in four-days the school can save transportation money rather then five-days a week. The school can also save money on electricity on a four-days school week. Schools can save the money to help students to pay for their colleges. Schools can save the food to give it to homeless people.

Student have more time with teachers. Students can have more then 90 munites in class since is two hours extended. They get to have more time with teachers. They gonna learn more in class with more time added. They can really be organize, since they have four-day school and more time with teachers. That can help them learn about life even more.

Student can have a time to work at a job. I said that because most of the time when we have five days school. we can't work because we scared to fail our grade. if there is four days school and more time with teachers we can keep a good grade. And we can work two day and leave one day for study and family, since their's gonna be three days off.

Teachers get to have more time with grading. Their's alots of grading that teachers do so with three days off it can really help them with grading. Teachers can have enough to time to teach the class. They can have time to see every each student about their grade and see if they need help with any class works. It is great because teachers can have time with students and that's very important.

It is the best to follow the four-day school and extend two hours of the school day. It helps school with saving money. Student can have more time with teachers.

24DAF94F0A18,"I am sure my heart is raising that I saw a lot of people behavior is going bazaar! Then it is said that your own behavior is the best way to influence other people because it creates trust, shows that your helping others, and creates a positive big impact on others.

Your own behavior creates trust is to show that other can respect you and care about you. Friends behavior creates trust because they will sometimes help others. For example, if i have a huge injury and I can't walk, then probably they'll know that I'm not joking around and I'll trust them to help me. Another person behavior that creates trust is teachers, their behavior is mostly positive and always influence others. They'll always care about helping their student and makes the student trust the teacher what they need help on. Even though students think that teacher dont trust them, but others think teachers have faith on others to try hard to help and let them work hard for the future. Also, families creates trust so they will always have influence on me. It like i made their personality more positive than before. Your own behavior creates trust because of helping others, having positive personality, and increase better relationship on others.

Showing that you help others is another way to influence other people from your own behavior. Sometimes my families help others and they will never forget about us. Like all of our family went to Generic_City and went on a mission to help others, like we build houses or feed a lot of poor people with food that we made. Another person that help others is friends, they always help me if i'm in a stress zone. They always comfort me feel better when I'm upset or mad. Also, teachers help other because they want the students to past the school. Although some of them might fail, yet teachers try their best to let them past. They want them to try hard so teachers need to make them work hard and help them learn. Like my teachers will try their best to help me past my quizzes or test. Helping others is the best way to influence people like friends, teachers, and families that they will support you and others what they need.

The reason why your own behavior creates a big positive impact of others. So more and more people will show respect and will mostly love you. This will create a big positive impact on friends because I show love for them and they will probably love me back. All of us should always show love and care so that they wont hate you. For families, they always have a positive impact because of others positive attitude. Showing a good attitude can be like walking the bridge to their heart. This can help their feeling be better and better. Another person that have a big impact on others is firefighters. They always care about others and their lives so they always protect them when they're in trouble. There was one story that these firefighters that they need equipment because their tools is rusty and broken, but one person called them for help so they came the house was on fire and the wife is still trapped. So they got her out and she is save. So the husband so so proud, and send them 2,000 dollars a month so the firefighter can bye the equipment. This it to show how much the husband care about them. So this can create a big positive impact because of showing love, fixing feelings, and having risk to protect.

Other might say that your own behavior can affect others. It has said that you own be behavior can influence other by showing that you help others create a positive big impact, and creates trust.

Students should attend online courses because bullying would decrease nand it would be easier to find your way through the website instead of walking from class to class.

Bullying would have a major decrease because students would be at home instead of school. Everyday students get harassed by other students and then up to the point where it drives them to commit suicide. Students would be at their house where it's safe and less distracting.

First students should decide on what activities they will be interested in because parents or guardians can support their children. Students will be absolutely be proud of their families by supporting them to do what they like, for example like sports. Teenagers are interested in activities because they like their own sports or the whole family likes sports.

Teenagers also love when parents or guardians support them because they can have persuasive thoughts about the extracurricular activities.

Finding their talents is an entertaining expression because people around the world can be amazed at how teenagers can be so good at extracurricular activities.

Third students should decide on what activities they will be interested in because they can get awesome scholarships or grades. Students can get scholarships by showing how much their activities mean to them. Teenagers get much better scores on their grades because they can be able to focus and stay healthy. It can be helpful for their college, their future, and their family status. Their coaches will be really proud of them by getting scholarships from different countries. Getting amazing grades and scholarships is the legendary epic passionate feeling that students will never forget in their lives.

Another point of view is many students do not like the school to control their activities. However, many people believe that school should have total control regarding extracurricular involvement of students after school because that think that school staff knows better and that they can guide students to get involve into more productive activities. Which would eventually result into a more bright and smart teens who would feel more comfortable to face the real world.

In conclusion deciding on the extracurricular activities they will be interested in will benefit their scholarships or grades, their families will support their children, and the students will find their true talents. So teenagers can become the 10 out of 10 in their best of the extracurricular activities. Also students can now decide and control their own extracurricular activities being able to become a legendary, passionate, euphoric, having awesome persuasive thoughts, and epic person.

Why is importan taht students to choose a career to young age? Although some say it is good idea for students to commit to a career to young age because the students can to learn more, actualiy it is a bad idea for students to commit to a career to young age because the students don't have time for explore new things and they don't have time for fun in the high school.

Some person belive that is is a good idea for students to commit a career to young age. One reason is because the students can to learn more in a specifit environment.

For example, the students who choice a career by time they enter high school. They have a idea about the class they want to take. For this reason, when they finish high school they are more prepared. A 35% the students choose a career to youn age because they think it is help for your future.

However, it is bad idea for students to commit a career to young age because they don't have the opportunity to explore new things. For example, in the high school the students have the opportunity to choose 2 or 3 elective class. this clas to help the student to find or explore a new hobby,and some time this class to help to discover what do yuo like or what do you want in the future. In my opinion, I think that this class are good for the students who not have a idea what they want to study in the future. For example, I want to learn to play guitar and I take the music class, but I discover I am so bad in this type of class. My second year I take a math class and I discover taht I love math and I think that I want to continue to learn about this class.

The other reason is it is bad idea for students to commit a career to young age because the student don't have time for fun. One reason is that students is only focus his study and they don't pay atention her and his friends. they are worry because they have -B in your class or they don't make the homework. In my pinion, It is good that they are worry for your grade, but they need time to fun because tha teacher and old people think taht is good that students take a breack (rest landing) some times. In my experince, I heva alot of memory with my friends for this reason I recommend all students pay atention your frinds and create a lot of memory like me. But no forget the school and the most importan your family.

In conclution, it is bad idea for students to commit a career to young age because they need to consider what they want to study in the future. In my experience, is most better to take time to fun with frinds, your family and take time think about what do you do in your future.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5

The reason why a lot of people agree with me in this subject, is because lot of people that have a negative attitude or minset, their thoughs or ideas would always be negative. All those people would never be sucess in life, because no matter what they would like to do in life or the ideas they have in their head that they wanna do in life. All thoose people would always have that negative spot in their head, that would not let them success in life, all those people would have to work two times harder to make it to the end, to make their dreams come true and sucess in life. Out of 100% of pople that have a negative attitude or minset, only 10% would sucess in life, the other 90% would not be able to sucess in life.

The people that have a positive attitude in life, all those people would success in life, because everything would be easy for them, because no matter how hard the situation gets, they always gone think that they can do it. They always have the minset of we would get throught this and we gone do it and can do it. nothing would stop them from making their dreams come true. They would not let anything get into their heads, that is why for all those people is easy to make it unitl the end, to make their dreams come true and be successful in life, because all those people know what they wanna do in their life and because they want the best for them and to give their family the best in the future.

The people with their mind set positiveand 100% sure of what they wanna do with thei life, their reasons can be because they want a better life for them, wanna help other people and been an example for other people, like guys or girls that are about to gradute high school that they would start seeing what the real wolrd world is, they wanna give their families a better future. They wanna be a good example for their kids, they wanna show their kids that no matter how hard life gets, they do not need to give up or have a bad attitude in life, because that would not help them to be successful in life, that they need to stay positive no matter what and always keep their attitude and minset postitive, that if they stay positive, they would success in life and would make all their dreams come true.

279245CFCCF4,"An Old Proverb Says Honesty Is The Best Policy

I agree about being honest at all times. Because thats how I was taught and even though I get in trouble, when Im honest it's better than lying. Because lying can get you in to worst trouble. If your always honest people can always trust you and who doesn't want to be trusted? My grandma always told me that when you do something bad or lie karma is going to bite you hard. But, sometimes your going to have to lie for an important reason like hurting someones feelings, I think its a horrible feeling to hurt someones feelings am I right?

However when your honest people will always respect you, like you, and honer you. For an example this has happened to me if your at school and your at lunch and everyone is supposed to be quiet and you and your friend start talking, a teacher calls both of you over and she said,""were you guys talking"" my friend said no and I said yes I was talking , and the teacher said, ""thank you for being honest you can go back and finish your lunch"" but, my friend got in trouble.

27E725D251A8,"Do you think people aways succeed without any challenge in their life?.

Author Ralph Waldo Emerson is right.

Some people sometimes decide to isolate because they cannot handle the pressure of this world being a human is not easy becasue sometimes you just feel that the comments that the people make about you are real, but everybody should be strong and be themselves,because we as humans we can do anything that we want to achieve our goals and never pay attention to those comments because we can show them who we really are.

Firts, desire a lot of people when they see someone that is doing great on their life, sometimes people don't like it, others ones start thinking on doing it becuase they know the this man/woman are there because they work hard, in this world nothing is easy to have unless you work so hard to get it but never try to be soemeone else and is not necessary to do things that you don't like because you are trying to be like one else not do the mistake the most important thing is that you are going to show to those people that did not believe in you that nothing is impossible even when this world if full of envy.

Second, confidence now people around the world what they see in a person is their appearance,clothes, shoes, etc, now people are like trying to be something that they are not to try to fit in this fake world, but you know there is where you realize that is wrong to be honest things don't matter what really matter is who you are you and what can you offer to this world that is trying to kick you out, but you start getting confidence and that is a big challenge to try be youse around people that don't see life the way you see it.

Third, success as the world give you hard times you start to be strong, sometimes you have to go through things ` that you start to think about giving up, but you quickly think that you are wrong that you are going to make it even if is impossible like the author says ""To be you yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplsiments.""

Some people have lose their confidence becuase they are trying to be something that they're not, people think that being fake is the best way to fit, i don't think like them i think that you should you be who you really are.

In a world where you have to fight to be yourself and don't get lost in the fantasy that the world offers you that is the greastest accomplisment. A lot of people might argue that is not true, but they are all wrong because people always can be themselve if they wants even is the world if full of lies is their responsability to make real their dreams.

In the future i will try to tell the people that nothing is imposible, to not be afraid of who they are that each person if different in that is what make us special.

In this life you just have to be youlself enjoy every moment because after you get old you will regret everything that you didn't because you just were to be busy trying to be someone you are not.

To conclude, life sometimes gives you the opportunity to discover who you really are and know what is what you wants.",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5

293A93F037A7,"I agree with Winston Churchhill because without failure how can we be succesfull in life. Frist, reason why because If you fail at something you can reflect on it. Second, failure can make you become better then you were yesterday if you work hard. Third, Is never let failure consume you. Instead use failure to lead you to success.

You can always reflect on somthing you fail at, and become better. If, you don't study yourself at something you failed at, then you can't become successfull. For example, say you were playing a football game, and you missed your tackle in the game. After the game you watch the film, and see what mistakes you did wrong. After you seen what was wrong in film. You studied the film, and trian harder in practice for next game, so that won't happen again. Another reason you can do after you reflect on yourslef is practicing at something you love to do. For example, riding a bike for the frist time without trianing wheels. If you fail at riding a bike, then you have to practice, so you can become better at it. In order to practice you have to reflect on it frist. After you reflect what you did wrong, then you will become better when you practice.

Failure can teach you to become better then you were yesterday if you work hard. For example, you went to practice for a 100 meter, but you did not wram up at all. You decided to run the 100 meter for the frist time anyway. After you finsh the 100 meter you didn't feel good about the time you had. The next day you decide to warm up, and work harder to get better results. After your trianing you wanted to run a 100 meter. When you ran a 100 meter you felt better with your time, and decided to work harder everyday to become better then you were yesterday. This is how failure is making you better because it is teaching you that if you fail at something, you can always pick it back up, and become better, then what you were doing that day when you failed at something. If you want to become better, then you were yesterday. Then don't worry about the past because thinking about it all the time will bring you back to failure. For example, say you are mad that you lost your 100 meter race in fourth place. When you lost, you keep thinking about it all the time, and can't move forward for the next race. When the next race starts the day after you lost. You lost the race again in fourth place because you keep thinking about the race you lost in the past, then thinking about how can you can become better then you were yesterday. The point is in order to become better you have to think how can you improve better for the future, then thinking about how you failed in the past.

Never let failure consume you. Instead use failure to lead you to success. For example, say you have a math test on Monday, but you decide on Sunday to not study for it because you think the test is very easy. On Monday you give up on a math test, and decide to fail it. The reason why because you did not study, and it was too hard for you. You decide to retake it on tuesday, and learn from your mistakes. On Tuesday after you failed the math test. You took the test again to get a better score because you studied very hard to succesed in the test. This is why you always use failure to lead you to success. If you let failure consume you, then you won't reach to the top to become successful. For example, you can't swim at all, and your drowing. For some reason you dont won't to reach the top because you are depressed, and want to give up.

In conclusion, I still believe It is impossible to be succesfull without failure. Without failure we cannot reach the top to be successful. Without failure we cannot reflect on things to become better. Without failure we cannot become better then yesterday. In order to become successful we have to use failure to lead us to success. Its okay to fail because after you learn from it. Everything is going to be okay when you overcome it, and be better. ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.5

Have you ever heard people saying ""i want to go to the movies but i have go to the store."" I bet there is people out there. they like to go out, but they have so much to do that they can't and is not a problem because we have technology that can help us with stuff that we need without going to the store or deal with people humors. also, you can save time to use it in another activities like you can go and have fun with the family or friends. however there's people that they're against technology, and everyone has they opinion about it. Unfortunately we still have technology that we can use it.

There's people who like to use technology because it's a new way to see the world. they can get so much done using technology like they can create new things like: new cars, new smart-phones, new styles of clothing, and so much more like it's unique way to see what can technology do for us without taking us so much time. But they are people who still think that doing stuff in the old way is the same, i mean everyone has the own description of things. personally i think without technology will take us so much to make new stuff so unfortenely technology we get done some amazing things.

297ABDDBAA92,"How is possible to people think that success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I agree with ministre Winston; it always would be a new oportunitie to change the mistake people learn from failure. It gives everyone a chance to corret it. I also believe that failure is an important part in life to people must have success.

One notable reason is that people learn from failure. For example, sometimes people get involved in some sadness problems that consist in failure. People have the oportunitie to corret it; they would be able to reach their dreams or goals not matter how harder is life people always have to strive with enthusiasm. Moreover, in my personal opinon, 3 years ago I was playing for a soccer team I get involved in a situation where I got really stressful with myself because I training hard for playing the final game with my team. Unfortunately, I can't play the final game because the game before I commited a foul and I get a red card. my team loss the game, it was too lake for me do anything about it. I realized that not matter what I did in the past; it always be a new oportunitie for improve and teach myself that failure it's has an important role in life to be success.

Futhermore, another important reason is that it gives people a better chance to corret it. This reminds me to a friend, who was in a situation where he was really disappoint because he fail his driving test. The next day, he cames to my house and talk to me about it. I remember that I told him to keep in his mind that it's important to be prepare for any situation that you know you have a lot of chances to pass if you triying and triying you will get on it. A lack of success depending in achieving goals and dreams. I think that failure is also a way to teach people that even if you fail you just always have to try no matter how many times you try it as long as you trying without lossing the enthusiasm you will reach your dreams, or goals.

Some people would argue that success is not consist in failure; however, everyone in our society knows that failure is an important part in life to be success. People learn from failure and it gives people a better chance to corret it. There is not limits to reach ours dreams as long as you keep going to complete it.

Provides everyone a learning that not martter how harder is life, there would be millions of chances to be success with anything you want to do.

29B364A33B4E,"""Unless you try to do something beyong what you have already mastered,you will never grow""

I think this is wrong becuase if you commit a mistake and you want to fix you cant due no matter what happen you always have a second change to grow.

Firts,Im explain my topic whith details a person who is due something for class always need help for others student's for example: All the students have differents opinions,but only one is the leader of the work they must be discuss the problem and star working. The people on the group don't have the same idea that the others have the work is amost finish but is not good enough,they present the work but is not good,the leader say I dont acept this work becuase is incomplete the students talk more the topic and they star working again in the problem. The people in the group never say I dont want to due this work,becuase all the people have to prove her self,they say maybe the work is not good but we can't make this again,you never have to felt that you cant not due becuase you cant grow no matter what happen you cant due again and star again.

Second,In situations you feelt that the things that you due or make are wrong ,but in not becuase the all the people in this world have a second or three changes to improve,and if you make a mistakes first is not matter that you have to made the same mistake again,you must be improve your self,world,class,and the people that you have you never have to feel grow becuase that word is not exist for a person who every day is triyng to make a good work. My other example is a person who is guilty to due a crimen and this person want to have a education to grow like a human that we are they must be giving the oportunity to study no matter what he due or make because all the people have the same staight.

I know that many people are gona to be upset with me becuase they must think, a person who make a crimen don't need a second change but for my opinion the have a second change becuase they are in jail for the crimen and the want to grow to be a better person. All the people in the world have a second change becuase if you make something that you are not prove you must be make that again you never have to say I don't want to due this or

I don't have a might to make this,that is wrong you cant due everything in this world is possible, and I know that this people are annoyance for what I think but is only my opinion becuase nobody want to be in jail and never learn somehing for your future, the people who is upset with me why they don't think if you are in the same situation you have to think in you and also the other people to make this world a little better.

In my conclusion, the people have always a second change to grow,the human that we are we have to think in us but also in the others person like example: this text is for a world to make this a better place to live, becuase all the people in this country is fortunate becuase have so many oportunities to grown and be prepare for te future in other hand I come from a country that don't have opportunities but my goal is to be a better person today, tomorrow and for my future.

Some kids would like to go outside to play with their friends or would like to play video game with online friends. Most of schools give student to much homework an schoolwork.

Schools give us to much homework and homework. Some teachers give student to much work in one class and things that we can put all of that stuff in are brain in one and a half hours. If you miss one day of school you will be hind in all your class because teacher give us to much work. Student would get bad grade if teacher give us to much work to get us behind.

Some kids love to go outside and play sport with their friend and just to have fun. Some teens and kids all most play video game everyday to play with friends and online friends and they do not like schoolwork. Kids love to go outside,teen love to play video game all day,and no one love to do schoolwork and classwork.

student hate some teacher. When teacher are mad they make the student do more classwork and homework. Some time teacher will said stuff behind you. This is why student and teacher fight because the teacher make s up lie that the student did this but they did not do it so now the student get very mad at the teacher.

This is why school board plan should not have one and a half hours to schools each day. Teacher makes up lie then the student are mad. Kids love to go outside and teen will dead for video game and not do homework. Teacher will make us do more work because they have one and a half hours. ",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0
2A96CE614119,"A famous British writer once said ""your character will be what you yourself choose it."" His name was John Lubbock. What he wanted to state is that we choose what we want to be from here on out and, that know one chooses for us. Another question that was asked was, ""is our character formed by influences beyond our control."" No we control all of our actions so what John wanted to say is that our character and character traits are based on the choices we make and still making.

We are always in control and know what we are doing on a daily bases. We always know what well happen based on the actions we take, it's common sense. It's like when you argue to a teacher we know it's bad and we know what comes after that and that is going to the principals office. Nothing is never out of our control is weather we want to stop it or just let it happen. Most of the time our actions are based on bad things like smoking for an example we know it's bad but it's in influences or the people that make us do it. So that's why we need to stop listening to that bad side and listen to our good side.

The character we are right now as a person is based on the life choices we made. If it wasn't for the good or even the bad choices we made in life we wouldn't be the person we today. Everything is bases on what we do and what we don't do. For example is we study hard enough and work hard as well we can get to the college or job of our dreams. But to do that we have to make good life choices and good decisions. Like i said before the person we are today is based on ALL the choices we made starting from when we were little to how we are right now.

We are far from perfect but we try to make the best decisions or perfect is you say. As we humans we know we are not perfect and shall never be perfect but that doesn't mean we dont try to make perfect decisions. For starters we know our rights from our wrongs. So we know our good decisions from our bad decisions and you would think that it's easy to choose the right one but in reality it's not. The more bad it is the more we want to do it. It's just human nature one well say BUT we most of the time we don't choose that side want to know why. It's because we are always in power and it's never out of our control. Some yes but most others NO.

In conclusion we know that nothings never out of our power. We know that person we are today is based on the life choices we made. That we know our rights from our wrongs, our positive and negative. And what John Lubbock wants to tell us. That our character and character traits is based on the type of person we are that is what we wanted to tell us. And its never to late to under stand that either.       ",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5

One of them is that They do not count with Transportation and they live far away, or some students that have special cases. So Today some School give you the option to teach you from School.

You must have a computer or device that allow you communicate with schools, if not, you won't be able, The only way that you can learn from home it's internet, but at the same time there are people that can buy those resources.

Study from home have pros and at the same time cons, pros are those can help you to learn the same themes that students learn at school, also you get you degree and can Apply to colleges, but, there is the case that they won't have a healthy and normal life at college.

Learn from Home is that you can finish it in the time that you want it, you can spent your time as much you want and finish it , but, what are you going to do after finish it?.

People that learn from home do not know what is converse with people around them, That is a big problem that can affect their life in future, They won't know where they at, or how talk with another person. That can be so stress, often they will feel exclude from their milieu.

Learned from home could help you to skipped school and you won't have to wake up early but, is not going to be the same that a regular student got in a normal school, why?, because a normal student can talk and ask his doubts in issue of time. They have many resources that School can give you. If you are learning from home, you won't be able to ask and resolve your doubts, you will have to search by yourself and figure it out.

We can not forget that people that have special cases, well, that people have at the same time special programs that school offers, some Schools are able to receive them and work with them at school, and other Schools can give you an option to work from your home, Those programs were designed only for people that born sick or have problems since born.

If you don't want to go to School, you must have a reasonable excuse, because you have to apply for it, you can not decided that you're not going to School because you don't wan't it, and you want to learn from home. Specially from public school that request a letter and proofs that you can not assist to school, and then They will analyze your case.

Today you have the resource to learn from home, you should think about it, don not make mistakes that can affect your life in future. At least you have a special case. There are many solutions that can help you and you can triumph.       ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5

The attitude is very important because is your behavior with the another pople, when you talking with one person he go see your attitude, if you have nice attitude he go thinking he is a nice person because he have respect and his attitude is nice and humble, and he go want to talk more with you because your attitude is good, if another day you see that person he go want talk with you again.

For example you go to talk with you father love for first time, the first thing he go see about you is your attitude, respect, and he go said he is a good man for my doughther because his attitude is good he have respeect he is a nice person he will be proudo of you for your good attitude and kindness. He will have confidence in you and respect, the attitude is important if you want respect you need learning respect to the another people and nice attitude.

When one day you have children you have to teach them to do some good people to each them good things to do people and to have a good attitude with the people is the most important thing with a good attitude your children can be good people they wiil learn how beutiful life is when they learn how to have a good attitude and respect people and you will be proud of yourself because you did a good job of giving your children a good education. the attitud it is the key of life.

Attitude is the main basis of life you have to learn to have a good attitude if you have an attitude the people around you consider a good person of values because you know how to express yourself with people and you know how to speak and have a humble attitude. Many of today's people don't have a good attitude, their attitudes are not good, they don't have respect, so people don't know how to express themselves by talking to people about any subject so be kind person who knows how to respect people regardless of age and above all your attitude always has to be humble and respecful what the people they knows how your are a good person and they go to have respect for you all the time. Respect and Attitude is the key in this life Remember these are the most important things you have to know how to use them and especially learn them that way all the children in the world have to go to school to learn and know these important things in this life the education is the most important thing for your life the attitude always has to be the most important always be a humble person above all and respectful.

2B3CB2A6D7D0,"Did you know that business that partnerships the schools helps the students to know what they want to do in life. When students go to business trip with the school

They are discovering where they want to work in the future. This allow students explore where they want to work. If they wanted to work at a place that they dream of working then they are going to explore the things where they wanted to work at. I would like to explore more real estate because

I want to flip flop houses so I want to learn more about this and I want the manager of the business pick us so we can learn how those a work.

One reason, That you should pick us is how do you know if the house is good to flip and know if you going to make more money. People think that you should look in area that are growing and get house that are bad and flip the house so you can sell it for more and get more money then you payed the house and the things that made the house better.

Second reason, the manager should pick our class so we can learn How does the business work like how many house do you need to buy so that the work proceed and process. I heard that people buy three house each 6 mouth so they can work on it because some houses take one month and other houses take 4 month. Then you got to wait for the houses to sell that can take weeks or even months to sell the house to get the money.

third reason, That the manager should pick us that we want to know that if the wait of getting the money is worth it by waiting to the house to can be ready and wait so the house can get sold. People I heard that money that you wait six mouth is worth it because the money that the person get back is like more twenty thousand more on the house that you can buy a better house in a better place or keep some money. The money that you get can make a lot.

That why the manager of the real state business should pick us to visit and learn about the work because students want to learn more about this job and have question more so in the future that students will know about more then the job and maybe in there life working in this area so they can make money to. In conclusion schools should have more partnership companies that students can visit and learn about the work and that can help the students pick there job . and that can help students know what they want to do in life and proceed there dream of working and knowing what to do.

i think that yes if they put their mind to it. And i think if they want to pass all their grades if they are doing school at home and they really want to do it then yes If they do the all their sentens well and all their paragh well.

Aslo i think that if they are home schooled that they might do the work when they want to do it some of them will not care about it and some might just forgetand outher will say they will do it latter.

Sometime the mom/dad dose not help the student but most of the time the student want to do home school and want to pass then yes it depends on the student. when any student dose school at home they will often not do the work they aslo dont learn all the things the the school teaches they learn what the mom/dad knows.

I will say i suport it but i also dont suport becuas like i said most kids dont do the work but also some do the work. most kids when they are home schooled the mom/dad send them to school becuas they dont know what elas to teach them some just do it just to get school over with and when the mom/dad send them to school they some times llike but they aslo end up droping out of school.

Most student do benift from atending class at home but if they put their mind to it and do the work some time they learn like that becuas theirs no one that bothers them they do the work at their own speed on what they know.

most student come to school when they are home school they dont know most of the things that they learning that is becuas they didn't learn much when they where atending the class at home online becuas they were offten on their phone most of the time not caring about the work, or becuas they sleep late. Some student do know more when they are home schooled some times more then what they a student that gose to public school.

but most students that are home school they some times want to go to public school they want to go beacus they want to learn more thing make frend they rather go to public school to learn more beacuas they benn doing home school for most of the school year. some time its beacuas of their mom/dad scared that some thing might happen to their kid they dont trust their kid going to public school beacuas they might do some bad thiing.

im sure that students benefitfrom home school some take colleg class at home some start their corears but taking online class at home or some just do the things/follow the step their perent.

sometime when they are home schooled they have to go to school beacuas they have family problems or beacuas they just dont like being home scholled no more beacuas they want to do more things they wan tot learn more beacuas they feel like they are not learing the thing that they are learnig at home.

The things they learn some times aint right if they are learnig it frome their mom/dad if they are not doing the class online. But i think if they are doing the online class doing what they have to do to know what they want to be in life get thru all the the online class.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0
2BE976C99FDF,"Many people like Philosopher's are stating Information which comes from there head and believe Its right; For people to look at and assume It Is right and agree because of what position that person has such as a Philosopher,Physician, and a Humanitarian. This Philosopher,Albert Schweitzer illustrates that an ""Example Is not the main thing In influencing others;It Is the only thing."" Although setting an example by your own behavior Is a good way to Influence other's; Their's still better and different way's to Influence people. Not all people have bad behaviors because of somebody close to them; A son could be a good and humble and the people around him could only have negativity.

There are different ways such as sitting down with someone and giving advice about good behavior and what their currently doing wrong In the present. Schools even teach about It and have group of students learn about whats good and bad. In health class they are teaching about having a healthy life to be prepared in life and for whats coming In the future. Although there are example's out there like famous people that motivate others to go the same path they went,Also a good example but those are not the only way's; There are teachings or parents giving advice to have a better behavior,psychologists who people can tell whats going on in their life and they get a response of what they can do.

Somebody,Anybody can demonstrate they were a good example to somebody but at the end not everybody turns out to be like them. A son can be good and humble while the people close to him or that he admires have a lot of negativity. Anybody could sit down with somebody and talk about about what there doing wrong and they could be doing the same thing;That dose not make them a good example but at least they give advice,ideas, and reveals to that person a new pathway they can take to do better. Teachers who teach about It can fill them with information they didnt know about having a healthy life; That teacher could be doing everything wrong and be negative which makes her a bad example to everybody but the students get the good advice to be better.

There are people who leave good examples for others to follow but is It also the only thing. Because there are other ways to influence other people such as giving advice and teaching, while that person who gives It Is a bad example but the person who receives It follows the good advice not there bad example.",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0
2C4DE9FD3734,"Albert Einstein once said imagination is more important than knowledge. I have three reasons why I support his statement. My fist reason is if man haven't imagined light would Thomas Edison create the light bulb? Second, is because imagination gives hope. Hope for one day to cure cancer, hope to stop world hunger, hope to have world peace.

Phones,laptops, microwaves,how do you think we got their? Its because people imagined things other people thought wasn't possible. Because they didn't have the knowledge about it. Lets take the light bulb for example. People in those days used candles,and believe me as a kid whose been in the country side, it's not the same. Thomas Edison imagined if he can create light, and he did it. Now his work led to lots of good every day things. Like tv, microwave, electronic toothbrush, laptops and so on.

I had a friend,and her dad was sick. He had cancer and they couldn't afford the medicine. Her mom was a house wife,so she didn't have a job. If it was me in that scenario I would have gave up and accepted my dads fate. Unlike me my friend started working at McDonald. Getting paid 15 dollars an hour. She worked 4 hours on the week days and 6 hours on weekends. She made enough money to pay for her dads medicine and buy food for the house. Even tho she had to work, her grades where better than mine,and every time she felt down she starts imagining what she would do with her dad after after he gets better,and that gave her hope. Hope to work even harder.

2 month later it was time for her dads surgery,but she didn't have enough money for the surgery. Thats when the entire neighborhood decided to help her. After that her dad got his surgery and got better. Now she is in high school, working hard for for a scholarship.

2D63639F997F,"Is it having a possitive attitude the key to succes in life?

If someone would ask me if a possitive attitude is the key to be succesful in life. I honesty would agree with them. Because in a big part of life everyone is going to have to deal with ups and downs, Some more than others but everyone have to go through something bad for something good to happend. everyone have to fight for what they want, and on that fight is going to be bad parts and good parts but if you stay possitive most of the time you are going to win the fight , accomplish what you were loooking for and be succesful, But if you aren't just keep trying and be possitive everytime.

Always have possitive thoughts a possitive attitude and keep trying, Get up over and over intuil you accomplish your dreams, Do not give up because if something i have learn is that if you give up and think negative, you would never be succesful and know what you are actually capleble of, Thats why a lot of people is just stock in the same place because they are scare for what is going to happen, Because they have more negative thoughts then positive ones, That's making them not be succesful in life, thinking that they are better where they are and not where they can be.

A example from my life is when life just decided to punch me in the face, just change my life. About two years ago when i was in freshmen year of high school, my doctor told me that i have a bad arteria is the vein that gives oxygen to the heart, So i had to have a heart surgery.

This is how everything started, One day I woke up got ready to go to school, went to school like usual. at the time I was in middle school, Generic_School, I was playng soccer and i have got to tired went to the bathroom I felt like something wasnt right, I drop to the ground and felt nausia, I didnt give it any atention and just kept going with my day like normal. Almost around six months later i had another mini heart attack, But at the time i didnt know what it was. I was just laying on my bed and i just started feeling a sharp pain in the chest, But it went away in about 30 minutes. when everything got serious was later on about another six months later when I was at school at the time i was almost finishing freshmen year at Generic_School, my chest started to hurt badin class, So what i did was go to sleep in class and see if it would go away, Then when i woke up the pian wasn't there anymore. I wen to my house and about 4 hours later the pain started again and it was bad so I told my mom and we went to the emergency room in the hospital. At the time i had a infection in my trought so the doctor said that it was doe to the infection, then they told me to go to a heart specialist. The apointment was on a monday my mom had decided that we wern't going to go so she call the place to cancel the appointment and they told her that it was important for me to go because it was something serious. They told us that what i had was mini heart attacks, he told us that i was going to have to get a heart surgery because there was more posibilities for me to die of a heart attck then to die during the surgery, so i didnt have any other choise more then take the chance and have the surgery done.

The whole time i was pissitive, I wasn't scare at all i didn't have bad thoughts. So the day that i was going to have my surgery finally came. The doctors read to me all the chances that i had to die if something went wrong bacuse they had to stop my heart and conect the veins t a machine so they could work on my heart, i was just calm and thinking possitive all the time with a smile on my face and having a possitive attitude. I had my surgery and everything went perfect in a week i was out of the hospital, In about three months i couln't wait any longer so i got a job start working making moneyand going to school, always possitive. And now i am makin almost

$1,100 per week and i'm just 18 years old still bought my second car crash it fix it and sold it then I bought me a 2017 Subaru WRX STI and my life is just going better and better some down and ups but getting up no matter wha, always trying and giving bad moments a smile and always possitive because things always are going to hapend but that's how life is. I dont know where i would be right now if i had a bad attitude all the time, and negative thoughts, thanks god i'm still here alive.

Algouth, people say that technology is the future of our lives. Nevertheless I think people have the reason and this bring negatives effects on people's lives, the technology is taking our comunication with other person but its true we are going foward so each day the technology its growing in to our daily lives. In this present people can check out any book they want to read, shop, and play video games without speaking with other to another person.

In the past the people could come in the librery search for a book that the person wanted to read or ask to one of the employes from the librery for help to find a book and then that person will take a seat and spend the time he want to spend in the librery reading that book, that person comunicated with someone but now in this present people don't talk to any one because of the technology. In this present you don't have to move to anywhere to read a book you can do it from your house seating in your sofa just with one clic with the computer. The technoly helop us im many ways but depends and how you are usining. I used to go to the librery and read many books but like I said before now I just read a book in my room from my tablet and I did not need to speak with any person.

Go to the shopping store and buy thing for the bathrooom, livingroom, garden, and the garage was funy in the past because you were talk with people at the store during you were serch for some items. technoly change the way how to shop because you can use your computer to shop in online even if you don't have a computer you can do it from your phone the technology change our live in many ways. Technology is taking our laughs,smile,and the opportunity to met some friend. I used to buy some food at Chipotle restaurant and I laugh when I see my working at Chipotle and that is how should have to be, not how I do now, I just use my phone to order food from the app Uber Eats and they bring my food to my door and that it.

Have fun with friends in the school,strets,and the parks it chagend thanks to the technology. This reason why technology it changed our way how to live makes me feel sad, childs in the past used to have fun with anything because technology not was to big. but that changed when parents started to buy a cell phone for thir kid thta was the most error they could do because kids doesn't have the must intelligent brain to reconize how long they spend their time in the cell phones, technology took the childhood of our kid. when I was a kid like 10 year old I used to play with my friends after school in the floor with littler cars and we inmagent that we are like pilot of faters cars it was so funy. I think our kind have to enjoy their live having fun, not spend the time with the cell phones playing games.

To conclud I thing it has limitation of human cantact due to the use of technology had negative effects on people's lives. Those negative effect could destroy our lives for just use the technoly every single minute. the comunication with others its over because the technology is taking the must time of our lives. True technology is the future of the world but keep it in main how you can use the technology and the technology don't use you.         ",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
2DDFC0DFC442,"Highschool is a big step in the growth of students. The step from middle school to highschool is a very diffecult one. As kids start to grow older there minds also change and sometimes the dreams they had of becoming someone or something is different in highschool.

Many young students in highschool don't really know what they want to be when they get older. And sometimes highschool forces kids to try to find the job or jobs they want to do when they get older. I feel like as a highschool student my self, and as an 11th grader I still don't know what I want to be when I am older. I feel like for young adults like me school isnt the only thing they have in mind. For example, I have a lot of out of school activitys that take away from always just focusing on school. Also for highshcool kids relationships can be a hard. They take up all your time and they also make you angry and stressed. And that can also take away from learning and your future as I know very well myself.

As young adults, Students that don't really have the ropes done in our day to day life in highschool I dont think commiting to a career in highschool is a good idea. I think schools should be teaching kids about different jobs and fields they might want to get into. But I dont think forcing kids to make there choises in highschool is something teachers should be focusing on. Instead they should be focusing on how different students learn in others ways. There are always kids that can learn and achive everything by just sitting in a class room and listening to a teacher talk. And there are the kids that can't just learn in a class room. The kids that have hard time at school becasue they have disabilities.

Teaching students in highschool to be succesful is what highschool need to do. I feel like schools mainly focus on getting kids to collage and what not. But some students dont want to go to collage or even get a job durring or even after school. I feel like school should help students become successful in school but not drive them towards anything. Meaning students should feel free to do what ever they want after highschool. And it all starts with teachers asking kids what they want to do when they grow up. And a lot of students dont even know what they are going to do in the next 2 months to come.

Sometimes collage is not what everyone wants. For me I want to take a gap year right out of highschool. And go play soccer somewhere. In my highschool days so far, Highschool was always been hard and its a big step from middle school. The teachers are not really on you as much as they were in middle school. So it makes u feel like u have more time for yourself. And its good in some ways becasue it teachers u how to be indepentent. But also as teachers give u more lead way students become more likely to do worse. They think its just easy to skip classes and not get in trouble. So for me everything that i have explained makes choosing a career during highschool really hard.

All in all students should feel like they have the fredom to do what they want when they are at the later years of highschool with out the burden of everyone around him or her telling them they have to go to collage or that they have to choose a career when they are in highschool.

I think Making studetns choose a career when they are in highschool is not something schools should be focused on. They should be focusing on having kids grow and not having them choose there careers at a young age. ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
2F268BE28055,"Failure play's an important part in your life and it also lead you to success. why would many people thinks that failure lead you to success?. Well failure is one of the things that help you look back at yourself, so that you can start asking yourself questions that matters and that will help you succeed. You cannot survive in this world without you failing, or you having some kind of trouble that want to make you give up. The reasons why I agree with Churchill's statement is, because school, parents, and your career are things that help and give you hope, so that you can succeed.

The first things that play's an important part and you need in life is Education. School teach you things the hard ways and by you learning it the hard ways, help you fix your mistake in a better way. Your school work is what going to lead you to your success and your next journey in life. Without your education, it will be hard for you to succeed, or to even think about what kind of experience you could've have and what kind of person you could've been. You failing is teaching you how life is, what your next journey can be, and how much effort that you going to put into it. For you to succeed you have to fail, so that you can actually grow up, learn how life goes, and learn from your mistake. Education help you succeed in a better, clean, and a proper way.

The second thing that's important and that you need in your life is your parents. They advise you of how they were able to succeed, have a family, and how failing is a bless, because you get to learn from that. Your parents support you in the good moments and also in the bad moments. It is when other people are supporting and giving you advice other than your parents, because you going to have to choose if it a good advice or a bad one. That is why when you happen to have any of your parent supporting you, or giving you advice, you should be greatful. Some teenagers loose hope and their confident when they're failing, because they have no support, no one to give them advice, and they're lonely with no parents. That is also why your parents play an important role on your success even though, you keep failing.

The third thing that helps you see things clearly and that challenge you, is your career. when you have a career, or want to have a career, it is where you going to start making mistakes. By you having a good career and want to keep it, but you keep failing actually help you learn how to succeed. You having a job helps express yourself, more mature, and it help you learn how to challenge yourself, so by you doing that, leads you to success. You challenging yourself, help you see a better and a more challenging person. Your career help you stand up for your mistake, challenge yourself, and fix your mistake.

Most people would think that failure leads you to success and fewer people would think that failure leads you to giving up. ""Success consist of going from failure without loss of enthusiasm."" They might think that it is peoples opinion, because why go to school when you can succeed the dirty way. What these people think is that their succeeding, but what they don't know is that their keep failing over and over again. Playing it the dirty way is not you succeeding, but it is you proving to yourself that you keep failing. That is why failure play an important role in pursuing your success.

I agreed with Winston Churchill, because success does consist of you failing. The reasons why I agreed with

Winston Churchill is, because Education, parents and career are important things and people that helps you succeed. By you failing thesempeople and things are the one's giving you advice and help you be more self assured. Everyday in this life you're challenging yourself with new things and these things, are things that you need to keep doing, so that you can succeed. You will never be successful unless, you failed.

305EFA6DBBBF,"Do we choose our own character traits?

As the British naturalist and politican Jonh Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I certanly agree that everyone is capeable of choosing their own character trait, they are independent enough to have control over themselves', they're capeable to choose in what type of enviroment they want to be in, or how to react to bad or good circumtances, at the end of the day we all have the freedom to choose who, and what we want to be.

Jonh Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.' everyone have the completly control over themselves, no matter how bad the circumtances may be or how tough a problem is, everyone will always be allow to choose either to smile or cry, to be positivee or negative for example;

My grandma, she's a 78 years old lady that have work her entire life, she's a very independent women who always says, ""If i don't do it, no one can make it as good as i can."" Always with a positive attitude, never sitting down, because she says that sitting down is a waste of time, and she have always been so energetic, until one day that sadly she had a really strong stroke in the middle of her brain that made her lose movement on half of her body, and her voice, her doctor told us that she was going to stay in a wheel chair for the rest of her life, it was hard to see someone so positive and with so much energy, in a wheel chair for the rest of her life, everyone was really shock and depressed about it including my mom, but even though my grandma knew what was going on her positive attitude never change, she took over the circumstances and she never gave up on herself she decided to be ""positive"", even though it was a rough time in life, this example helped me to see that everyone have their own control or they can choose who they want to be in the hard or easy times.

Everyone can have the freedom to choose the enviroment around them, how they wanna live, with who they wanna leave, people have the abilitly to understand when there are toxic people around them, to understand how much an enviroment can change the way they act, to understand that they can change the negative enviroment into a positive enviroment, everything in your character depends on your onw person, yes the enviroment that is around you can affect a lot on your character, affects on what you do in a daily base, but at the end of the day it alwasy depends on you, who you wanna be, who the people around you should make you feel, and how positive or negative it should be.

Having a reaction with other people around you can show them what your character is, it can show people your weakest part, and can shows them how dangerous or calm you can be, reactions are a really big part of our characters either if we have the control of them or not, how we react and how we respond depends on us, for a lot of people having their own character it's really hard, because of their negative or positive mood, sometimes we want to be or act like other people that we see at school, but that's like stealing their characters, at least but not last everyone have the freedom to choose what their character traits are or can be.

In conclusion everyone is free to choose what they character should be, no matter if they are going through a rough time or have the whole word agains them, theywill always have the chance of trying to be someone else character or build their own, but it will alwaysbe what they choose their character traits to be.

310CDA45739E,"Imagination is like thinking to do diet and go to gym to get slim. Knowledge is just like running on a treadmil for 2 hours in a weak to get your weight under 79.

I believe that Imagination is more Important than knowledge, because when the writer writes a book, first they Imagine the topic for their book. They don't start to write the book unless they Imagine the topic.

Same as, the writers Imagine what they want to write about, they don't just start to get Information about something, asking their parents what to write, how to write. They Imagine, then they start their work.

However, Imigination is also similar when you think with your sister to convince your mom to get you lots of candy. You don't ask your dad, how to convice mom to get candy. For example, the person who get the idea to Invent phone, frst he Imagine,

what does phone look like, how many buttons should be there, and then he also get help with his knowledge but first he Imagine what does phone look like, how will people buy this, why should they buy my phone.

Also If we use knowledge more than Imagination, the new generation will only use the cell phones to search for their homeworks. They will not Imagine to do homeworks or other things by theirself. They will just copy someone's idea, which is going to demolish their brains. There will be no more good inventions, The people's brain will stop working. Also, people will not do their work because they know they can just copy someone's idea.

For example, If I dont Imagine that when I will be 16, how I am going to get a job. What If I just go to Youtube and search for it, but I will not find anything and I will waste my Important time. Incase if I imagine what kind of job I want to do or where I want to do, I am pretty sure that It will not waste my time. Infact It will give me some ideas for future. In my opinion we should imagine more than using knowledge.

Imagination keeps your brain work and It also keeps you active. If we dont use imagination then how our new Inventors will Introduce their creative inventions. If the stylists doesnot use their imagination then how we are going to wear brautiful clothes. If they use just knowledge and don't use their imagination, I guess they will not get that much success in their buisness. Designers use their minds to help with their clothes design. They imagine the ideas for clothes, so the people will buy more and more clothes from them.

The people who use Imagination more than knowledge live longer. From now I will also use imagination as more as I can. So I will give an opinion to all of you who are reading this use your imagination than knowledge and get success in your work. I don't say that using knowledge is a waste of time, use your knowledge also but not all the time, also use your mind to imagine good, Intresting things.

In conclusion Imagination is more Important than knowledge. So, I will agree with scientist Albert Einstein. I will also force you to think about this. Writers, designers , Inventors all uses their Imagination more than knowledge. Now I will also try to focus on my Imagination more than focusing to copy other's information.

Students need a specific career by the time they enter to high school.

I'm agree with this article because you already know what do you wnat to do and study to be a proffesional in a future just choose a career that you like it, and then do it.

choose a career that you feel that you like it, and practice all the time for example; I like the mechanic career. I like the cars, and I feel that mechanic would be a good career, because you fix the cars, and I think I can get good money for it.

when you feel that something you like it, you want to do all the time, if you have a career that you like it, practice you career for example; I love play soccer and, play soccer is one of my favorite things I like to do in the summer I practice a lot soccer , one of my dream is to be a proffesional soccer player one day because I love soccer choose one career of proffesional always keep in your mind, and try to do the best to get your career. Each student have a career that they like, but sometimes they don't get the career that they want for reason of the life, but do you best to get finished you career one day for example; my sister she wanted to be a nurse, and she always practice the things that one nurse do, and she always studied a lot for be a nurse, and now she have six year working of nurse. She get career that she wanted, and she told me that when she was little she wanted to be a nurse, and now she is a nurse.

31B604C7D90F,"Should school cafeteria change to a new, healthier lunch menu, for students? In this essay, I will argue why school should not change to a new healthier lunch. School should keep the same lunch menu because students will lost their favorite foods, students will start to pack their own lunch, and foods will be wasted.

Reasons why school should keep the same lunch menu instead of changing to a new, healthier school lunch menu, because each students have their own favorite foods, such as Chicken Sandwich, Pasta Chicken, and Tortilla. Futhermore, Tuesday is my favorite lunch day because it's Tortilla's day. Tortilla, also a healthy food because it have a corns, meats, tomatoes and other vegetables depend on what we like. For me, when I get to eat my favorite foods I feel blessed especially when I'm hungry.

These days, there are many restaurants out there like Mcdonald, ChickfillA ,and many more. Hence, instead of paying for school lunch that you don't like people can just bring their own lunch from home or from outside. It's better for people to buy foods from outside rather than buy foods at school and wasted. Sometime home foods are cleanier than school foods. Students might consider bringing their own lunch. The good thing about it is we can choose what we want to eat.

Every type of foods are expensive, we the students doesn't want to waste it. Thinking back to the poor people outside there craving for foods, I felt bad for them. In contrast, it's hard for us to eat the foods we doesn't like even if we are hungry. If the students doesn't like the foods, they might throw away, or not purchasing it. The school foods will be wasted, and at the end they will throw it away too. Providing students favorite foods are important, students will eat and school will not suffer from wasted.

School cafeteria should keep the same lunch menu. Some says, healthy school lunch are good for students health, but they are wrong. If school principal continues to change school cafeteria plans, students will not be happy and might start changing school for a better lunch.            ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5
31EEF9A4A29B,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think that students will benefit more from distance learning than from going to school. Not everyone agrees that going school is for them. Distance learning is gives a better chance to learn all your education.

Here are a couple reasons why I support the idea of distance learning.

First, reason why I think that distance learning is more beneficial to you is because you can manage your time better with class work and classes. You have the opportunity to work on your own schedule. Separate the classes throughout the day instead of all bunched up at once. More time for you to focus on either classes you kind of struggle with or classes most important. All work does not have to have a due date or time limit. You can take your time to understand the material at hand and do all your work when capable.

Secondly, the more comfortable the environment the better you work. Schools environment isn't so good for students, sometimes we sit in classes where its hard to learn. Hard to learn because a lot of kids do not take there work serious, stay off task, and distract others from learning. That harms the learning environment makes kids get a little frustrated at times with there work. Its not easy to do your work while not being able to concentrate correctly and being distracted. When you are in a comfortable environment, work is not so complicated. You can relax, think straight, and focus on the task at hand with no problems. Being able to attend class from home keeps you away from the bad environment.

Last but not least, the safety of the students is always important. While in school kids can be harmed in different type of ways. Some get bullied others get into altercations. This is hard to stay away from because you are in school and it surrounds you. This can definitely throw off a student and get them off track. When kids start to think about many other problems instead of there school work it is not good. Attending your classes at home, online, or through video conference is the safest way to attend. You wouldnt have to worry about the school drama or the bullies. Your mind will be strictly focused on the work you have to do and nothing less.

In conclusion, the idea of students attending classes from home, video conference, or online. Is most beneficial because of there safety, work environment, and schedule. I agree with my reasoning and support them to the max because distance learning is the best way to learn. Your student should give distance learning a chance its worth it. ",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
32E2949B0C66,"Do you ever want to do something fun at your school that you really like? Well you came to the right school, cause the principal made a rule that you either have to play a sport or join a club that you like.

You could play on a basketball team

You could play on a football team

You could play on a flag football team

You could play on a baseball team

You could play on a softball team

You could play for a soccer team you could join a cheering team

I agree with the principal because, when we get home we don't do anything and kids are lazy nowadays. We either take a nap, eat, watch YouTube, or play video games. Also it will give kids a chance to have fun and make new friends and see what they like so they can do it the future.

So if you don't agree with me, I'll give more reasons like kids are overweight, they're lazy, most of them won't do anything cause they are out of shape. Probably the first thing they do when they get his eat and play video games and watch YouTube. So that is why the principal put in the new rule, they could make new friends while they're after school or join something their friends are in. Also it will be good if your going to play in high school sports cause you already known what it takes to be on the sport team.

It is really fun cause you when you play a game that is home you will feel good cause everyone from your school is there cheering you on. Also if you win your game at home it feels nice cause everyone is cheering your team on and then when you go back to school everyone will be taking about the win. If you don't believe me ask anyone that plays/played for a school team, most likely your parents played for a school team both of my parents did.

If your not interested in sports you could do other afters school activities like

Book club

Yearbook club

Dance club

Cooking club

Computer club

Student council

Engineering club

You could do those clubs in stead of playing sports, You could also do many other things that you like if you don't like any of this thing. Ask your teacher if you could make club and if she says yes go to her office. If you don't like your club cause everything was filled it is fine, cause you could join it the next semester but you have to be one of the first to sign the sign-up sheet. Also you be given a snack at the beginning of your after school period you could choose anything and, if you take the bus it will be there so you can go home.

But if you don't take the bus you will have to be picked up by 4:30 and then you be home and do whatever you want to do. But if your parent can pick you after school you could leave at the normal time school gets out and if your not feeling good you could also leave at the normal time. But before you could anything you have to do your homework and then go to your after school club.

If you don't want to go you will have to go to the principal and explain why you can't, but if it is a dumb reason you will have to go to after school. Like if you have a broken leg and you play on a sport team you could still go to practice and see what they are doing and see al the drills they are doing. Also if you fake an injure and the teacher find your big trouble cause you not listening to the principal. But you could get kicked out if your being bad and you will have to serve a punishment cause your still on school grounds. Like you you hit a student you will get suspended but if you hit the teacher you will get expelled.

If your playing sports it is all year long until the season ends, if your coach finds out your is taking drugs you will get kicked of the team. You will have the same rules as a high school cause you probably play for the high school team. But it won't costs any money cause the principal made us join the clubs so we could do something after school. Most likely we will find our hobby forever cause we are going to do it for the rest of the semester. If you find something that someone is doing and you want to do it just tell the teacher cause they will put you guys together.

If you still don't agree with me you should just try it out cause it fun, You could have fun, make new friends and bond over things you all like. Like sports if you join one of the sport teams you could meet someone with same interest like you. Same with all the other club that the school is providing to the students, like book club you could like the same book as someone else and be best friend over that one book cause you joined the book club. I met one of my best friend through basketball and we liked other stuff that wasn't basketball related.

Most likely you won't like it at first but then when your half-way through the year you will love it. Most of the time I join a club that i like cause it fun to meet new people that have the same interest as you. Sometimes the club isn't fun but that is okay cause you could join a new one. Most of the time everyone will be shy at the beginning cause no one knows each other but half way through the semester you will known everyone. Cause everyone won't be shy cause they will see you everyday plus, when your in school at lunch and you don't known anyone and you see one of those people you could sit with them. When you meet a new person they will have friends so you could more friends when the new person shows you to them.

So what we know is that joining an after school program could give you a lot of benefits and friend. Also they is a lot of clubs and sports you could join for fun. Also eat a free snack so your not hungry when you get home to your parents.

So now you ask more then one person about something you don't know what to do or if you have trouble solving something other people can help you and give you good advice and other can give you advice but are bad choices so just ask someone for help or ask someone you trust and will help you. But do you know why it's a good idea asking for help? Well it's good to ask for help because some one can give you advice on what to and what to not do and asking to much people can give you way much ideas on what to do,This helps so much people that needs help because they are like asking people for help and they are helping us to do better choice then a bad choice, Every one can give you a advice on whats better for you problem or question and it will help so much like Parents, Family , and Friends.

Kids can ask advice to everyone even there Teacher, Counselor , And mostly there parents they're always be there if you need help and need advice and they will give you a really better idea, But what i think is better for you guys is ask an a adult then a student just to not make a bad idea and start doing things your not suppose to, So kids just talk to a grown up and they will help you with the advice you need.

We all sometimes need advice by someone so just ask and you'll get a advice you need and everyone will help you help your self don't think that only you need advice we all have something to tell a person and give us there opinion, We are like asking them what they gonna do if they need a advice and is passing the same thing we passing.

When the person you talked about gived you a advice you'll think about it and if it's a good choice you do it and everything comes to peace that's why i can help you if you ask for an advice and it will help you in the fueature too so just ask for advice and they'll give you it.

What if a friend dosen't give you an advice? Then tell your pearents or an adault a school or work to help you, Did you know older people need advice too? Yeah older people need advice too they even need help on things like us not just because they are older it dosen't mean they are not like us that they need advice.

In what do we need advice? We need advice in somethhing we have done bad or you don't know what to do or you have problems you need some advice from someone for they can help you on it that's really important helping someone that needs a advice.

What happens if you don't get an advice? What happen is that you will get depress or get stressed thinking on what to do, And if you get depress if can be dangoures you'll be always be upset won't want to do anything you won't even want to eat or anything that's why if you need a adivce ask someone to help you and you'll be so much better.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,2.5

Most people wanted to get better after they have had worked on themselves to be successful already, but in the other hand, people did not have opportunity to go to school. or may be they just did not feel confident enough that they could be better. In my opinion, I think that people should try their best to be something that will benefit other people so that you gain support and just keep expanding.

The first reason why I agree on Emeerson's statement is because. The more you have experience in something, the more chances you have on getting better at it. I think that getting better at something is really important in life in order to live a good lifestyle. But some people are not able to make changes to their selves. They maybe dealing with family issues or personal issues that is keeping them to take advantage of changing.

Another reason why I agree on Emeerson's statement is because. Most people have skills that they learned when they were young which is considered knowledge. That specific skill or knowledge might help you advance something. But at the same time a lot of people have disappointments on their selves and surroundings, which can cause the thinking of not changing to the better.

The final reason of why I agree on Emeerson's statement is because. Most people when they are confident and comfortable, then they would release the skills and persuade the change that is going to make them a better person, and that could change their life forever. it is convenience and worth making the change no matter what the situation be so do not take advantages the wrong way

After all, there has been a lot of different opinions and ideas all around the world, but you as an individual should know what is best for you. we have talked about why and why not people should move up to the next step which is changing. changing can harm or improve you if you do it the right way, by taking chances since young then, most of us would have a lot more better strategies and know what is right from wrong by the time we grow.

Technology has had impacted us negative wise and positive wise. For a lot of people they see technology as a huge positive impact for people.

People may think now that technology is out people contact other people way less but high chance that's not the case. People that do things like gaming or just connection with others online make it way easier to meet other people. For example theres websites like Omegle where you just go on and get into a voice chat with a random person around the country or maybe in other countries. There's also many other websites or apps where you can contact random people or even friends and family. There's also gaming, for gamers you usually go into lobbies or servers with thousands of people which is also an easier to contact people. For example if you own a PC, a PlayStation, or even an Xbox there's many games where you can contact people if you're making new friends or even just playing with them for as long until someone gets off. I have heard many stories where people have met online and grew a friendship even though they've never met in person they probably have each other's social media and numbers.

Many people use technology to shop. Online shopping is an easier way of finding things you need or even things you want. People commonly do online shopping only because it's just easier and quicker. Some people may have a busy schedule so it will make things easier if they're running errands or even just going out and spending time with family or friends without having to add something else to their list of plans. Online shopping is probably something everyone has done multiple times and many people can agree that it is easier and quicker than driving out to the store and searching through the whole store to find the things you want or need.

In conclusion of this technology has made a positive impact in our lives in many things that people do on a daily basis. Technology could be seen as positive or negative depending on how people see it but in my eyes it's done a good job and has definitely made things easier for a lot of people.",5.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0
33E25E6A8028,"dear principal, i think students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school during the school day. It is important to allow students to have them incase of a emergency . cell phones are also important to have because they are very useful if something goes wrong they are able to call 911 or 311 for personal help. They should also be allowed because cell phones is a good way to let students keep contact during school free hours.

It is important to let students have them incase of a emergency . A lot of students can use their phone if they have been hurt . If a student gets bullied by other peers they can call the school and let them know that someone has been hurt by other students from school. If something bad had happen to that student during school hours they can always use their cell phone.

they are also useful to have because sometimes a lot of things can go wrong.

Students at some point we have accidents like spilling milk on our shirts or not making it to the washroom and we can use our phone to call mom and dad to bring us extra clothing. cell phones are not always to text but also just a good thing to have during school.

you never know what can happen during the end of the day like going home. Their are so many dangerously things that can happen and its important to have a cell phone to call 911 . and they are cool to be allowed during free classes and be able to use them at some point during our day.(:",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

Sometimes in homework clubs, They do fun lesson to under what to do on the homework. For example, at my old homework club, We sometimes have a field trip to the public library to some fun lesson. In homework club, you sometimes get help from the teacher, or classmates. At my old homework club, We sometimes video chat to some famous authors. Sometimes we play fun games with the principal.

34E4FB64EEBA,"Don't you think that we should be what we are no matter who is around?

Is important that we give or have our own opinion. For me, my opinion is always important because is what it makes me unique, and what I think is that I know that some people is afraid to be what they are. Because they are afraid to the reaction of people that they love, for example the most important person in my life is my mom and she is the center of my life, like my dad... But you know something? I'm nervous about the reaction of them, if I act like I want, If I dress the way I like it, I'm afraid that my family or my friends judge me.

I think that the author ""Ralph Waldo Emerson"", is right. I'm agree with the Idea that he have about the world.

People around us is just looking for something to talk about and if for example, I do something wrong, the friends of my mom will talk about me and in a worst case, my mom will do the same. The world influence a lot in ourself in many ways for example:

You will see people following what other person say if he move to one side he or she will do the same.

When we are little people influence, tellling you to do the same that the other kid is doing. In some schools they don't let you to use imagination, like, you have to do what is there and in my opinion the kids should be free to write or draw what they want. I think that it will help to develop our ideas and be succesful.

Mom always is telling you to be like him or she. That she wish this and that and we are tryinng to do those things and be like they want, that we forget about us and we try to be someone else.

We have many expectations about what we can be, how many things can we accomplish, we make many questions to ourself and we try to be someone that is not us, just to make happy the rest of the people, when we should be looking for our own happiness, life is short, life is now and we have to be what it makes us happy, life doesn't make sense if we live in a place or have people around us that is just stealing our happiness. The world is big and is true that influences, even in our decisions. We have the choice to be what we want. Is our decision, is our opinion, is important to be what we are and not what they want.

There is some people that is not agree with this idea. They think that the world is not trying to make you someone else, that there is not any influence and be what the other people tell you to be, that the opinion don't affect and it shouldn't have any problem to act or be what they want. But, I think that people around us can influence in our decisions, because we don't want that people we love get upset about us. We are always worried about the opinions of the rest and that is a big example of how the world influence about us and in our personality.

We all have have something that it makes us unique and special of be. Everybody have different opinions, and there are some people that want others to follow what they said and is not the way it works. The world have many of good things and bad things but what will happen if we just follow what they said, people that is guiding is thinking that it will have the same or better results, but no, we have different results to the differents situations and that's why is important to be what we are and do what we like, because in that way, we know how to act to the situation and if will be a good thing for us to follow, is very important that we show ourself and get courage to confront many difficult situations.

35C5C7E2BB5E,"Working with a group or working alone which one is more beneficial? Well to me working with a group is more beneficial for many reasons. First off you can get help from other members of your group, you don't have to do everything alone you can give each person one thing to do, and you can learn more about the topic. Now that you know my reasons of why i think being in a group is much better and more beneficial then working alone let me go more in depth about it.

Working in a group is great because they can help you with the assignment. If you are struggling and one of your group members sees that you need help then they will help you. They will try and make you understand the problem so you know how to do it. They will give you different strategies and other ways to figure out the answer. For example my math teacher put me and one of my friend in a group for a assignment we were doing and i did not understand the concept. I asked my friend to help me and she sat down with me and showed me how to do it. She gave me multiple ways on how to do it and if it wasn't for her help i would still be lost and not know what to do.

Another reason why working in a group is better then working alone is that each person in your group gets a specific thing to do. If each person gets a specific thing to do in the group then everything will go by much faster. You would not have to worry about doing everything by your self and putting that stress on your body you will have other members in your group that will do their part of the assignment. Last week in history class my teacher put me in a group with 3 other members. We all had a specific thing to do i had to find the citation for the information we got,Chloe found all the information on the topic, Marcus found pictures of the information, and Sean found videos to support the information that we had. We finished the project at then end of class and we also got a A as our grade.

Finally you can learn more about the topic with your other group members. They could find information on your topic that you once did not know before. It can give each student new ideas and information to make the topic more clear for them and also find new discoveries. It will also help them for test and even a quiz because they just did group work and also answered questions and learned new things as well. This is my final reason on why working in a group is much better then working alone.

You can learn more about the topic, you dont have to do all the work by your self, and also your other group members will be helping you if you do not understand the topic and need a little more help. These are my reasons of why i think this is much better then working alone all the time. Having a group will give you more advantages then just being by your self trying to do all the work. It is much more beneficial and i also gave valid reason of why i think being in a group is much better then working alone.     ",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
36035C063AB3,"Can many things be done if we are always doing? succeed comes with hard work and hard comes with trying, but everyone has different opinions and points of views. Although others believe otherwise, there is always something new to learn in this world, we can influence others for the better, and we can accomplish more if we are always ready to keep doing something.

I believe the world has plenty of things and places we have not yet explored, learned about or have seen before. Everywhere you go, you learn a something new about someone or something; it could be a new culture, places in the world or even a new language, but that is only if you keep doing. For example, I was born in Generic_City and when I came here for the first time everything was new to me. Starting from seeing different faces to a completely new language, I kept trying to learn more and more about the United states because that is how you keep on doing more and not stopping your learning process. When i first went to school here i was afraid and very shy, but that did not stop me from learning the language and sure i learned something new every day because there was so much to explore all around. That is why I believe that there is something new to try and learn everywhere you go. If you encourage yourself to keep doing, you would not believe all the things you can do for yourself. Which those things sometimes can help you improve yourself and the way you view different things as well.

If you keep doing and learning more, you can absolutely influence others for the better. You can teach others from the mistakes you have made from trying new things and from all the experiences you have had before as well. Someone that I look up to as my role model is my older sister, because she taught me how to be the strong young women I am today. She influenced me for the better, because of what she has been through before me. One thing she taught me that was very important to me is to not give up on my goals and my mindset from the beginning. She once told me that people will doubt me no matter who they are, and one of those people was my mother. My mom taught that my sister and I would not even get to college, but here I am as a junior in high school and my sister about to graduate college. A day never went by without my sister reminding me of how strong and independent I can be if i keep trying and keep learning because the world is full of things to learn from, good or bad. My sister had to keep learning and was always trying to do something new, because she new she could influence me for the better so i could learn from her mistakes. There is always gonna be someone out there with advice for you and to influence you for the better, but if you keep learning and trying nothing is impossible. Influencing others can be very important, mostly for the younger generation. They look up to us now and it should be an honor to show them the rights from the wrongs but that is only possible if you try to have a good mindset of always wanting to be a better person and knowing what you want. Never stop trying to learn new things because there will always be something out there to learn from and to look at it from a different point of view.

Accomplishing a goal can be very hard sometimes and even makes you wanna give up but that is something you should not do. If you are always doing and trying new things you can accomplish so much more than you would ever imagine you could. My goal was to learn English, go to school, and graduate all to prove my parents and my older sister i could. I accomplished part of my goals so far and that makes me feel very proud of myself because i feel like i am slowly accomplishing my goals in a short period of time. When i was younger and until now i have always liked books and that is something that helped me learn English and to improve my learning techniques in school as well. I have not yet graduated but that is a goal that i am maintaining and that i know i will accomplish soon, but the only way that will happen is if i keep doing and learning more every time i possibly can. You may have people who doubt you or who do not want to see you succeed but you should never let them control your mindset and the way you do things. A positive mindset always comes with a positive outcome, and always surround yourself with good people because we are here to make good things happen to each other. But keeping your mind open to new things will always help you learn more everyday and have new experiences too.

You just need to believe in yourself and understand that there is so much more out there that you could not know about, and that it is always good to encourage yourself to go out there and try things you have never tried before. always influence others for the better and accomplish all your goals no matter how hard it can get, because at the end of the day every good thing you do will absolutely pay off later on when you least expect it or see it coming. In conclusion I believe Thomas Jefferson's quote is very true because of all the wonderful things we can learn, experiences we can have, and things we can accomplish with time if we keep on doing.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
3651697D855B,"FAILURE PLAYS IN THE PURSUIT OF SUCCESS.

I agree with the statement by the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who said that "" success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". The word ""failure"" is been pictured as been a disapointment to family, friends or to oneself. Mostimes,everybody wants to succed in anything they do, but faces some challenges at the process to acheive that expected goal. This challenges are not necessarily proposed to affect you in a bad way, but sets a room for improvement and perfection.

Failure brings a feeling of confidence to a person, working on a project for a long time and fixing mistakes you came across. Makes an individual confident,understanding everything that concern that work and feeling more relaxed doing it without so much anxiety. Mr Rubio, was told to come up with an Architectural plan for a building close to a water fall. Rubio knew this project was close to impossible for him to complete this task, but he accepted it and started making the building plan. After he taught he came up with a suitable plan for the building, it got rejected by the state building commitee, because they asked him why certain things were placed this way and he couldn't answer effectively . He had to go back and identify he's faults in the building plan, and come up with a bettter one. Rubio had sleepless nights, communicating with various Architects and Civil enginers to get some idea on he's work. When Rubio was convinced he was ready to take the project to the board meeting he felt confident in himself and knew he could explain evrything corncernig he's building plan to the comitee. When he turned in the drawing, and was asked some certain questions he quickly answerd them with absolute confidence and got approved.

Secondly, the more you face challenges life throws at you makes you stronger. If everything in the world moved in a positive way we won't invent things inorder to satisfy our human needs. Isaac Newton and other scientst encounterd a problem and decided to solve this problems by making inventions. So work could be done faster, reduce Man power and done more effectively. Before isaac Newton got the light bulb to work , he failed ninety nine times of he's experiment. This failures didn't stop him from acheiving he's goal, he kept on striving hard making research and later came up with a long lasting light bulb. Which helps us see clearly in a dark place.

Although it takes time, to achieve this goals after failing. Most people would get frustrateed and quit, there is an old saying ""nothing good comes easy"". To achieve whatever you desire in life, you have to be ready to encounter difficulties and failure, but approching this problems knowing that you are going to get better it just takes time and patience. After acheiving this goals what would be seen is your acomplishments rather than your failures.                                                      ",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5

Most people say the type of traits a person can have define who are as a person, and saying that is ture because the kind of trait you would have or choices can define your character. like for instances let's say you are a very working person your so dedicated to your work that is a trait of dedication or when a person is so nice to you that shows kindness another trait. Even mabybe a person who likes to read that would be a bookworm this is also a trait. Everybody has a trait that they choose.

We choose our owns traits because we think or we know that's the kind of traits we want to have. I am a person who loves to read books, loves food, kind to others, and who can be lazy at most time.

Others think it's the opposite because your trait can be choose by the type influnces but i have to disagree on that because people in this world choice the kind of traits they want to have.

In life you live and learn lessons, dealing with stress after stress, or learning that every struggle you faced at the end it will pay off.

The key to success in life is having a positive attitude: never envy what others have, nor wish bad upon a person for their success. Trust the process, life will knock you down, get you at your lowest but having that positive attitude towards every struggle and having that positive mindset to others will get you further than you think, having that negative attitude towards everything wont get you far in life: hatred, jealousy, and hard headed wont take you nowhere: in life you are going to face the fact that not everything will go right, and not everything is going to be how you want it.

This statement about having a positive attitude is the key to success in life is true, nothing will get you far if you have a negative attitude towards everything that comes your way. If something didnt work out there's always a reason why it didnt went how you expected it, either you decide to work harder to get where you want to get or just give up and not do anything to get you closer where you want to be.

It will be easier to hold the information when you return in the fall. The days will be shorter since the school year is longer. I believe not everyone has something to do over the 3 months of summer break.

It will be easier for people to hold the information when they return in the fall. A large amount of people forget what they learn in school when they return from the 3 months of summer break. Everytime summer break comes I forget mostly all the information information I learned, it just leaves my head over those months. When we get 3-4 weeks over summer break, not all the information will leave. It will be easier for us students to not forget what we learned over the months.

School days will be shorter since the school year is longer or we can have one weekday off and have school at a regular time. They can change it so students don't have to wake early in the morning. Some people can't wake up early and some people get off work late and have school the next day. Students can have one weekday off, like a Wensesday or Friday off. It will give them time to relax and stay focus on school. Since, the school days are shorter, they can have time to theirselfs and not be stressed.

I believe not everyone has something to do over the three months of summer break. They might just do something for one month and for the another two months might not do anything. They might just stay inside and play video games all day and not read or not pick up a book the whole break. They might not even exercise all day. Students need to have something to do over the breaks, so they can keep learning.

Sometime I believe it's a bad idea. Students will stay a school the whole year until they gradute, and they need to spend time with their family. Some students don't really like school and they will get too stressed and breakdown over the year, so they need a long break from school. Students need time for theirselfs, so they don't stress as much. Students will stress over too much work and they have after school jobs, so they can't do their homework.

Having 3-4 weeks of summer break, a longer winter, and a week off in the spring and fall is a great idea. It will be easier to hold the information when you return in the fall.

But they should also think about the students point of view. They don't see the students point of view. How they feel about this? But No, Educators shouldn't make students' break year-round school, where there should be a 3-4 week break in the summer, and a week off in spring and fall because they don't have as much time spending with their family and most students also have responsibility.

The first reason is that they don't spend time with there family. School is taking there time when they go back home. Students comes everyday day at home to do their homework and make sure they have everything ready for the next day of there school life. Some even has projects to work on. While the student is only worry about that; they forget about there parent for a while. That can really effect them because they don't give enough truth to there parent about whats going on in there life. Anything can be happening. And educator feels that student's breaks are too short. That the first reason why they shouldn't make students' break year-round school, where there should be a 3-4 week break in the summer, and a week off in spring and fall.

Finally, the second reason is most students also have responsibility. Student also have a life and things to do. In summer, spring and winter break is where most students try to help there parent around and use there free, how ever they want. They don't have to stress as much over homework and projects. Most student also believe everything they learn at school is not worthy information that why they come back forget most of the thing they learned at school. This is the last reason.

Although, some people feel that summer break is too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. There are people who believe over wise. The fact remain that educators shouldn't make students' break year-round school, where there should be a 3-4 week break in the summer, and a week off in spring and fall because they don't have as much time spending with their family and most students also have responsibility.

I think that energy and resources in the schools is not a bad idea, but for some students is a good option to make homework and enjoy of them with accesible confidence, if we don't have energy for four days of school can be really hard to make everything at the same time like other students because we are a lot students and we can't use that same computer at the same time because is not the same homework or is not easy to find it and we can take more time then others, that's why I think that is not a really good idea for all students,

Other students think in not because some students use that internet just for see facebook or video games and they lose time that other can use , but they can't talk for everyone because some students use that internet for really good reasons like homework , read books , and other things .

Other reason to not conserve energy can be the air conditioner if we don't have energy the air conditioner is does't work and depends how is outside the weather can be affect at the students, and teacher because what if is snow outside and we don't have air conditioner we can get sick or pain in bones, if we don't have energy we can't charge the phones and we can't talk with our parents or if we have an emergency and we don't have energy how we called at the ambulance ,is that's why energy is a really good resource to comunicated with other and make somethings importants .

In benefits ,we can safe more energy because we use the energy just in limited time , the bill of the energy in the school can be less than then before and we can have more resources for our school too .We can have differents activities outside.

In conclusion , if we don't have energy for four days of school ,everything can be hard for us ,some businesses can be conserve energy and resources because is a different condition in their business , but for schools the energy is a good resource to the knoledge of the students .

3BFECA0F8470,"Has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people's lives? My opinion is negative for people's lives. Because we can do nothing without technology. If we are in the house, we didn't do any communicate with family. We will get sick. I believe technology is bad for our life. And technology will hurt many people.

First of all, Technology had negative effects on people's lives. Because we can do nothing without technology. Since, I was in Generic_City, I forgot my phone to bring outside. And I was doing nothing that day. I thought I have to focus my life without technology. We can do many things without technology. For example, we can do shopping with friends, we can play board game with people, and we can do talking each others. I believe technology making me more dumb. Also, technology will be my life controller.

Second reason is if we are in the house, we didn't do any communicate with family. When I was in my house our family did not talking and they are doing their own work. I was so sad about this. My mom just watch TV, my dad did a slept, and my sister did play the phone game. At that time I want a talk to my family but they was very busy. I miss my time to talk about my school life with my family. Also we did not know about each family members favorite and what you don't like. So When my birthday party, my family members don't know what I want to get.

want a say, "" You have to do communicate with your family as much as you can."" It will be help your whole life.

Last is we will get sick. For example, your eyes get hurt. Because if you watch video a lot, you will get blind. So you can not see anymore. Your health is very important in your life. Too much technology will dangerous in your life. I love game, but I delete my all games because when I was young, I started the game, but I get sick more and more. I thought ""If I am doing game more I will be die."" So I was delete all my games. Also, You will be overweight.

Because your not moving and you ate a lot, you will be fat. I worry about that. Don't kill yourself.

In conclusion, technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. But my opinion is this will be negative for people's lives. Because we can do nothing without technology. If we are in the house, we didn't do any communicate with family. We will get sick. I think you can do technology. But not that much. Please plan your time and use it. It will be help you. This century is technology century. But use it safe. I believe you can do it. I will try too. ",3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0

3E6C6F1FE64D,"Imagine going to school and it's your first day back from summer vacation and you walk into class with a weird impression that some teachers want to change because they know you can change the way you act or talk to other people. I think first impressions can be change because there are people that struggle to show how they feel so they have this mean impression towards people the cause of it might be parents divorce a lot and a family member passing. Some resources say that 50 percent of the population tend to give students or parents an impression that is either showing how they feel towards something.

Firstly, changing an impression might be a challenge for some people but they said its impossible to change in my reasoning I think it's possible to change someones first impression. You really can't give someone an impression if you don't know anything about them or if you don't know them. You can't always say ""oh their so mean"" until they know your background. The reason I say that is because most of the time it's true most people would give an impression towards new students at school, but they don't know anything about the person. In reality, I disagree with first impressions are almost impossible to change because you can change that impression that people tend to have on there face.

Secondly, there are other ways you can show your impressions if you don't want to show them. The first one is that you need to try to befriend them and make a conversation you never know you and that person might have a lot in common that you just didn't know to begin with. Your impression doesn't judge but it's the way you show it because sometimes it led to making new friends, having good grades, and making your own decisions in life sometimes.

Thirdly, I think impressions can change because nobody said anything about ""anything isn't impossible "" but a lot of stuff is possible if you believe there is. My reasoning to this prompt is that if you don't try hard enough to change the impression you have on your face then how can you make friends or how can you ignore what people are saying about you . Everyone can change especially their impressions you just keep trying and get to know the person.

In conclusion, I think first impressions can be change if you act right towards people and how you treat others with your impression. Nothing is impossible if your don't try to change it or if you don't try to make a way to get people to be on the same level as you in the end. So I totally disagree with this prompt for saying that first impressions are almost impossible to change. ",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0

3F3DC123EDF6,"Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble, or do they unfairly interfere in young people lives? Some people believe that debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers while others believe that is not a good idea to debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. This is important because is not a good idea to debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekday curfew for teenagers. This is going to help teenagers how to be responsible, get a job, and learn how to take care themselves.

First, teenagers have to learn how to be responsible because some teenagers do not grow up with their parents. For example, they have to go a school in the morning, and they have to go a work at night. This is important for teenagers who work and study hard. That is why is not fair that the city council debating the adoption of 10 P.M. for teenagers because they do not have some else to help them to pay bills or other stuff.

Additionally, most of the teenagers have a job at night because they want to go to the university. For example, teenagers only have time to have a job at night, and they help their parents to save money. Their is a lot of teenagers who really want to go to the university and universities are expensive. This is a big effort for teenagers that they really want to reach their own goal, and their parents do not have a lot of money to cover the bill of the university

However, not everyone agree with this position. Some people claim that debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. Nevertheless, teenagers are going to learn how to take care themselves because their are not going to live with their family all the time. For example, some teenagers take the decision to move to other state or country. And it is a good idea for them how to take care themselves without parents.

Based on this argument, one must conclude that is not a good idea to debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers because this have to be an option for teenager to do what they really want to do. Some teenagers are responsible for they own self, this help them to be prepare for their own future, and be a teenager who can protect their self in a earlier age.

3FE7AF072783,"Soccer has always been the most important priority in my life. It is not just a game but a whole different world for of its own. In the other hand, education has been also an essential part of my life. Living in a world full of competitions and challenges needs so much of a person's will power and hard work then just having an outstanding goal and not working on it. Business is something devastatingly related to education and hard work but sports are also a type of business that most of the people do not observe it.

Lionel Messi, the greatest soccer player of all time, is the person I mostly want to meet. I have always been fascinated by your skills and finishing in the field. Every teenager changes their goals for their future at least 5 times, but I have had this dream of being the greatest soccer player in the world since my first year in middle school. I can assure Messi that if he takes me to the Barcelona's beautiful stadium, I will do my best to show him how serious I am to be the greatest soccer player. I believe Messi can select me to show the true feeling of being the greatest soccer player and to let me see the most beautiful stadium of their team because soccer has always been the top priority in my life, it is not just a game but a whole different, beautiful, and unbelievable world for me, and soccer is the only game that I can play all my life without any regrets.

It was the first year in middle school that I actually understood what soccer is. Since then I have been in love with soccer. I lived in Generic_City and my parents are Asian; that is why I have had quiet some obstacles during my life because any Asian parent wants their child to study, study, and study. I was always against those who thought that sports cannot be a true career and business. I never gave up; although my parents told me hundreds of times to work on your education and study hard, but I kept it all balanced and I didn't let my parents know that soccer was always the top priority in my life. Soccer teams and opportunities in our school is important, like working hard and getting into JV was really important for me, and I will surely work hard and do my best next year to get into varsity too.

Some people believe that soccer is just a simple game which anyone can play when they have free time and have nothing to do. I totally disagree with that concept. I believe soccer has its own world. It can be a professional career and it can be a brilliant way to earn money for those who works to earn money. The first day I watched Messi's video on YouTube had me surprised that how can a person be so magnificent at controlling, dribbling, passing, and shooting. He was just perfect. There are hundreds of soccer players out there who have unbelievable and outstanding skills like: Cristiano Ronaldo, Paul Pogba, Neymar Jr, Mbappe and so many more.

Did it ever happen to you that you have played for hours and hours and your mom calls you to come home saying, ""it is enough"", but you feel like you had just started playing 10 minutes ago and how did the time went so fast? It is always the feeling I have when I play soccer. I never get tired mentally while I do get tired physically after 3 hours of playing. I want to play more and more and that feeling never gets old. That feeling shows how much you love the action you are doing. Money is one of the most crucial thing to survive in this world but if I had to choose between never ending amount of money in my bank account and freedom to play as much soccer as possible, I would gladly choose soccer.

Most of the time my imaginations are so nice that I just do not want to move and ruin it because all I imagine is me playing in professional soccer game and millions of people being my fan and I have all the skills that I wanted to have. Imaginations are nice but in real world we have to work real hard and with passion to achieve our goals. Although most of the people believe that soccer must stay as a game that anybody can play in their free time, but I completely disagree because soccer is a complete professional career for anyone who wants to play. Anybody in this world can be the greatest soccer player but the key is to work hard and challenge yourself every single day to become better. No one is perfect that is why we have to practice all the time to be better person in our lives.",4.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.5

If you try to do your best with the problem and it doen't work out you are going to make the problem even worse than it was before.

Theres a problem with your sink and you don't know how to fix.

Do it the first you try to fix it and the water leak gets worse and starts to flood your house so now you. Have to call the plumer again and pay again also you could havea called him before it started leaking again he could have walked you threw it.

Some kids have pets and when those pets pass away and there. Parents try to replace the pet with another pet it will be hard for the kid he might not eat,sleep or even talk for along time. when my dog lucky died it was hard for me and my brother we barly ate or talked my dad. Tried to get other dog be me and my brother both knew it wasn't going to be the same.

When your in school and you a kid sad and you ask him ""whats worng."" And he doen't say anything back and you start talking about coming over after school because. You have to do project with this student and you say"" ask your dad if I can come over""

then the kid starts to cry because his dad passed. Away in a car accident last night then he tells you his dad died last night you made him worse than he was 20 minutes ago just from saying one simple thing.

410D72D3CCE8,"Great people had discovered great things for us and if it was it because of them, our community wouldn't be the same. It has been said that to be yourself in a world that constantly try to make you someone else is the greatest thing yourself can do and accomplish. Personal thoughts and opinions agree with this statement and proof to be real with articles and autobiography of examples from successful people.

First one of the reasons of being yourself is better than being controlled is to think in about someone who has already accomplish something. An example can be: Nicolas Tesla, Martin Lutherking, Neil Armstrong, and Albert Einstein. They all have done a something that changed everything, not only their life but everyone's life. Being controlled by the government to go to school and do what they want will not help in life goals; to be successful the community have to achieve their goals to make a change.

Furthermore being yourself will help in self confidence and will help in life accomplishments. For example, big man with an opportunity to work with a company much superior than his, has to go to a conference to talk about bussines, his self confidence isn't really well supported and he ruined the conference because of it. All successful people have something in common and its having self confidence. It will help you in real world challenges, and being what a person is everyday is the best thing to do.

In the other hand, the community keep its way having trouble to live and following the government's ""help"". Only people with great disciplinary actions can success with this help and its why people keep following what they say to do. In Virginia there are a lot of public schools, they all teach the same thing and have the same exams. This is the same school 10 years ago and people have goals that cannot be accomplished because of school limitations.

In conclusion, Reading at all the people who has accomplished something for them and for us the key to be successful is that community have to change its way to accomplish goals and to not only depend on schools that will not teach us how to life after school is finish. Depending on government is not the way to be successful. Self confindese will make successful people as well as goals.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

First of all, people with a positive attitude can make a positive decisions on their life. Because, if a person have positive thought and attitude they can good think and they can decided to have convention with good people. And every parents wants to teach their child to have good attitude with everyone, and they wants to their child respect them. And everyone like mother, father, brother, sister, friends will proud on them.

no matter where you are going, which communication you life, just be a positive with people and with yourself it will success you.

If you work some where and you have bed attitude no body will loves you and they will never want to conversion with you. Being positive on work place.

finally, students with their positive attitude can be respect full with their teachers and other students. And also teachers will help and support them a lot.

In life one thing is more important is to keep people around you. And how you going to keep them? by having positive attitude you can keep them.

43EE2C3C7EB5,"Have you ever wondered why teachers encourage working in groups? working in a group is far more beneficial, as you get to achieve faster, work productively, as well as learn how to work together with people, and sometimes, people you don't get along with. Working in a group can help bring in more thoughts, and bigger ideas, therefore i recommend we start working in groups over working alone.

Groups help you get things done faster, as you divide up the work between the members, more things are done at once, for example; while I write up an essay about a project, someone else can design the project!

Working in groups can be more thoughtful, while the group discusses the project or work, they are able to combine thoughts and think of more ideas and make the work thoughtful. Groups are also very fun! Have you ever had to work alone and just wasted your time staring at the clock go ""tik tok tik tok"", because of how boring things are going? In groups you are able to talk to friends and discuss the project as you go along and work with people you like.

Working in groups result in a better job done, as students get to divide the work based off what their good at, helps them make the project or work better. Students in groups are able to help each other by correcting each other' mistakes they are also able to teach their group mates things they dont know as well as share ideas and thoughts together to improve the work or project being made. Often times I see students' struggle but once in group they are always there to help each other improve and that is why working in groups is helpful.

It may be argued that students could possibly not get along together in groups, however, once students are forced to work together, they are also forced to get along to achieve and succeed. Something to keep in mind is that in the future, students might have to work with people they don't like, but have to get along with in order to succeed in their job and that's why we should prepare students and teach them to get alone with people. For example; I've had times where i had to work with people that i didn't get along with, but throughout the project we had to work together productively in order to succeed and get a good grade, and since that project we are now best friends.

After all, the decision is yours but I will encourage you to start assigning groups for projects, as it will help get things productively done with less time, and it will also teach students to get along with each other, create friends, and learn how to work as a team.

However, sometime is really hard to achief that goal, some other people can't do what they want because is take alot of time and fail, when people are doing the something the same over over again, but maybe when they are change to defferent, i feel everyone go work so early on the morning make people over time feeling really tired and bord, some people work at 3 or 4 make them tired but they can't change anything because they have no choose about their life, but people can change to a different thing so they can be more better person.

People change what they do alot but also they scare if they going to fail it, alot they don't really take a other step with something new so whatever they do, people need to change the way they think about thing around them so they can make decision about they like or don't like. Everyone got a good choose or a good decision about their life but the importand is to define the choose that they make and desigh more about they decision so they can become more better, in world have a lot of famous people that make a lot of defferences about their life, a lot of story before they are become famous person, they all normal people just like everyone else but they just be themself so they become a different person when they planed their own way to go or to do on their life.

44C1594D0950,"You can be a good musician or a good soccer player but in order for you to get better at what you do,In order for you to be successful in life,In order for you to win a competition or a race you have to try to do something beyond what you have already mastered. My name is Generic_Name. I attend Generic_School and i am a student athlete,i play soccer and football and based on my experience in these sports i agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson.

I have three main reasons why i agree Author Emerson,and the first reason is to get better at what you are doing you have to take bigger steps. In order for me to get better at football and soccer, i have to try to do something beyond what i used to do. I take personal Fitness in school and my goal is to get stronger, but i cannot get stronger if i keep on lifting the same weights i can not i get stronger if am always benching the same weight.

My second reason is that, it helps you win a race or in other words it can help you win a compettion. It is just like Uber competing with lyft, they both good at what they do but in order for uber to gain more customers they have to try to do something that is beyond what they have mastered. I play as a striker in soccer and i play as conerback in football but am not the only striker on the socccer team and am not the only cornerback on the football team so in order for me to start on the team i have to work harder than i used to.

My third reason is it will help you be successful in life. I just found out that the owner of Amazon started in a garage,when i first heard i told myself that he wouldn't be successful if did not take bigger steps in life and even though he is successful he is still taking bigger steps. Also, Trump had everything he wanted cars,money, houses but still wanted to compete with Clinton for the presidency. Let's use an iphone for instance,the more they keep on upgrading it the more they gain more customers. A lot of successful entrepreneurs took bigger steps by getting a loan to start their business.

Some people will say you don't have to try to do something beyond what you have mastered,you just have to try to do new things but trying new things does not help you grow because how is adding another workout to my old workout making me stronger?,I have to increase the weight to make me stronger or how am i gaining more customers or how am i growing or how is my business growing if am still working from a garage?, in order for my business to grow or for me to gain more customers i have to take some bigger steps like getting loan to find a new place.

I agree with Author Emerson because you can be perfect in what you do,you can be perfect in life but you have to try to do something beyond what you have already mastered to keep you growing.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5

All the students should perform community service because the adults are out there working the whole day and when they come back home they want to drive on a clean community. The students when they do community service they are learning about their future life it is like a job you can't slack off. The adults don't have enough time to do community work with their job and all that but who has more free time than the students or kids . That is not all when we clean up our community our children our going to live in a clean community so help make a better future. The students may this is corny but they know too that they want their children to in a clean community and for their grandchildren. The community service could be any not just cleaning up also help tutor your neighbors child with home work and any thing out side your house helping is community service. You can babysit your neighbors kids and other peoples kids too that could count as community. The teachers could have like a game where who ever does the most community service gets like a prize of the class.

There would be like when a student gets suspended they have do community work and give him or her an hour or more time .

what kind of attempting we have to do for development? we need to have education for development that we can make our life better.

we can start our education from beginning of our life which is called school, college, university, and etc.

we should learn and keep our education in these places until we reach to our goal and success.

education is a best option for us that we can know everything, make our mistake correct, and we try to receive our diploma as soon as possible by hard studying, and every day learning the new things base on our life.

we should looking for the way that we can grow our self and do not lose our opportunity in during our life.

education is a process of life can grow your mind to better know about new stuff. this is a chance probably happen for one time, but it doesnt matter whenever you get it. basically when the students finish these process,

they will graduate, and then they will gain their diploma from any of those places after that, they will become a educated person with a high careers in their society.

45E5B6DE09E9,"One of the most frequently debated questions in today's society is whether or not first impression are possible to change. Many people argue that first impression are almost impossible to change. They say that is not possible and inevitable. I disagree with the statement. I believe that first impressions can be can be changed because we cannot judge people just by looking at them, everyone has different viewpoints, and we dont know the struggles that the other people are going through. Words can also hurt!

The first reason as to why i disagree with the statement is because we cannot judge people from first impressions. The way people act or interact is not essential information to see the intellectual development and capacity of those individuals who are being judge. There is a famous quote that says, ""Our words can sometimes hurt even more than a punch."" We all can relate to this, sometimes the words that other people use to express are very damaging and hard to listen; even when is just a silly joke that one of your friends is saying.

Nevertheless, everyone has different perspectives and view points, but just because we may think differently, doesn't mean we have to get driven by our perceptions or speculations. There are millions of people in this planet, and every single one of us think and look different. We are all not the same. The complementary diversity we have nowadays is a great example of this. It is good to have a great range of diversity, but the race we all come from cannot define us, nor the judgments that other people make from us.

The last and final reason is that we don't know the struggles that the other person is going through. Sometimes, we may look tired, weary, or even depressed. Sometimes we are having problems with our families or with our own selves. The judgments we make can potentially affect those individuals life. Sometime we make decisions without thinking about consequences or how those decisions are going to impact others. Decisions, such as the judgments from different speculations we make.

As you have read, I disagree with the statement. I believe that the judgment from our first impressions is not inevitable. We are capable to change our own perception from other people that can potentially affect their lives throughout the struggles that he or she may be facing.",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0
46E550A148DF,"Thomas Jefferson wrote that ""Determine never to be idle.. It wonderful how much may ti be done if we are always doing"". He think about that person have to be determine to do have the focus in something, But I think that it is not a good idea have the focus in something Because Everyone need to have time for their own, Also maybe try something different or find another way to do it, And maybe some plans have a lot of frustration and mental problems.

First, Every person should have time for their own because having time to relax have help to have the focus later, Also have free time you can have fun, playing videogames, dancing, singing, or meet somebody, and have time with the family or just time to sleep can be a great help for a person. I think is very important have time ourown because something we don't pay attention what happen around us, or just can be tired for everyone.

Second, try something new can be a good idea to have a brain storm, To really find what you or what we want to do to have all the success like Tesla of SpaceX, They are traying a lot of different things, Maybe be idle can be good sometimes and be determine but Is not a good idea.

In addition, a lot of person think same like Jefferson that is a good idea be determine to do somethinng and They want to be expert in that thing , and great for They, But I think detemine to do something can have a lot of problems sometimes like frustration problems. Just imagine a person, That spend a lot of time in here determine think to do, But something really bad happen, And that work, that this person dedicate a lot of effort, and dedication, just go away and that can cause psychologist problem, Like the Real Madrid, They wogsrk very hard all season and they make a plan but everyone see what happen, nothing work and just their season just end 3 month before finish. So I think have all the focus in just one think can have a lot of problems.

In conclusion, I think is very hard to say that be determine in something can cause a lot of problems like frustration or depression, And also is important to have to ourown or our family, friends, or pets, and try new things or cool thing is always is good, Never is good to do same always just you have you own thinking or own critical.",3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
4744A861D13F,"It has been said that first impression are impossible to change. Based on my experience, I totally disagree with this statement. Here is my reasons why I disagree first impression are impossible to change.

First, When you get to know a person, you always have a first impression on them. It could be negative or positive; however, it could change over time. For example, when I met my best friend for the first time, I had a bad impression on him. I thought he was serious and boring but it turns out he was actually fun to be around with and joyful.

Secondly, It's not the same knowing the person for the first time than knowing the person for a long period of time. For example, people don't have the confidence of showing their selves when they meet the person for the first time. Although they are cases that first impression stays the same; however, it could change depend on how the person treats them.

In conclusion, first impression could always change based on how you act. You need to get to know the person more to be able to change thier first impression. And here are my reason on why I disagree first impression are impossible to change.",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5

48ADCBFC8376,"Do you think Students should know what career they want by the time they""re in high school? I don't think so because students will feel pressured and probably won't know what they want to do until after of high school. But some argue that students should know what to do while in high school. In my opinion, students should not feel rushed on their career because students would feel pressured and students probably won't know what to do until after they get out of high school. although, some would argue that students would be well prepared to study that job during high school.

My first example is that students should take their time. If students take their time and still think about it, they can have different options. Instead of pressuring them they should let them learn new things in school because they can check out a lot of different jobs they can be interested in and take it after school . Another thing is that students can focus more on their school work, education, and focus on graduating. Some students cant focus on careers during high school because they need to figure out what classes they have to take and pass in order to graduate from high school, and then focus on a career. So I think students should take their time on their own pace and figure it out little by little.

My second example is that students wont figure it out until after high school and if needed, take some time of from school . Students if they choose a career after school they can focus on that specific job and not worry about anything else besides their interest. they can focus more on their career that they chose because they dont focus on anything else school related, and give their full on attentions to their job. One other thing is that students after high school will feel less stressed and more relaxed. they can take however much time off on thinking what job to get.

Whenever they are ready to get a job they go to collage and study for it. I think students should feel stress free.

Some would argue that students should know what to do career they want to do during high school. For example students will know what to study for, before they get that job. Also, they can be well prepared and learn a lot of new things for the job. Sure students can be well prepared and learn about the job way before. however, students shouldnt have a lot of stress on them with school and their future career at the same time. Also, students grades will probably dramaticly go down because they try to focus on both things.

In conclusion, I think that students should not feel rushed. They will feel pressured and wont know until maybe after school. But some people think that they should know while in high school because they will be prepared confident for the job. I dont think that they should stress themselves a lot. so that they can focus on their education and focus on graduating and make their family proud.

There body will be able to preform better as there brain. For example, if a student eats vegetable he/she will have much more clear blood than a student who eats meat.

Next, foods that are healthier will have a huge impact on students performance. If a student keeps eating unhealthy food they will constantly be tired and will not be able to perform as well as possible, but healthier food helps the students to perform better and get better grades.

Next, the healthier food means a healthier body which leads to looking good and keeps you away from going to doctor as often as a person who eats unhealthy food. Getting in shape doesn't mean working out, you must eat healthy to be in a good shape. Also, Students will not be sick as often which means that they will not need to visit doctors more often.

First you can get help with your work. the teacher can help you if you dont understand your work. If your having trouble with your work the teachers or students can help you and they will show you how to do it. The teachers will explain how your making mistakes. some students may not have a good home and the may not be able to complete there assignments because of the fact that they dont have supplies to complete there work so the teachers and students can help the student who needs help.

Second many students get low grades due to incomplete homework. In the club the students complete homework then turn it in the next day. students will turn homework in on time everyday. Students can work on classwork, projects, and homework. students can complet homework early so they will not do it on the last day.

Finaly other students can volunteer to help students. Students can get rewards for helping others. students can particpate for class grades. Both students learn from working together. They learn there mistakes and correct each others papers.

In concluson i think starting an after school homework club is a good idea heres why. You can get help with your work and many students will not have low grades due to incomplete homework.

I think schools should follow these businesses model by extending the school day two hours and adopt a four-day school week. Although the students might hate the hour extensions, they would love to have a four-day school week. However, there are a lot of benefits and disadvantages in this model.

Lots of students would agree to having a four-day school week. There are a lot of benefits for students if they only have to come for school for four days. Students would have extra time to finish their homework, they would also get some more time to spend with their family, and would be able to travel for an extra day. Students could get a lot of things done with that extra day they get off if they only have a four-day school week. Even though the model comes with lots of benefits there are also lots of disadvantage with it as well.

Students might not like having to stay in school for an extra two hours. This is a huge disadvantage because some students have after school jobs they might not be able to attend if school hours got extended. Other students might have to take care of their families after school. Extending school hours would be a disadvantage to everyone because it will most likely mess up schedules. If school hours got extended students might not be able to find jobs that work with their schedules. The school should think about having a four-day school week but shouldn't extend the school day two hours.

The model has its ups and downs, advantages and disadvantages but its still a good model. Students would love to only be in school for four days. They would probably hate having to stay for extra two hours so the school shouldn't do that. The four-day school week give a lot of benefit to the students.

If the students pick online learnig the teachers can be fake a pretend to teach the kids when they do not know anything. The video conferencing can get messed up by the internet because some people might have slow connection or no connection at all.

It would be easier for students because they will learn more at school then the video chat, or from online. Some students have a slower learning abilities then others. The students are learning by one teacher from the video chat some students will be done much quicker then the other students. At school th teachers wait for the other students finish then they let the rest of class to do other work. It will not help the students to learn from home because at home is where they have their games tv all of that stuff they will pretend to be doing work, but actually they will be doing other adn stuff and they will tell the teachers that they already finished the work.

Students needs someone who has a degree in teaching. It will be easier for the teachers because they will know what things they have to teach to the certain type of students. They would know how to teach it to them and it will be easier for them to learn the topic. It is easier to go to school becuase we will learn the topic with other students and students can ask for help from their friends or the the teachers in class.

The teachers on video chat can be a random person off the streets and teach the student the wrong infomation. Also it will cost a lot of money for the students learn from a video chat. Schools are free, so the students can go there and get education for free, nor the students, or parents have to pay. Some parents, nor students can afford online classes because it costs like over one hundred dollars.

Staying home and doing online classes is fun because we are able to stay in our night clothes and do school work. Students can get their blankets and anything they want and do work while being comfortable. The students do not have to get up and go to school. They can get up at anytime and do class work.

4CFAF19AF547,"Technology has it ups and downs with some being useful to use humans and some being harmful and destructive. Has technology come to a point where we need to use it in our everyday life or has it become where we don't even need it because we're to lazy to do thing ourselves. I think that limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has had many negative effect on people's lives because it can cause depression or isolation, can cause some people to lose their touch of reality, and can harm your physical or mental health. Likewise, technology can cause many harmful things.

In other words, technology can cause depression or isolation can really be very bad situation especially if you have both. Depression can be caused by technology because many kids around the world get bullied through social media ,and some get very emotionally depressed. That's when kids want to isolate themselves and don't go to school. Many people around the world like playing video games, and some are very into it that they don't even know that they are isolating themselves from everyone around them. Most people around the world have a phone, a cellular device, and use it all day and don't even come out once. Technology can cause a big impact on people's life and causes them to have depression.

Consequently, technology can also make people lose their touch with reality. Some people can easily manipulate other through the internet. At a young age kid like to TV, YouTube video ,and things like that, and many kids if not all are very gullible. Many videos on YouTube can make kids believed something thats is not true or even brainwash them. Adults also can get brain washed through the Internet. Many conspiracy theories say that the government are trying to brainwash people with technological advancement machine and many to believe that it's not true. Some people even get brainwashed by playing so many video game at a young age, and believe what they do in a games is what they can in real life.

Additionally, as technology keeps on progressing it's just going to keep on getting worse for our physical and/or mental health. Eye doctors say that if your always on a device and it will effect your vision. Technology can mental change you as a person because some people want to be like someone on the internet and change the way they dress and even in some situations their personality. In some cases people have watch many videos of people doing very dangerous stunt. Some people actually try and attempt the same stunt they saw on the video and fail miserably and end up going to the hospital.

In the other hand, technology can come and be useful. It can also safe peoples lives in a situation where someones life is at risk. Technology can also come in handy for us to win wars. It's usefulness can make someones life way more efficient. Technology just overall makes like so much simple and easy. People don't even have to stress about thing as much as they used to anymore because of technology. Technological advancement can change the world as we know it. However, technology can malfunction anytime or anywhere. Technology advancement machine can be the cause of someones death. People might think that technology is going to make life easier, but it's only gong to get harder. If people just let technological advancement machine do everything for them their physical health is just going to plummet down because people are not getting the exercise they need. Also people need to understand technology is getting in the way of something beautiful, the Earth. Technology is causing pollution around the world and killing our home.

Overall, technology is causing all these horrific things to use and we don't even know it until we look around use. I personally think that limitation of human contact to the use of technology can have a negative outcome on people's lives because can cause people to lose they're touch with the outside world, can cause depression or isolation, and can a severe effect and people's physical or mental health. So, technology can be ignored but it will never go away.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5
4D3CF318797A,"Technology has came a long way of the past hundreds of years. Technology has made so many things possible for us humans, we took a man to the moon because of technology. But technology also, has its pros and cons. Us as humans, we're depending on technology way too much. People are buy clothes, and buying food without having to talk to another person.

Technology has made it so easy for people to buy things online. You can be sitting on your couch, pull out your phone, and order bananas, hammers, and a eagles beak. The next day, a drone will fly to your house and deliver it right on your door step. We don't have to leave our houses anymore, or talk to anyone. We're able to do this because, of the use of technology.

People don't even have to leave their house anymore to see someone. You can pull out your phone, and live video chat with anyone you want to see. Some people might think that's a good thing, that we'll never leave our houses again. But us as humans, we need that human interaction. Without having to leave our houses how can we travel the world, or even meet our soul mate. we're not going to be able to do that sort of things, if technology is just making everything so easy for us.

There are ways that technology is helping us like transportation, and constructing buildings. But the limitation of human contact, is due to the use of technology. We need to stop depending on technology to do simple task for us. This needs to stop before it becomes normal for people to do these sorts of things.                  ",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5

4EE0B81B9133,"You are in trouble. As your teachers might tell you, behave when you are in school. That includes in the halls, cafeteria, and even on the school bus. By following simple rule that are established for your safety, you won't lose your school staff's trust.

Behave when you are in the halls. when the bell rings, and you are dismissed, go to your other class immediately. Don't take a walk around the school, go to the gym, or cause a traffic by standing in the halls and talking to your friends. It's not a safe nether is it responsible. Keep your hands to your self, unless if it's an activity that allowed you to touch the other students or even staff members with adult supervision.

Behave in the cafeteria. Once you are in line to get your food, you should respect others by waiting your turn. This isn't only respectful, but it's even a good habit. Walk back to your seat, don't run. Running could cause for you to spill your food, and someone could slip and that resulting in an injury. When you finish your food, cleanup after your self if necessary.

Behave when you are on the school bus. When you are on the bus it's nice of you to greet your bus drive, but you don't have to. Quietly walk to an open seat and sit down. Sit with your grade level. Once settled, you could quietly talk to the person sitting next to you, don't yell across the bus. On the bus it is important for the bus driver to be able to see from the back window or door to prevent car accidents, don't put your stuff in the middle of walkway. If you are going to be eating on the bus, which you are not aloud, unless the bus driver said so, clean up any mess that you may have caused.

Showing responsible and appropriate behaviors could make teachers more flexible with any other improper behavior that you may cause. For an example, you are a bad student, you were late to class, and you decided to run. The teacher catches you, and you get in trouble. Example two, you are a good student, you were late to class, the bell rings but you don't run, the teacher forgives you.

No wonder so many of us are depressed, they see what other people have but to blind to see what they have is important. Everyone sees the same thing but have a different perspective.

Time wasting is a big one. Peoples eyes are glued to there own personal screen. Sheeple. They care about the new, the best, the bad, and the ugly. They only care about themselves and there phones and shirts with a red bar that says supreme in white text.

4FFF2AD2EAE8,"Have you ever had a subject that you liked or you know it so well? If I

had a chance to talk to a elementary school, I will teach them about English. The reason why I would chose English because you will need to know it throughout you whole life, you need to know how to use correct grammar, and its easy to learn. English is fun and easy to use whenever you need it.

First, If you live in

America you will need to know the basic language and thats English, you will use English throughout your whole life. In school you will start learning English in preschool and it goes throughout your whole life. When people come from other places that are not in America some people have trouble speaking English because they have not learned about it. So if you have not learned it when you were young it going to really hard for you to understand. When you get older and you have a job you will need to talk to people and you will need to know how to write and type. Even though if you dont have a job you will still need to learn how to speak English. When you need to do important work for the government or tax work, you need to sign and write you information. In real life if theres an emergencies and you well need to talk to someone you will need to learn how to speak English. Finally, English will be with you fro your whole life and it helpful if you know how to speak it.

Second, one of the biggest thing you will need to know in life is how to write in English. In life there are going to so much times where you need to write you name and the date. When you get older you will need to learn how to write your address and make sure that grammar is correct like commas, period, and spelling arrows. Also, will need it when your in school you well need it everyday by writing your name to writing a whole essay and it needs to not have any grammar problems. You will also need when you have a job and if you become a teacher you will need to learn the more detail information. When there is important information that you will need to sign your address, you will need to add commas and that involves you learning English. Finally, this is the reason why its important to learn English because you will need to know the grammar to it.

Third, English is the easiest to learn because if you get how to write you will know it for your whole life. If you learn how to use commas and other things then you will learn it for your whole life. There is three things that you will need for English and it how to speak, or write, and grammar. You will need those things for essay projects and more. It is easy to learn because you are using it for your whole life over and over and when you do things over and over and it gets stuck in your head. English is also fun because when you get something it makes you feel good. You might not know but you are using everyday even if there is now school you are texting or writing a letter. This is another reasons why I would like yo teach a class about English because it easy and at the same time its fun.

Last, these are all the reasons what I will teach a elementary school about English because your whole life depends on you speaking English, you will need to learn how to write in English, and it easy an easy subject to learn. First, speaking English is not really hard and it will become really useful. Learning how to speak English your life will move slowly because you dont have to worry about someone else talking for you your whole life. Second, you would even know that your using English but you are because you are always typing or writing and you will need to learn English to be able to do that. Last, the easiest subject to learn is English because when you get it you will always use it. English is and amazing way to learn how to speak and it can be fun.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

It has been said that 1st Impressions are almost impossible to change. This statement to me is wrong. Impressions can be changed not only because people always mature in life, but also people may change by others actions, and they way life treats one another.

Impressions can be changed because people mature in life. For example, my mother tells me all the time that I was not the same kid she raised because of my appearance and the way I act around others. So, it is because I have matured that I have changed, if I was 7 or 8 years old, I would be shay to talk to people and try to be polite to not cause problems. Also, people would never smoke or even talk back if their impressions matter like they did when they were little. So peoples impressions change when you get mature in life

Impressions can be changed because of the people around them. For example, my little brother may not do all the things that he does now if it weren't for my behavior around others, back then my little brother would be very shay to speak. Then he saw how I spoke to others; with security, courage, and calm. He learned that from me and now he talks to anyone he enjoys hanging out with. So, with people being and influence in someones life, you would make a good or a bad impacted on someone's life which would change someone's impression for sure.

Impressions can be changed because the way life treats one another. For example, a week from my birthday I was going to turn 14 my dad got arrested; I did not feel like I wanted to throw a party, I hated everything cause I said to my self life isn't fair, Then the next morning in school, every ones impression of was that I never felt sad, I was a happy young teen; Until the next day everyone was wishing me a happy early birthday. I didn't feel happy about it because my mind was all caught up on my fathers arrest. People noticed that and their impression changed because I never felt happy in my life, everything went wrong. Instead of everyone greeting me every morning, they just gave me space because they thought that I was depressed and I was for a good time. Now people take me seriously now because I didnt make jokes. So peoples impression changes ever since they saw the way life wasn't fair.

In conclusion, It has been said that 1st Impressions are almost impossible to change. This statement to me is wrong. Impressions can be changed not only because people always mature in life, but also people may change by others actions, and they way life treats one another. All of these reasons are true because no one really knows what life, maturity, and the people around you can do to affect someone's 1st impressions of you.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5
519A1A92C8C8,"Success consist of going from failure to failure withouth loss of enthusiasm, and I'm agree with this statement, because can do what it wants if try and try, and everything is doing with effort , and than a failure can be for a better oportunity in the future.

Did you heard that failured means success sometime? well effort is the best way that you can reach what you wish. Can do what it wants if try and try, so let me tell you something about a friend that is close to me, and he was in failre to failure, so one time he came to me and he told me his problems, and than he cry and I tell him, ""don't worry everything will be okay"", and than he said - I'm gonna try again this is the second time that I failure, and I will try again until to have what I want, and I tell him that I always will be there for him, because he is my friend and the friend is to be there for each other when it need, and then two years later he told me that he finally has what he was trying to do in the pass and he was very happy and I was happy too. If my friend didn't try he were unhappy, and maybe he were a miserable person, but he were strong and he did it.

do you know ""what you can do with effort"", means? effort is something that it has to be preasent in your life everything is made it with effort, when I was 14 years old I was in my country, I was in 9th grade, and my friends and I was happy for our graduation, but I was acared because we had a final exam and the exam was about my country history, but is not that simple because I had to know a book of 6 parragraph, and some of the parragraph is like 10 sentences each, and I had to tell to the principal the antire book, so and then I had to learn 50 question about my country that it comes in the book too, so I had to take the test writing about this 50 question, but I already took one and I fail, and I was scared about it, but I tell my self you can do it, you have to pass, and I was studying averyday after school at my home, with my friends, and sometimes my counsins help me how to do it, or they help me to learn; they asking me the questions to know if I knew correctly each question and answer, so the day of the test I was a little scared and nervios, because I feel I will forget everything, and finally it was my turn, and I did it right I was so happy with myself because it was hard, I put all my effort in this test and I did it, and my frinds and I graduate at the same time. If I were lazy and not interest in to pass this exam maybe I had to repeat the school year and I were disappointed with my self.

A failure can be for a better opportunity in the future. Now I come with a anecdote of my uncle Generic_Name that already died he was illiterate, and his job was the security in a night club, and that was his job in his entire life, and one day the boss went with new rules for everyone, and his boss tell him his job

-you have to write the number and the name of the people that come in the nightclub every day, and my uncle tell to his boss

-I would like to do that Sr. but I can not read and write I'm illiterate and I can not do what you are asking for my Sr. his boss tell him

-I'm so sorry Generic_Name but if it is like that you can not work anymore here, and my uncle Generic_Name answer,

-but what I'm going to do I can not do anything else this was my job in my entire life. His boss said,

-I'm sorry Generic_Name. And then my uncle left the place he was upset telling to himself what I'm goin to do I need a job, and he remerber that he fix the chairs of the night club, and he said

-I can do that in the town and earn some money just for my food , and he went to his house and find some nail and tools, but that was not anough, and he had some save money and he went to the city to buy what he needs; the way to get to the city was two days in mule and when he come back to the town the next day his neighborhood went to his house and told to my uncle

-you have a hammer that I can borrow,

and my uncle tell him

-Yes! but I can't borrow you my hammer, because I need it I have to work, and his neighborhood said

-Please I can bring you tomorrow in the morning,

and my uncle puzzling said

-Ok!

At the next day his neighborhood tell to my uncle

-where did you buy this hammer because is really good can I give you the money and you can go buy other one for you,

and my uncle said

-well it's okay I'm going tomorrow in the morning,

the other neighborhood knew that he will go to the city to buy some things and they ask if he can bring things to them, and they will pay extra money, and he tell them

- okay no problem I'm come back in two day then he were thinking about how he will earn money doing travels to the city, and buying things for the other people in the town, so he decide that will be his job and than he did it, and earn enough money that he ask to the store but a truck come to drope the merchandise to his house, and like that he were improve his little store in the town than he remerber one of his friend can make tools and like that they fabricate the tools and they find more people to make it too, and little by little he make a a big hardware it was the first hardware in the town; the day to open for the first time his hardware someone ask him to sing in the book and he said

- I would like to sing, but I can not read and write, and the man said

- WHAT! I can not believe that Sr. if you made this factore been illiterate what would you do if you could read and write, and he asnwer maybe I keep my old job and I still were a security of a night club. if my uncle didn't try to find some job for himself he didn't reach all the he had at that time.

5241864FBC48,"My Grandma always use to say that ""working with a group is fun and all, but at the end of the day, I would have to understand what the group activity was about, but at the same time working with a group can get more work done and we help each other."" She explained to me that there isn't group work when it comes down to taking a test or quiz. Students are always sitting down and learning maybe getting up and working with a couple of classmates can help learn too. I'm the one in a seat answering the questions on a test or quiz. There is no group work involved when it comes down to that. I think working alone and working as a group can both be beneficial.

First when working in a group I can understand my classmates more than my teacher. I can understand more especially if a student just like me explains everything. I might not understand somethings or tend to forget, however someone in my group could know or refresh my memory by giving me notes, or vise versa. I can get a ton of work done as a group, but do I really understand what I just did. For example, say we have a group of five students, three of them are constantly talking, the other two students are the only ones in the group that are actually doing the work. The grade that the group received was a 95. If the students are quizzed on what they have just completed, the students that were talkative are most likely to get a lower grade than the two students that were actually doing the activity without getting off topic.

Second when working alone there are no distractions. I would get my work done peacefully, at a rate I would like to go. I would not get as much work done as if I was in a group, but the teacher would know that it's all my work. For example, say I'm working with a group, we get a 93 for the whole group work. I received a quiz on what we just did and I got a 78. After that performance, the teacher gave me notes and went over the same material with me. I studied; and I took the quiz again. This time I got a 90. Therefor, this goes to show that working alone helps the teacher figure out what you need help on.

Some people say that working in a group can cause fights,distractions, and poor quality work ethic. I feel like working alone is more beneficial. Everything can not be done in a group. Sometimes you have to work alone to fully grasp the subject. Working alone lets your brain process better especially at it's own rate. The teacher can really see what you need help on.

In conclusion, I think that both working in a group and working alone are beneficial. I think that working alone is more beneficial because everyone works and really understands the subject at a different pace. Working in a group does not show the teacher a specific person's work. Thats why I think working alone can better help yourself and is more beneficial.              ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5

52F9582F9C86,"Every student should have the opportunity to be involved in extracurricular activities for them to enrich their educational experiences. Here are some reasons why they should be involved in activities, when they're involved in activities they have the opportunity to do different kind of stuff outside home, school, and even work. They also learn how to be independent and responsible. Also being in extracurricular activities could also help the students health.

First, when students are involved in activities outside school and home, it gives them the chance to experience different things outside school, home, or even work. They learn different kind of things. Things they wouldn't learn in school. For example during school they learn about math, science, history, and english. When they're home they do nothing but homework and help around the house some students have to work. If they're involved in activities, they have the opportunity to experience different kind of stuff for example: if a student decided to do a sport they would learn about that certain sport and they would also play it and enjoy it with a team. If they play a sport they would have to also practice at home, but not verse others or be in a team to practice with.

Second, students learn how to be more independent when involved in activities. For example, when I decided to join figure skating I wasn't independent, I didn't really know how to do things by myself, and when I joined at first it was kind of hard because I needed help with everything but as time passed by I started to learn how to be more dependent. I started doing almost everything by myself without any help, I was more dependent at home, school, and figured skating. Being involved in this activity, also taught me how to be more responsible. When doing activities you need to learn how to use your time wisely because you will need time for school, homework, family, and the activity you're involved in. Being involved in an activity is a good way to learn how to be responsible, how to be independent, and how to manage your time wisely.

Last, joining an activity can help with your mental and physical health specially if its a sport. Joining an activity is a good way to distract yourself from school, home, or work. This is because you will be thinking about the rules of the activity or about the point of that certain activity. It also helps your physical help meaning that it helps you exercise and it helps your body do what it needs to do. Being involved in a sport is a good way to help you exercise and distract yourself from other things. Being involved in activities such as sports or school clubs allows you to enjoy that time. If its something you really like then its something you can look forward to after having a bad day or a stressful day. When I had a bad day I would always think about skating and what I should do to make my jumps better. I would also go to the skating ring and practice, this helped me be more active and helped my physical health too. Being involved in a sport or any other activities is a good way to help students look forward for things.

Some people may argue that schools should control student involvement in extracurricular activities because some students don't have time to do school assignments but that shouldn't be their problem, that would be the students problem because students should know that if they join more than one activity they will still need to do school assignments such as homework or projects. Students should learn how to manage their time and use it wisely. Students and families should control the student involvement in extracurricular activities.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5
54099C3AE7CE,"My Talent

Imagine,

having an amazing talent or skill but no one knows about it. Some people might say that hiding your talent is wrong but I think that it helps me to focus more and to develop it better. Singing is my talent , I love singing

I develop it by practicing and I use it by writing my own songs .

First of all , I love singing , my Talent, which i develop by practicing.

For example , I am always looking videos up to develop my voice and practice but sometimes I practice on my own.

The more I practice the easier is going to be for me to sing without any help, For me developing my talent is really important because my talent is my dream .

Another example is that I go to singing lessons to practice and develop my voice , sometimes they give you some notes that you can use to practice at home , with the notes they give you, your voice is eventually going to sound clear focus and mature.

Furthermore, I use my talent by writing my own songs , when I my own songs the writing will give me an extra writing skill and most of the time some old memories come back.

For instance , I usually write about my old memories , old feelings or the way i am feeling at the moment. Another instance , writing my own songs will give me an extra writing skill.

By writing all the time you learn new techniques , new ways of writing or new lyrics.

In closing , i use my talent by writing songs and that gives me extra writing skills , i develop my talent by looking up videos and by going to singing lessons . Also, my talent is my dream so i usually put a lot of effort on it .",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0
5494132B7229,"Is better for students that are entering high school to know what they want to do after they finish high school? some pleople will say yes but some will say no and they are not wrong or right anwer in thise question is depending in your point of view and how fast you want to achive your goal and how good you want to be in your carrer and work.

The people that say yes they say that because when you know what career you want to take before entering high school you wiil choose you classes better depending in your career and what high school you want to attend because come schools have programs that count like college classes, and in high school you have only four years and that is not enough time for you to choose and you will end up in a carrer that you don't like if you choose the wrong one. If you know what you want to be you will cofus better in that career . You can join programs to help you more in your goals and when you know your goals you can achive them better. You also will try to see how can you get a scholarchip for your carrer and what college are better for you, and you will mead people that like the same thing as you and you can make friends. When you join programs some time you can get a scholarchip if you are good. For example my friend want to join the army so he is taking jrotc to help hem do better in the army but my other friend wants to do soccer for college so he is taking advance p. e. to be in shape and he is also in the school team to get a scholarchip, and me I'm taking business classes to help me know more about business marketing because I want to put my own store and Im putting everything of me to do that because that is my goal and i want to do the best of me in that project of my life.

People that say that you don't have to know what you want to be before you get in to high school. They say that you can join different programs and see wich one you like the most and you will choose your career from that decition and you will know what's about because some people choose careers that they don't like them maybe because they dind't know the stuff you have to do or they dind't expect to be like that. Is better to waste four years then wasting your entire live in a career that you don't like. you sholl try to get a scholarchip that way you don't pay for college.

If you dind't have a scholarchip and finish college and you are working in a career that you don't like and you dind't have a sholarchip you are going to be in debt and you are going to pay alot. If you only study for one year in college and you fell like that career is not for you you have to play for that year and is not cheap so you have to choose your career when you are in high school and see what's about before entering and if you like it because if you don't like that career you are going to waste your time. For example I dind't know what career I like before high school so I join jrotc and i dind't like it and a teacher told me to take business classes and I like it so I chose to do business for my career.

In conclution both of them are good options but if you know what you want to be before high school you can see what's that carrer is about in high school and if you dont like it you can change it and the other one you will have more chooses because you will not focus in only one career you will see more oportunitis. Is depending in the choose you make. All of thise dipend in how you are because evryone is defferent and not everyone is going for the same opsion. But for both of them you have to do your best in school to achive your goal and get a schoolarchip that way you dont pay for college. But first of all we have to finish high school and get good greads. and remember that is only one life so do your best and try to live the life that you want and don't let others tell you that you can't do something just belive in your self and that will be a big change adn wen you are in college do your best and do your work and life the live chill.",3.5,2.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0
56C4259AA5C2,"Is always good to try new ideas, I disagree with Emerson's statement. Nobody can tell you if you can do something or if you can't, the unique that can stop you is yourself. Learning new thinks help us to recreate our minds, help us to make new projects in life or work, help us to create new ideas and most of the time we can have fun. Also try to do something more besides you career will help you to have more options of work and more possibility to have a better economic situation.

In fact, it will help you to be responsible in all the staff that you do daily, in your home, in your job, in the school, with you friends, etc. It will prepare you for what is coming in the future and it will help you get mature mentally.

However, take two or more careers at the same time can harm you, and make harder you progress in your main career. For example: I got a friend his name is Generic_Name, he's taking film producer career, he needs to take those classes for almost three more years. In addittion, he started to do photography career like two months ago. He really like both careers, and Generic_Name think that if he take both careers at the same time it would be easy in the future for get a better work and make more money. But he realize that it will be really hard to do both careers at the same time, he began to feel the stress and the pressure that he will no do it really good on both careers. He realize that it was really complicated and that he was losting his time and his money on something that it wouldn't end really good.

Then my recommendation was to finish first film producer career because it was the career that he really wants to finish first, it was his dream to be a film producer and make some movies, we always talked about this. So I said first you need to finish film producer career and after that, it will be better to take photography career like second choice. Anyways, Generic_Name was really frustrated because he thought that he will do it really well, but his mistake was that he didn't organize his time and his life; that's what happen with most of the people that think that do more than one career is impossible, and is not that, is just that you need to organize yourself and your time. After that Generic_Name understood that do easch career at the time it would be better and he decided to start with film producer first and add Photography career after two more years.

In Conclusion, take two different careers or masters are not a problem, you just need to organize your life and check what is the priority for you, it doesn't matter how long you take, in a future you will see all the benefits that you are going to have, how you grow up and how you can be an example for other people that think ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have alredy mastered, you will never grow up"", if you try to do something beyond what yopu have already mastered it probably being easier, but that doesn't mean that if you do another career you will not be a successful person. Finally you just need to demostrate that you effort and you sacrifice is going to be for something better in your life.",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

5828FAC247DF,"Should student commit their career at a young age ?

In this statement i will argue if student should commit to chopse their career at a young age. In my opinion, i think student should think about their career at a young age. First reason why they should think about their career is because they could know some step of how to get into their career. They woukd know some steps on what to study or in other words know what classes are the right one to take. An example is that when i was in high school i didn't know what to study for. my teachers couldn't find the right classes for me to take. Most student get into high school without knowing what they would want to study for. Another example was that when i got into high school they ask me for my career i told them what i wanted to be. Once i got into 10 grade i change my mind and decided to change my career. When i try to get into my step for my second career it was already too late to apply which made me now find my own way to get into the career i wanted to be in. Most student get into high school with out knowing what they want to study for. Another reason is that when they don't know what to study for as their career, They don't find a way after in how to get into collage. It is always a good first step as a high schoolar to know what they want to be. Last exapmple is that i didn't think about my career when i was in middle school and now in my high school year i didn't get into any of my career i wanted to study for. When you know what you want your career to be teachers help you get the right classes. Teachers also help you get into the collage you want to study for your career. Some people think knowing what they want to study for before going to high school is just a rush thing for them. People be saying it's too early to know or think about your career. In my conclusion, Most student should know at their young age what they wanna be. My advice to all the young student making their way to high school they should start thinking what they want to be. When they get into high school they will know what to do, how to apply and they would know what classes are just right for them to take for their career.",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5
584A4BB1E954,"Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed ? I think students should designed. students can do this well.

One reason why summer projects from students. Because if the student designed their project they can choose their projects. For example, some students need an essay project but teachers give harder projects for students and they can't do this projects. And some students not have idea about the projects from teachers but when students choose their projects they have good ideas about their projects. However, some teachers did not like to students choose their projects .This is not the only reason summer projects from students is good.

Some may argue summer projects from teachers is good. This is because the teachers have more information about summer projects and they know what kind of projects is better for students. However, some students not have information about summer projects and they did not like to complete the summer projects from teachers in the summer.

In conclusion, I think the students need to choose their projects because if they choose their projects they like the summer projects and they really want to complete their projects in the summer vacation and they have good ideas about the projects.",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0

Students would not benefit from being able to attent classes from home because: students would not have a social communication with their classmates, students would not ask questions to the teacher for help when they need it, and students would not participate in class activies or projects.

Firstly, students would not have a social communication with their classmates because students are taking classes at home, there is not a way to meet new friends. For example, in the school students would know different types of people, races,and cultures. Also, students would know each other, share special moments, and have a friendship. Secondly, students would not be able to ask questions to the teacher because they are at home, taking classes online, sometimes students get confused or they have some question but they can not ask to the teacher. For example, students do not understand something, it is hard for them to ask about it because there is not a teacher who would answer all the questions that they need or if they are doing a homework and they get confused, it would be hard for them to finish it because they do not know if they are doing right or wrong their homework. Thirdly, students would not be able to participate in class activities or projects because they are taking classes by themselves at home. For example, in the school, students can work in groups projects, expositions, and activies. Moreover, when students work in groups, they can learn how other students work, the tecniques that they use and skill that they have.

In contrast, some students would benefit for taking classes online from home because, students feel safety at home, some students live far away of the school and they do not have transportation. Also, some students have jobs and other responsablities.

58F6D70A2DC7,"Should the city council adopt the 10:00 P.M. curfew?

Curfews keep teenagers out of trouble because it keeps most of the teenagers by not sneaking out of their houses, and not getting into bad habits.

The curfew would keep teenagers safe by the increase of robberies.

The curfew would save teenagers out of trouble by not letting teenagers go outside by them selves. The curfew helps teenagers feel safe that they would be no one in the streets.

When teenagers are left home alone, they get scared because they are by themselves and they are afraid that someone would break into their house. Most house robberies occur at night and it makes teenagers worry that robberies can take place anywhere. Teenagers regret going anywhere at night because of the curfew and robbers. Some teenagers does not like going outside at night when there is a curfew because they don't want to break the law, and they don't want to get kidnapped. Some teenagers won't go outside either because they are scared of dark, and that kidnappers with catch them, because robbers and kidnappers are often out in midnight.

5AC1AB0965F6,"Ever since I was little I would dreamed of going to Hawaii. I would always think of seeing the beautiful crystal clear blue seas. I would want to go scuba diving and get a view of the animals in the ocean.

reasons why I would want to go to Hawaii because it has a huge water park. I always have fun at water parks because it has big slides and big pools and other fun stuff. But Hawaii water park is like three times the size of the water parks I've been in. During the summer I like to go to my pool and spend my time there. I always wished I had a slide in my pool. But my pool is still fun. I invite my friends to make the pool more fun. We play sharks and Minos and other games.

Another reason why I would go to Hawaii is because I want to try out their sea food. I heard their sea food is really good and it come fresh out the ocean. Personally my favorite sea food is crab. But i like crab better when its a crab soup.

One more important reason why I would want to go to Hawaii is because I want to spend time with my family. I rarely get to spend anytime with my family. The reason that is because I have to go to school and my work and stuff. Then my when i comeback home my dad has to go to work. He comes back around midnight. So basically I never get to see him. I probably see him like for 10 minutes but then I cant. At least I get to see him during holidays.

The first thing I would want to do when I get to Hawaii is go to the huge water park. I want to go there to have fun. I also want to ride all the slides in the park. I want to play around with my family and have fun with them. Me and my dad always go on big slides when we're in a water park.

Another activity I would want to do when I get there is ride a bike around the city i'm gonna be staying at. I want to get to know the city and all of its locations. I also would love to ride on the mountains so i can get a nice view and take some photos.

Something else I would do is swim in the crystal clear oceans with my family. I have never seen my feet when i'm in the ocean and i want to experience that. I also want to have fun throwing a ball around with my family.

The first things I would want to see in Hawaii is go scuba diving and get to see the beautiful sea creatures swim around the ocean. Also for reason I want to get to touch them, and I want to see my families reaction. I always wanted to sea wild sea creatures. I never get to sea them because the closest ocean to me is dirty so you cant see nothing under the water. I want to see them swimming around and see other animals in the water. Every time I see a sea creature. The only way I would see one is if I caught it with a fishing rod or its dead on the sand or In the aquarium.

I would really want to go on a helicopter and see all of Hawaii. I just want to explore and get a beautiful view of Hawaii. At least see two dolphins hop from the ocean. That would be a perfect moment. But I just want to see Hawaii. I would probably go see one of does fire performance too.

One more thing I would want to go see in Hawaii is my family having fun. I want to see them having fun because I rarely get to see them having fun. We usually don't have fun because were not always together. One of my family membesr has to work and the other has to do something else. I really wished we could spend time longer together.

I would go to Hawaii because I get to increase the relationship with my family and have fun. If I got to Hawaii i'm not be stressed out during that time.",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0
5BF7AAC78AB5,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that "" success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" I agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. Just like saying ""if you want to know everything you got to not know anything first."" , ""if you want to be rich you got to be poor first."" , ""You got to learn how to walk before you run.""

Every people that are smart, rich and well-know there are all born without any of that just like every single one of us, no one is perfect. We all have something that we are good at and something that we are bad at.

The way to successful is not hard to get there. Do what you are good at. Make sure you are enjoin what you are doing. Just like this one man that I forgot his name said ""get a job that you are enjoin doing it, a job that you have fun doing it and you will jump out of the bed in morning.""

You are who you are right now because of all the mistake you make in the pass. ""success consists of going from failure to failure."" you lean from your mistake. If you never do anything wrong that mean you never do anything at all. All the mistake you make you better because you lean from it. You can also lean form another people mistake too. It's one of the reason why most of thing in world got better.

Soccer is the sport that I like. I'm not that good at it but not that bad either. When I first start playing I don't know a lot about it so I keep playing unit I know a little bit more about it. Then I start playing with the pro player because I know that I'm gonna make a lot of mistake and all those mistake gonna help lean how to play and how to get better and it does. I make a lot of mistake I still do but I like to take a hit sometime it make me stronger. you know what they say ""what doesn't kill you make you stronger."" so I keep trying and trying hope that I can make that to be my job. Mistake dose help you it may be a big one something or a small one but all the mistake help you. I was really bad at soccer once but now I petty good at it.

All of this should explain why Churchill said that""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Mistake is a part of you it's a part of everything but it's not all way bad.

(make me pass please)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ",3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,3.0

some student take this program in summer school, because they want to finish the high school in three year, and go to the college in less time.

The program of graduate in three years is not good because student need help for the teacher, student learn more with teacher help, and they pay a better attention etc.

The program of graduate in three year is good, because you graduate in less time, and you can go in summer school for graduate the next year, but is more hard, more responsibility, and more work etc.

Should the school districts offer this programs? this programs offer many opportunity to graduate in three years, so i think that this is good for student, and they can have more opportunity to graduate in three years. ",3.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0

Everyone has a talent and a skill. I personally think that my talent is photographing, but photographing take skills as well. Taking pictures is relaxing, fun, and cool at the same time.

Photographing is I guess not easy and hard because while taking pictures you have to find the right angle the your photo and as well you can just take your picture in your own way.

How I developed photographing is by going out and looking at intense images.

when I go out, I always think about if I should take some photos of whats there like: the River

People, and maybe other Cities as well as Nature. While taking pictures, it's really relaxing because you can feel the wind breeze on your face and you can release your stress.

For me I think that its fun because you can take pictures whatever you want, I also think that taking pictures is cool because you can see how things looks like up close how it looks like on camera.

How I use it is by releasing everything that is on my mind. I also use it for improving my skills as well. For me sometimes its a little bit hard because I need to find the right angle for the photo Im taking. My photograph skills aren't that good, but I practice everyday so I could take better images.

During my free time I go out and find some photographic things like: Insects, the Moon, and other objects, and take pictures of them.

To conclude , in my opinion I think that photographing can be your talent and your skill as well because if you like looking at intense images then you can take an intense picture too, or you can take it just for fun. Besides, maybe you can try to see how your photograph skills are too.     ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5
5C764A810680,"Do you want your child home school to adopt the four-day school week and extend the schools hours?

I do not agree with schools extending the schools hours nor adopting a four-day week.

Some students have just do not like what they are doing in class or do not get the chapter, so they get others students to do it for them.

They can get a lot of homework, so if they extend the school day they are going to have more homework than usual and be tired.

Students can get home late and cannot spend time with their families, if they have a lot of homework.

Within four-day school week students can get stressed out worst than usual.

The way that parent can react for adding more hours.

First, some people act like they do not know what they are doing, just because they are lazy.

In my opinion, some students like others students to do their work and that is not fair for the other student.

Allowing to extend the schools hours is going to mess people schedule or their parents work schedule.

Some parents get out of work early and they got time to pick their child up, if we extend the schools hours that could really mess them up.

Students are so much smarter if they focus on what they want.

I believe that once you put your mind to it, you will get it.

Next, parents do not like their child to get home so tired.

Some parents like to know how was their day or how their grades look like, but if a student is tired all the time how she or he suppose to have good grades?

Sleep is one of the most important things that a human being needs.

A human cannot go long without sleep.

Parents like to see their child happy, with energy, and doing things that she or he likes

If students do not have the sleep they need to have, that is going to mess with his or her grades.

School is hard itself and I do not think adding more hours is going to be helpful.

Finally, getting home late and stressing out are one of the worst things ever.

Stress can lead you to have some type of illness in the future.

What some people do to release stress is that they get a day to themselves and go to a spa or shopping.

Other people get things done first and they would like to shopping or to do something they like such as going to the movies, play video games, and play any sport.

Students get a lot of homework in a week, imagine in a four-day week.

People should really think first what they are going to do and get it done.

Some people just like taking everything as a joke and that is not good, but that is on them.

In my opinion just do it, just get it done and get it over with.

Some people just get lazy but they still get it done.

No matter what's on your way, you can always get things done.

When getting home late from school or any activity all you want to so is rest.

Some people go to sleep knowing that they have homework or a test the very next day, if they did not study or got their homework done, they might have a zero or both things.

That is why I think it is important to study and not to adopt the four-day school week.

In conclusion, conserving energy and resources has a lot of benefits, but I do not agree with adding hours to school.

Students have it so much harder now days that I think extending the school day is going to be even worst.

Some disadvantages are people get stress easily, they will have a lot of homework, and finally they can get home late especially if they have to stay after school.

Honestly people who agree on this have their good or bad reasons, but these are my reason why we should agree to extend the schools hours nor adopting the four-day school week.

However, just do what's have to be done for you to accomplish your dream.

If they add more hours to the school or not, do not worry just focus on you.",3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5

In this life time is the most valuable thing students can lose. Although students would have a three-day weekend, they would not lose any minute of class, nevertheless they would have more time to work because they would go to school only four days per week, which would give them more time to earn more money at work, spend more time with family and friends, and do their homework and projects on those three-day weekend.

To begin, energy is the most usable thing everyone use, and if students do not start to conserve it, in the future it could be difficult to get. For example, technology in schools is advancing over the years. Teachers give homework and projects to students online where they have to use their smart phones, which need energy to get charge, so they can use them for their assignments. They also use internet, which requires energy to function. This proves that if Generic_School extend the school day two hours for a four-day school week to conserve energy and resources, teachers would have to start giving students homework in which they have to use books. Obviously, students would have to adapt to find information for their homework and projects in books, like old times, and stop using technology to find information.

Furthermore, students would like the idea of having a three-day weekend. For example, they could use that time for work, spend time with family and friends, and do homework and projects. This shows that students would not miss any day of school because they would spend the same amount of hours they usually spend at school, but only in four days; the two extra hours Generic_School would extend on the schedule for a four-day week, would sum the hours the students spend on a regular week, yet they will divide that time in four days. They also can earn more money if they work more hours on those days that they would have off. Students would also have more time to study for any test they may have, or do any homework or projects. Clearly, this will be a benefit for students and teachers. They would get an extra day off without missing anything at school.

Overall, students would enjoy their three-day weekend studying, working, or spending time with family and friends because they would have an extra day on the weekend. Students would also adapt to find information in books. In conclusion, if Generic_School extend the school day two hours for a four-day school, would be helpful to conserve energy and resources.",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0
5DD1954E47A8,"How old were you when you decided what you wanted to do for a living? Some schools are requiring students to choose their career before entering high school, witch shouldnt be done. Although it is understandable that students know witch career path they would like to take to start preparing early. Students should not be choosing their careers at a young age as they are to young and inexperienced with the world, should be more focused on enjoying their childhood and lastly should work up slowly to decide what they would like to be when they grow up.

Students before high school are to young to choose a career path, as they most likely do not have much responsibilities. For example a child with little experience on responsibility might choose a career that requires you to be very responsible. The child with little experience on responsibility will quickly be stressed and overwhelmed and will most likely under preform. An older student will have more responsibilities and will have more experience, most likely will choose a career that will be a better fit for them and require responsibilities they are comfortable handling.

Young students shouldn't be extremely focused on what career path they want to take. They should be more focused on enjoying their childhood. By engaging in extracurricular activities such as: sports, music, reading and acting. By participating hobbies they enjoy being a part of. The students will explore and experience more witch will help them as they get older in choosing what they like and what they would like to do for living by simply having fun. As we only have one childhood and we shall enjoy it while it last.

A way of introducing careers to young students without making them commit to a specific one. Is having classes in schools that teach a specific career such as: construction, engineering, agriculture and law enforcement. By providing classes like this to children they will be open to explore new things without committing to one career. Slowly introducing different careers to students by having extra classes. Is a good way for them to start thinking about their future without making them choose one specific career.

Overall students at a young age should not be choosing their careers. It its way to much stress for a child. They are way too inexperienced in responsibility. Should be focused on enjoying their childhood. Introducing different careers at a young age without making them commit is helpful way. This will slowly introduce them to different careers without making them commit to one and risk stressing them out.

If they start in high school they will have more experience about the career and might be able to get a lot more job opportunities. The more experience you have, the more you'll get payed. They will also be able to focus on their career before college and have more knowledge about it. Some people say you shouldn't commit to a career at a young age because if they dont like it they just wasted a few years preparing for a career that doesn't interest them anymore. However if they don't like it they can change it before entering college and have to pay for a career they dont even like and doesnt interest them, thats why its best to start committing to a career in high school. Also when jobs look at your resume and see you took classes in high school for that career and a lot more experience they will wan to higher you. when people see that you are committed to your career at a young age they respect you more and help you out to achieve your career faster.

5EFF1BA0FBC1,"Although the extra time would benefit students. Some people dont wanna stay after school because they are already tired from staying 7 hours at school. Because school can cause stress if you are forced to do much work.

I disagree because the school board is adding it to our day. They should add a after school program for kids who need help with homework. Because if they add it for everyone then we would get out of school late. And we would barley have time to do homework. On the other hand if they add it everyday then a lot of kids will be stressed. Because when they come back if they have homework,or projects to work on then they might stay up all night working on it and come to school the next day .And they will probably be grumpy or stressed.

My second reason is The teachers will also be tired and stressed because if we leave school first. Then that means they leave after us. Also they have to grade our papers and other stuff so adding extra time to school will not be a great idea because the teachers can turn mean from all the stress. They can sleep from being too tired and then that means we wont get to learn anything. And dont forget that the teachers have a normal life too. They have families that they want to see so if the school board adds extra time then that teachers might not see their families often because they will probably be too busy grading our work.

So i think that the school board should not add the time. Because if they do then they will mess everything up like people's sleep schedule,The time they might go somewhere. So over all i think that the time we leave school right now is good. Because people have enough time to do their work and projects,and to get enough sleep. So the time we have now is good because everything is balanced. But if they did change it then we would have to get used to changing our sleep time and doing school work.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0

Do you think that finishing the high school in three year helps a student to enter the university or work force one year earlier? As we know education is so important in our life and every one need to get good educate. Therefore, we need to study well to get good grades. It dosen't matter to finish high school in three year or four year. Therefore, students need to be active, hard working, and patient about the opportunities that school prepare for them.

Those student who are active in the class and participate in the lessons, they will graduate on time with a good grades that's why they don't need to do these following steps; work force one year, not having elective classes, and taking summer classes. Also, some students by taking serious the home works and completing the class work can rise their score and that helps them to do not fail on the test and no west one more year to study that subject again otherwise by failing it effect badly for their graduation year. I think the best way to solve this problem is to be as a good memmber of class and participate in schools lessons.

students with hard working can get good scores in the class and that scores helps them to be a better student in future. Even I am a student I can say that for sure that you will never lose something by trying hard and some times maybe the result will not pleasant but you should never give up and never lose hopes. For example; the student who never try hard for learning and they just come to class even they do not pay attention in lessons, these type of student will not pass the exmes and in the future they will face with lots of problem like taking classes during summer, not having elective classes. I know a lots of students who just had good score and pass their exmas and graduate without any rush.

Most of student need to be patient about the educational desitions because that desition could change their hole life. Finishing the high school early is not the point everyone knows that studying well and learning something in best way is important part of education. Although, high school students are teen and they have more time so they don't need to rush for graduating. Also, In my old school I knew a girl who wants to finish the high school sooner because she think that the faster you finish the faster you will be able to start the colloge but, that was not good idea so she undastand it later.

5F67A5D3DBB0,"I think students, parents, and including me wouldn't like the idea of adding a hour and half of a hour each day of the school thats why I disagree with the idea of extending the day of school because students have other things to do like pick up little brothers or sisters and take of them, help mom and dad with the house, do another type's of activities because if students are only thinking about school all the time we can stress out a lot and there's no rule that says that students can't have fun also we are in school for about 7 or 8 hours so i think thats enough.

First of all some of the students have little brothers and sisters and the parents work and they dont have the chance to pick up they kids because they get out of the work late, so the orders sibling haves to take care of they little brothers and sisters also little kids from elementary schools can't get out of the bus without someone picking them up, so the older siblings have to pick them up or else the little kids are going back to school and they get scared because they are the only one who are in the school and they are little so they don't know what's going on so that is one reason why we cant be in school more hours not even half of a hour.

Secondly students have to help they parents with the house how i said parents came from work late and they dont have time for nothing so students have to help them by cleaning the house, cook for they sibling and parents , they have to wash the dishes, wash they clothes, clean the rooms, some of the students have dogs and they have to go with them for a walk or take them to the doctor so when parents get home they can lay down and chill because they work really hard and all the students can do is helping doing the cleaning that is the second reason why we can't be at school more than we supposed to be.

Finally some students have another type of activities after school like dancing, soccer practice and soccer game's, basketball practice and basketball game's, step teams, community service, etc also that helps a lot to get your mind out of thinking about homework's, test's, classwork, so you dont stress out a lot because being honest sometime students have a lot of homework and test to do in each class and after school is the only time where you can get you'r mind out of school and also we are having fun for a little time because some parents are kind off strict and they don't let they kids to be outside after 8:30.

In conclusion we can't be in school more than 8 hours because all the students have more activities to do and have fun for a little time and we have responsibilities at home helping parents cleaning and taking care and picking up little siblings and we can stress out a lot if we spend more than 8 hours in school because that means more work to do and we would be only student and we would be tired because also we are not going to have time to chill and i know that no one is going to be happy about it because teachers have they children as well parents need the help of they kids and students need they own time so these are my reasons of why I disaree of adding a hour and half of a hour.

Learning in school with a teaher next to him was important for Generic_Name to get those grades.

Teachers believe that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it makes student's attention lower, and they do not learn as the same way.

Firstly, student would not benefit from begin able to attend classes from home because it makes student's attention lower.

For example, Generic_Name wants to get out of school next week, yet he wants to takes classes online, but his teacher told him that is not the best option for him.

This example shows that the teacher is telling Generic_Name don't take classes online, it would not benefit his attention at classes in the same way that school does.

Even though, Generic_Name thinks that is the best idea, at the same time is not because the only way to don't lose his attention at classes is to continue the school.

Thus, attend classes from home is not going to benefit a student attention.

Secondly, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they do not learn as the same way.

For example, Generic_Name is a student of a New York's school, his teacher says that when he started classes online he did not learned as the same way that he used to do at school.

This example shows that when Generic_Name did not continue classes in school he started to have problems with the topics because students can not learn in the same way that in school.

For Generic_Name was not important learn properly in home or school, but for his teacher yes becuase they knew already that it would not benefit learning in the same way.

Thus, distance learning is not the best option fro a student.

On the others hand, some people believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

It is true, it can be possible when a student do not speak the language, and his/her parents prefer that the student take classes online.

However, still proof that students would not benefit being able to attend classes from home.

For example, the teachers of Generic_Name and Generic_Name say that distance learning does not help students to improve their attention and apprenticeship.

Thus, it can benefit students the classes online in 20%, but the classes in schools benefit students in a 100%.

In conclusion, to restate the point students would not benefit attend classes from home.

The first reason is because it makes students's attention decrease.

Further, students are not going to learn in the same way that they used to do in school.

However some people believe that taking classes online from home will benefit to the students.

People would learn more things if they are more productive. I remember when my mom signed me up for a soccer team. I didn't know I was going to be joining a soccer team, or wanted to play on the soccer team;however, I did it and I learn how to kick a soccer ball, how to be a golly and I improved my speed. Another example was when I had a vocabulary test for English but I didnt know half of the vocabulary words, so I study till I learned the words.

Meeting new people to achieve a goals. I like being a indoor person, but when soccer season comes and I join a team I interact with new people and coaches to achieve my goals on how to become a better teammate or how I can improve my speed and mentality to become a great soccer player. Another example was when I talked to a new math teacher to help me on a equation I didnt understand. he helped me understand the equation, and helps me every time I need help on something in math now.

Imagine how much can be done if we are always doing something. people would be able to accomplish so many goals if we are always doing something instead of staying home and laying down and watch TV all day. when we get some free time we can work on something that would help us in the future and make us think better. Maybe when we think we dont need help, but actually do ask someone to help you to understand more instead of staying with the same mindset.

Although, some people maybe don't got that much time to accomplish things. Thats why they go inactive but still accomplish their goal on a long term time.

This is an controversial issue and school time should not be too much .This change would affect students and teachers because some students have part time jobs,students would not have enough time to do their daily activities with friends and family,teachers and students would be tired by the the end of the day and they would not do good.

Some students have part time jobs and they take some rest before going to work after school. Some students go to work right away after every school to get out early and do their homework after. By adding two hours a to the school schedule would make students who have job work till late. Even though some students need to work as much time as they can to help their families or pay something they are trying to buy. Some of this students would be also constantly tired of spending too much time at school and then going to work.

Another reason why school days should only be eight hours long and not ten is because students would not have enough time to do their daily activities. Students hang out with family and friends. Some students are part of a sport team and they have to have time to go practice. Even some students help their family to either clean or any other thing that has to be done at home. Some students have to take care of their little siblings after school because their parent have to go shopping or work. Students also need to do what they like and by doing that they would be more active.

Another reason is that teachers and students would be tired by the the end of a ten hours school day and they would not do good. Some students are already tired in the 4th hour of school. Some students do not want to do their work in the last class and some fall sleep even in a eight hours school day. Even teachers would get tired of being teaching and grading papers all day long. When it comes to a history teacher they have to talk a lot in every class and they get tired. By making every school day 10 hours long would put to much pressure to students and teachers that they would be exhausted by the end of the day that they would not be able to pay attention in their work.

School itself it hard sometimes but working and studding is even worst and those who work and study at the same time often need time time to get things done, and by spending too much time in just one thing can affect the other .Every one has personal things and activities to do and some require certain among of time. Studing and teaching requieres focus and creativity but when students and teachers get tired all that is missing.",4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0
61E85C09E36D,"Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble,or do they unfairly interfere young people's lives?

In my opinion yes curfews have to take care of them , it does matter if they are young, Also if they are in the night. This is a good intention from curfews, to protect them at the end the only beneficiaries are the teenagers.

For example if they are in the middle of the night they can get a trouble , because they going to do wherever they want when nobody is watching them, for other part if curfews say not they have to respect the rules .

Otherwise nobody are in the street playing or doing something good in the night, all people are in home resting or with their family doing other things, they have to apply the same for teenagers.

Also in the night someone can steal your properties, or doing something bad to someone or to you , why? to you because maybe you are watch what others are doing to someone, and you try to help or do something.

Some people thing that have fun in the night is good idea. but is not, for examples going to the clubs is not good in my opinion, because you don't not anybody ,or something can happen ,for example in Las Vegas almost 3 years ago someone shooting a club in the middle of the night many people die. In conclusion curfews have to take care of the teenagers this is good for them.  ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5
62243789233B,"In today's society, many people agree that having a simple goal and achieving it is better than having a huge goal and failing to achieve it, but i disagree. One of the greatest artists, Michelangelo, said that setting our aim too low and achieving it is a great danger for some of us. He stated this thought because he failed and made mistakes before he was known as a great artist. Michelangelo rather fail by doing something big than his life than doing something small and achieving it. I agree with Michelangelo because you learn from past mistakes, you learn to take risks, and having bigger goals help you improve ones self.

Michelangelo is a great artist because of his work, but he learned from his own work to keep moving forward. People can learn from past mistakes by seeing what went wrong and practice doing better at it; for example, in a show called

Masterchef, chefs must impress the judges by their skills in cooking but one chef gets eliminated every episode. When a chef gets eliminated their dreams may get crushed, but they had the courage to go on and did their best and can learn what they did wrong. Another example is taking the permit test as a teenager. The permit test is something big for teens since it is something related to their future. When I took the test I was nervous and failed by one question, but i checked the answers I got wrong and studied them a bit more and passed the next time I took it. These examples prove that you have the ability to learn from past mistakes, grow as a person, and that you might have to take risks in doing so.

Taking risks are mostly involved in big decisions that involve jobs, education,etc. I believe that taking risks are better than small decisions even if those risks don't turn out the way you wanted them too. In a show called Shark Tank, people come in to persuade investors to invest in their products, but they do not always succeed. The people who do not get investments keep moving forward and take their own risks to get a investor. If you learn to take risks, you later get use to it and you can speak more in front of people and state your opinion. Another example is having a meeting for a job. It is best to have a meeting in person than online because it is not as easy so you get challenged and the person interviewing can know you better and you can most likely get the position. Taking risks can make you a better person as a whole and those mistakes can help you improve.

Michelangelo and I agree that having a bigger goal and failing is better than having a small goal and achieving it. Having a bigger goal can increase your confidence and help you put your head in the task you want to overcome. People view their mistakes and overcome it so they can do better next time. Small goals do not involve much effort and work as bigger achievements; by choosing to accomplish a simple task, you as a person may get use to the easy way out and can get lazy over time. Setting a higher aim for yourself is better because you can improve your skills and knowledge. Bigger goals are better because of how much they help you improve.

A great artist once said it is great danger setting a small aim for yourself. Setting a bigger aim and failing is best because you learn from your mistakes, you learn to take risks, and bigger goals help improve ones self. Smaller aims are a scapegoat compared to bigger aims because of how much easier they are. It is best to challenge yourself so that you are ready for anything that comes your way. Even if you take the high route and fail, it does not mean you can try again. In conclusion, setting a bigger aim and failing is alright and better than setting a small aim due to it being more easy.",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0
6269A525D482,"I think it is a good idea because students might be tired of working at school everyday. Lets say that students want this the same school schedule that has a longer winter break, a year-round schools, and a week off in the spring and fall because people want more time to do spend time with family, do homework, projects etc...

First, We can spend time with family and friends, we can watch a movie with them, eat food together as a family, have parties and celebrate at our house. We need families to stay together as a group because if we don't then we are going to miss them too much as we go to college or get our new place to live. Nobody wants to stay alone because if they want to stay alone that's okay if you want.

Second, We can go on a vacation to the beach, the pool, Disney world etc... I love going to the pool in the summer because we don't have to stay at our house all day and all night. There is so much to do outside then just staying inside and doing nothing. We must stay with our family because they love you so much and they want to spend time with you too.

Finally, We can relax from work and studying we are tired of working so hard that we need a break. We are studying so hard for school, we did lots of tests and quizzes that we are tired from. We all enjoy summer vacation because we can spend time with our family and friends, we can invite our friends to eat , go to mall, watch a movie etc...

In conclusion, We must spend time with family and friends to go anywhere in the world for a vacation. We can enjoy each other by going to a amusement park or a museum to play and take pictures to save it on our phone for memories. We need to be together as a family, work as a team, having fun on a vacation.

62B3C9C3398E,"Do we have to live other people experiences?

If we want to live our own life you should start by taking a break. Think how people would like to live their lifes and then, use this as an example but do not use it for your own. We all know that life isn't easy as we want but that's life, we cannot change it. If you put your life in hands of an expert you will have the opportunity to succed but it will feel strange and you will regret later. Why? if you ask why, and this is because everything you have done it's thanks to someone else not to you, you are not living your own life, youar not having fun, no mistakes, no experiences, no control of your own life. There's always going to be a person telling you what to do and if you don't follow his/her directions something could go wrong. That's why you should live your life as you want to live it without anybody help. At first, you can have a teacher during a period of time but it doesn't mean that you will have to go and ask for help everytime you have a problem. Make your own decisions mean that you will do mistakes but you will learn even more from this and it will help you to do thigs better and it also will help you like a human. When I said human I mean that you will have your own thoughts about something and your own way to live your life and no like a robot that just follow direction and have no sense of humor.

People will never discover their great mental power because until I know they just develop the 70.3% of their mental capacity and it makes them feel useless sometimes. I don't really like to talk about other people life but one example could be Homeless people. Everyone thinks and look at the as a piece on somethings useless but if you really meet them and talk to them you will realize that they are smart and all they do and what they have in their brains is even better than what we have. The way they think and the way they look at other people make them specials and unique. Now, what can experts do to change their life or take the control of what they want to do?. As we all know, they cannot do anything and no matter what the situation could be the answer will be the same. Their decisions and their style of life before the actual I think were made by someone else and after a while they were not able to pay for what they had. Experts help you to get things but do you really think they will help you when you are really on trouble? or will they help you with things you have to pay? the answer to this is NO. In my opinion they help you because they want something from you or they will try to get something from you after you learn it. Two years ago I met an old man from Washington DC, his name was Generic_Name. His parents are from Generic_City and Generic_City. Before homeless he was a mechanic but one day while he was fixing a car he met a person who told him that he could help him to have his own workshop and he accepted. Everything was good for the first years but after some years the person left the country and Generic_Name didn't have the capacity to manage the whole store. Bussiness came down, deppression started to make him use drugs, and after a while he lost everything he had and the expert (person who help him) wasn't there to help him when he really needed him.

If you think you have the capacity to succed on your own, you have to do it and don't let anyone ruin what you have planned for your own future. It doesn't matter if he is a proffesional, you just need to learn what you need but never let them maneuver your life. People will always try to control your life but you are the one who is going to decide if you want to live the life they want you to live or the one you want to live. I am not saying that you have to ignore the advices they give you but don't follow their directions.

Nothing is difficult if you really try it and nothing can be impossible if you really want to do it. Do not live like a robot, don't let anyone take adventage of your incapacity to succed just because you do not know anything. Ask questions, ask for advices and opinions but don't do want they want to do with your life. I know life isn't easy to live but remember that we just have one and after death we cannot do anything about it. Life is going to beat you up, experiences will make you stronger every single day, decisions will make you be independent, and at the end you will see that everything you did was good and you have what you wanted without anybody help. My friend, if you let people maneuver your life, then you will cry and you will not have the future you wanted. Everything will be destroyed and disgrace will follow you anywhere.

Don't follow experts, be one of them and do your own life, have a family, have a car, an partment or whatever you want to have without asking anyone. Help is given by God when you born. He gave you two arms, two legs, two eyes and a body. A person help you to walk and talk and one time you learn this you become an indepentent person. Do everything by yourself and don't let people make you feel useless because God make them the same as you and as everyone else but they have not develop their mental capacity the waht make them special. If you do everything by yourself people will try to destroy you but be strong and try even more until get what you want. Never try to kill yourself if you don't know what to do it is better if you believe in God and in his help because he is the only one who can help you without taking anything away from you.

Never give up and follow your dreams, live your life as you want to live it but remember that no one can control what you can do if you don't want to. Life depends of you and what you do with it. No matter what happen you have to do what makes you happy always just trusting God. Remember that just God and family are our friends. Anyone else is just people we know. Fight for what you really want no matter what comes next.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
63314DE11287,"The main piece to improve your skills is during the process of keep learning. Most of the people got to the point where they become successful, thinking that they have the sufficient knowledge to stay where they are and not move forward. The most common mistake that someone can make is believe that they have learn enough to the point where is nothing else to learn. I strongly agree with the words that Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, people that have got the title of professional and keep being successful in their daily are the ones that are still adding productive information to their life and career. The actual key that makes people become professionals everyday and give them the recognition of master is through the process of keep learning new things.

Convince yourself that yo are not good enough ""Yet"" this to motivate you to believe that you need to learn more. Examples that we can see everyday, teen mothers when a young girl or even in some cases girls that are still considering a kid have to been each to be a mother. Teen mothers learn through the pregnancy to; take care of the baby, change diapers, give appropriate food and how give them bath. The process of being a mother for the first time, does not end when you give birth to the baby. There is not a book where it details you how to take care of your child, even if there is one it would probably not be as helpful as you learning each day.

If there were a class of ""How to be a mother for the first time if you are a teen"" it would not cover all the expectations that you baby requires because you will be the only one that knows your baby, its behavior and what its needs are. Even adult mothers have said that they keep learning how to be mother everyday.

Do not push back yourself because of the fact that you seen to be far away from your objective. If you have been studying for years, since first grade and still have to go to an University, it could make you think if it would be necessary those extra years. The answer is yes, even if you have been in school for about 10 years and still have to go to college to get you the information that you need to be able to get a decent job, yes it is necessary. The years where you have been taking classes that does not look that t would help you in the future in any way. They do have a purpose, and it is to inform you and help you to develop skills that have not been discover, whether you like math, history, science or languages. Any subject that you have learn is to help you find what you really like and how you can used for the future. That is why there are those extra years for college, to start to focus on your objective and teach you what you actually need to become successful. After you have got the extra years, does not mean your learning have also stop, when you get to practice for the career you have selected you keep developing your skills and growing as a person, and this because of the motivation of keep going beyond of what you already manage.

Going beyond your expectations as a person would bring you benefit to your life. If you get a job based on your skills, experiences or knowledge it would also require the same process of keep learning. If you got the job where you always wanted and they approved you to work there because you qualify and you have study the career for years does not specific mean you know everything and you would directly get to the work and lead yourself to become another worker. Like always and how the Author Ralph Emerson emphasizes you would have to keep trying new material. You have experienced the process to gather the sufficient information to get this job, but now you are being told to go beyond and now you need to learn the system of the factory, office, building, hospital or any apartment you have being positioned. In this case does not mandatory need to keep educating yourself, but to improve in your work and become an efficient person you need to keep learning new skill that would apply to your job. Like is being remarked again the importance of keep learning to do new things so you can grow.

The importance of always going forward and learn to manage new things will make you grow as a person in your life and improve the labor work. If you do not try nothing new and do not applied on your daily, do no expect to become successful as a person. You are the only one that knows how to lead yourself and what weakness and strengths you have, as a captain of your life you know where your boat should go, the wind could make you take different directions which is why you have to recognize where exactly your destination is. The fact the it seems that you have got far enough where you might feel afraid to go beyond, which could ruin what you already have does not mean it will. People argue that they are scared to keep going forward and decide to just stay stand where they are because is been far enough. You should not let yourself be the obstacle to keep learning new things to do. If you feel like that was enough and you got to were you stay, it is because you can go more fatter with the experience that you have. Do not stay in one point and make sure to keep walking and doing new stuff to help you grow, do something new everyday and prove yourself that you have become a successful person every time you go a step ahead. Keep growing to encourage yourself and others to keep doing something new and always going in different direction without stopping.",2.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0

Some school offer programs that allow students to graduate in three years. Students should graduate in three years because, they have more time planing what they want to do, they have more time to work and save money for college and they have more time to spend time with their family. To have ideas who they can do during that year.

Students should graduate from High school in three years because, some students don't know what career they want or they don't know if work or continue studying. In that year they can think and choose what they want. One of my friends graduated the last year of school and she stay at home because she doesn't know what career choose, so she just stay at home because she doesn't know what to study and can't find a job yet.

Some students after four years in High School, they take one year more to think and relax at home. That is why i think is a good idea just three years of High School. They can take that year to work and save money for college, if they want to. They can just start work to adapt to their new life or new thing that are going to learn. In a fact, student can graduate in three years of High School because is better for them. I think is better because it help those student that are more than eighteen to graduate not too old.

Some people think that students should not graduate from High school in three years because, they have less time, but they are wrong because, students can take the most important classes or they can take classes in the evenings. Some students take courses during the summers. Some students want to graduate early because have some goals that they want to complete. In the future there can be online classes for those who need extra classes.

In conclusion, graduate from High school in three years is a good idea because, students can start college or the work force one year early. Students have more time to search a good college and to prepare their thing. This is good for parents too because, they can go to the college that their son or daughter wants to go.

First of all, most people respect and value their parents. For example, when I consider getting another job,I like to discuss my options with my parents.

In my opinion cell phone use in a classroom is not a bad thing depending weather they take advantage on getting work done or goof around the majority of the students in school take advantage of their phones about Seventy Five percent of students like to use their phones for social media and music. When teachers are in classes during instructional time about half the class is paying attention, the other half of the class is on their phones texting friends or updating social media and then don't know what the lesson is about when they get called on to answer questions on the board.

Phones are usually a distraction to teachers and also to the person using the phone. Phones can also be a positive thing when doing paper work or projects when listening to music it can help concentrate more without getting distracted from others peers. When listening to music when you're working it gives off a positive affect on your brain, it gets your mind going with different types of ideas and keeps you from falling asleep. Cell phones bring hundreds of resources that would be able to help you get answers or help you understand certain questions , meaning of words , and how to pronounce different type of sentences from other languages.

Most teachers don't allow phones or headphones in a classroom because they assume everyone's going to start texting and be on social media, cell phones are important to have close just in case of an emergency at home. In case if you wanna check up on your siblings, mom, or dad even if you can notify the school about contacting your parents or your parents contacting the school it'll be easier for them to call you.

Some schools usually provide tablets for students to use so they wouldn't have to worry about loosing an assignment or turning it in late, but the majority of the time you need internet to be able to open up assignmets to turn in school students usually have tablet problems and turn it in so it could get fixed. Cell phones is a big help it can usually download applications that you neeed to do work without being behind in certain subjects so there shouldn't be an excuses on why assignments are late, or missing and that's why cell phones are a positive affect for educational purposes as long as teachers are consistant on supervising students cell phone use.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0
6792C2E73B6A,"Some people agree with the statement ''success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm'' because the failure help to learn how other's to be prepared and better understanding. But many people disagree with Churchill's for the reason what they don't believe in the failure because if they fail something they do better the next time. Since, no one is perfect everybody have something bad and something good this don't make a different the other's.

Although many people concern the failure how something the need due for doing a better person in the life but that does the means they can't due. Some people thinking what the failure is important for they life because they learning a new things and they put all of they for doing good person. Clarity, this people due everything for not failure something.

Additionally, many people don't believe in the faillure they say is somenthing happed in the life for doing a better person. If they fail a class or don't pass the class they keep trying and never give up. Surely, with failers they learn from the expirence they will not loss the enthusiasm.

Ask you can see failure is not always a good way to major sucess. One need to success failure is put a attention and due a better person and trying hard. If this people trying the things wiil be better in they were doing. Although all many people are success with failure.

Truely, failure is part of life and we need to understand our failers so the we can successed. By understanding our failers learn how doing better and not worry about the failers. Since they are worry about the failers one can have more enthusiasm to success.        ",2.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5
68004683BC3C,"I Disagree the school board is adding one and half hours each day of school. We have regular school days seven hours a day. Also some people stay afterschool that palce two more hours of school. That is nine hours of school. I usally stay afterschool for peer helpers every wenesdays. That helps me to get my communite servers up I already have six hours, I just need nine more hours that is it. But either way I love helping special kid's and also I will love to finish this year helping PROPER_NAME, even though I'm about to finish my community severs hours I will still help the kids.

Anyways this about me disagreeing with school borad. What I'm really trying to say we wake up at six o'clock or five o'clock and we come to school and we do our work. Some of as have good grades and some of as are trying our best. We recpect our teachers as much as we could, we do our work and we some how understand what the teacher gives us. Also we try our best as we could.

Another example that you can't add more hours to our school is that some students have sports afterschool not in school out of school. Even though there is sports in my school they already sign up for other sports. Some students wants to just go home and be in her/she home and just study quietly instead of afterschool, afterschool is every loudly its not for everybody. All of us have good examples and they will tell why its a bad idea and they will disagree with you. But I know where you guys are coming from you want us to have more education.

I really hope you don't add more hours because seven hours is enough for us to learn. We got other things to do afterschool. If you add more hours, students will be picked up every last period and not even be there when the teacher is teaching. Also we will not have afterschool activity because students can't stay afterschool past six o'clock. Also if you add more hours parents will take out their childern and they will put them in a different school. That what I think about you adding more hours to school. I hope you think about it and think about if your idea we are actally taking benfits.

Why I disagree with school board is wrong that you guys are adding more hours of school. For example, like I said I stay afterschool on wendesday's and seven hours of school place the two more hours for afterschool. It gives me headace and our late bus is the last one to go, so basically I go home five o'clock and sometime when the late bus comes early I go home like 4:48pm. When I go home I eat and take a shower I watch for a little bit I say I'm take a nap it doesn't end up a nap it ends up I wake up at six o'clock. Also sometimes when I don't stay afterschool, I take nap at home I wake up at eleven o'clock, I go to sleep at three o'clock. This why I want don't you guys to add more hours because it will effect our sleeps.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
6805FE96E548,"Students having the option to have distance learning would only be great for students who are responsible and cable of keeping up with their assignments. Distance learning is beneficial to students because they won't have to worry about getting up early to go to school and also, don't have to worry about that amount of time they have in class to finish an assignment. Taking online classes gives the student more freedom to expand their thinking while having their own space at home.

A way that distance learning benefits students is not having to wake up at 6 or 7 am in the morning to go to school. Some kids don't show their full attention in school because they're not a morning person. Having to wake up in the morning and sit in a classroom for 2 hours is uncomfortable. For example, I'm not the type of student that can sit in a classroom for 2 hours or more and listen to a teacher talk. I would, prefer to move around and also eat while i'm doing my work that makes me feel more focus. But, in high school your not allowed to randomly get up and walk around it would make the teacher feel unsafe or the students. Waking up at 9 to 10 is a good time to start your online classes because you had enough time to wake up shower , eat and that most important part is that you dont have worry about what clothes your going to wear to school.

Another reason that distance learning is beneficial to students is because as high school students is not really easy to keep up with a teacher. when they're teaching a lesson with 28 more students in the classroom that probably already understood the assignments. There are some teachers are just not the type to go back and repeat their self. For example, When a student miss class it feels like you missed a whole quarter. The teacher is not going to explain the whole lesson to 1 student she would simply say check online for the assignment. This is an example of why students would prefer to take online classes because theres no way a student can be absent. Student can walk around anywhere with their computer or phone and simply pull up the school work and start doing it on their free time.

Some students would say its better to come to school, meet people and have the high school experiences. Although it sounds fun. Theres still students that would prefer being home and getting their work down at home then being in school dealing with drama or extra assignments. Theres students who would rather focus on online classes and finish them and also have a part time job on the side to help them pay for their colleges.

In conclusion, distance learning is an advantage to students who are proactive and for students who learn better on their own. Having to do your school work online and especially at home makes it feel more comfortable. Its also helping students get ready for the real world when they have to take home assignments from work and make sure to stay focus.     ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

Online school could not only help scholars to graduate on time, but also help a portion of scholars that are looking to get a job for future education, or helping their households. Online school may also be a helpful option for scholars with disabilities, or illness that might stop them to attend school.

Although online school might be a good tool for some scholars it can also cause negative outcomes such as students not doing their assign work, or not passing the class due to less time with students. Other issues that must be faced ,are some students not having computers, or not having access to the internet to do their assigned work. Overall online school is a great tool for students that may struggle to attend school. Once its issues are met and something has being done online school may not be only a great tool for some scholars but also an opportunity to finish school without any issues.

In conclusion online school might have many issues but once its issues have being solved and students get help with access to computers, or internet it could make a big impact on young scholars. Online school may also help economy by allowing students to have enough free time to get a job to help in their households, and their future.

Having a good attitude can helps people to get a job. For example, if there is two guys on a job interview and one of them show a positive attitude while are asking him questions but, the other person is answer all the question with a bad attitude, the person with a positive attitude will get the job because, a good attitude show who you really are.

Showing a positive attitude can really show where you came from and how your parents educate you. Other wise, if a person show a bad attitude and he is insulting all the people and his way that demonstrate that his parents didn't gave him a nice education. Because, the attitude came from how your family had teach you to respect the people.

A nicely attitude can even help in the education. In other way attitude is the most important key in education because, nobody will teach someone with a bad education. It is important to demostrate a positive attitude when a teacher is explaining something because, that way you desmostrete the techer how much effort you are putting in the education and that you really want to success in your life.

-Some students get out of the schools becauses they wants to help their family , and pass more time with them; take caring of they youngues bothers, sister, or work to get many into their house.

6A977849DE08,"More is better than one. Asking more than one person will never harm you in any way. What it will do though is make you mare confident about what advice you are getting.

So, whenever you ask for advice, always ask more than one person.

You should ask more than one person for advice because you might find something that help you with another problem. You might not find what you are looking for but it can help you in the future. Whenever I ask for advice I always have one person that tell me something that's completely different but it always help me out later or with another problem. For example, once I asked my friend if he could give me advice on what to study for the math test. He couldn't give me advice for the math test but he ended up giving me advice for the science test.

You always want to make sure you are getting the right advice and collaboration is a big key to finding if the advice, opinion or fact is correct. If more than one opinion collaborates or says the same thing it's more likely to be true than the one that doesn't. This method can also help you with a project. For example, when you're working on a project you want to go to more than one website to check if they have the same information. That way you know for sure you are getting the right information. If you ask multiple people for their opinion on something and five of them same give you the same thing but one person says something totally different. You know he is wrong.

Collaboration is a good way to check if the information is correct but what if you don't understand the information or don't have enough to back it up. Asking more than one person for the same thing can help you build on the same thought and make it better. Maybe you just don't understand what they are talking about but somebody else might restate the same sentence and that might help you understand it better. I know this because Rome and Islam used the same technique and that's what helped survive for so long. For example, when Rome was going to war with Carthage they didn't have a navy but they found boat from Carthage was up on shore. They took the boat apart and made hundreds of copies of it but they improved it by adding a plank so they can walk over to another boat and attack them.

If you are working on a project, a essay or just asking for advice always ask more than one person to make sure it's correct and the best. ",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0

Although some people disagree about Emerson's statement, actually I agree because society is always trying to make people change their point of view, their culture, their belivers. First never give up, Second always love and be proud of yourself and Third don't forgot your roots.

Here are some reasons why I agree with Emerson's statement. First, the world is trying to make change but you have to never have to give up. Becuase it's important to continue being yourself, not matter if some people are not going to like it, the only one who have to feel comfortable with yourself it's you. Second, always love and be proud of yourself. It's important to be proud of who you are because eventhough you make mistakes sometimes that doesn't have to make change who you are. You just have to learn from your mistakes, I know it is difficult but no one says that would be easy ,but you can do it. Love yourself because every of your features, your character and your personality is what identify you, is make you unique, different from anyone else in the world that wants you to fit on it. Third, don't forgot your roots. If you are from another country you are forced to change yourself, trying to pretend that you are someting else, but you must have to stop it. Because in a world that is constantly trying to make you be something else your biggest accomplisment is to show that you are better than what they expected you to be.

Finally what are you waiting for!.

If I would have chosen this offer, I would have 3 reason why I agree that offer. Student should always think first if a school offers you something.

My first reason is, student can take their time in the morning to wake up and take a shower. For example, if a student wakes up late to school, that student wouldn't have time to do stuff he/she planned in the morning. But online school, that student can wake up late and take their time what he/she planned in the morning. My second reason is that its less cheaper. In online school, students only need: a computer, notebook, and something to write with. Students also receive free food from their home. But in regular school, some student pay money to get food, and the supplies for each class can be expensive. My last reason is student sometime finish their online school early, and have the rest of the day to play games, or hang out with friends.

In conclusion, student should always pick the right decision, when it comes to a offer in school. I think online school is good for students. Why, because if a student that is having family problems, and missing school every day.

Parents, siblings, friends and idols have the power of being able of influence on others by giving advises based on their own life experiences. Old people advises are the most effective because of their great wisdom and erudition. Generic_Name's grandfather was a well-known writer and gave many advises to Generic_Name about how to write good essays. after all that, Generic_Name has been awarded with different prices and many scholarships that required essays.

Every culture have different societal rules, but each rule can influence and shape anyone as a person. All personalities are different but most personalities are modified by cultural rules. When Generic_Name went to Dubai, she decided to wear a hijab although she was not Muslim because if she did not wear it, people would look at her with contempt, this shows how social. stereotypes can affect anyone.

The most effective ways to influence others are: peer pressure, advises and social stereotypes. If all humans were influenced by good people with good intentions, life would be easier, and there would never be a lack of good poeple trying to influence other on the way of success and saintliness.",3.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,3.5

You should think about working hard and being the best

No people should not make there own decisions because sometime people need more opinions with thing they do. Like if they want to watch a move they can ask others on what to watch and they can help you out. Some people will say it's your life do what you want, make your own decisions but it is not that easy. I feel like sometime it's better to get guidance from other people, like my parents or older siblings because they are older and have been through some of the thing I have gone through. Sometimes things get hard in life and you are going to need help, we all as people need someone in life to help guide us through thing that may be bad. If you don't know what you want to be in life then you can think about things you like or get help from someone that you know that had that career. There is always going to be someone to go to for help even though people will say it's better to work by your self because you will not make any mistakes but we all make mistakes.

6E842F21D6E4,"There are people in every part of the world that, they can not be retract based on what they say, or on what they have done as a result of their acts giving in their first impressions. The first impressions can give to a people in a idea, feeling, or an opinion. A people can hurt someone else feeling based on their opinion, because they do not think what adequate words they going to say. And when they want to fix the problem may be too late. The first impressions are almost impossible to change, because people can hurt someone else feelings and cause people change.

First impressions can hurt people's feelings in fact, I did to my sister yesterday. My sister and I were talking about her wedding yesterday, her wedding is next year in April, and we are preparing for her best day ever. We have to look for her dress and all the things that she is going to use for that day. She is like my second mother, and I want to make sure she looks beautiful on that day. While we were talking and looking for dresses in the internet, she saw a wedding dress, and my first impression was like, no that dress is ugly, and I told her she was going to look like a real skull in dress, because she is skinny. But I never thought I was going to hurt her feelings in my first impression, the dress was ugly, even though she liked but I wanted for her the pretties dress for her wedding. I felt badly for her, because I did not think my words before I said to her. I told her sorry, but she was little upset about me for the words I said to her, as I always say, what people say is what they receive. Lately my sister did not talk to me, I was sad and I talk to her, I apologized for the words I said. She told me it was okay, that I did not meant to said it. My sister and I, we are happy now. In the following manner, my friend Generic_Name invited me on her birthday and Her friend told me that I was looking ugly, and that I was a ugly and slow girl, in front of her other friends, her impressions about me hurt my feelings. She retract based on what she said, but it was too late, I left from Generic_Name party I went home, and I was little sad, the girl went to my home she wanted to talk to me, she apologized and I told her she hurt my feeling but I was fine, and gave her some advises and she left with this, first impressions are almost impossible to change because hurt someone else feelings.

Additionally, first impressions can cause people change, as an example of my best friend I gave her an opinion about her boyfriend. I told her that he does not love her, because I saw him kissing with a girl in the school. She told me I was crazy, I was just jealous because she had the most handsome boyfriend in the whole world. Matter of fact he was cute, but he wanted just play with the girls. My best friend change with me a lot, she did not want to talk to me no more. About the things that I told her. Lately I realized that he had a twin brother I made a mistake, that my first impressions to him was a fatal mistake. After all, I wanted to apologize with my best friend, but she was mad with me. It was impossible to talk with her. I realize that my first impressions about the idea of his boyfriend had change my friendship with her. Today I just talk rarely with her, it was almost impossible to change my idea, but I did, but my friendship is changed. First impressions cause people change.

Some people may say, the first impressions is possible to change immediately, because is not a big deal. They may say that the other people, does not care about their first impressions from them. But this is not case, people always get hurt when they receive a bad impressions to them, they make them to change even with themselves. First impressions are almost impossible to change, even if the problem is big.

Thus, the first impressions is almost impossible to change, because what people say is not easy to retract. Is not easy to correct the mistakes, is not easy to correct the words that people do not meant say them. If people say their impressions without thinking them, and then apologized that is fine, but sometime is almost impossible to correct the first impressions, because people hurt someone else feeling. Also, there are sensitive people and they may not forgive people. People may change based on someone else idea, feeling, and opinion.

6FDAD6124B9E,"Ever since you were little, have you ever noticed that your really good at something as you grew over time? Everyone has a talent or a skill that are common or very unique. I have gained a talent over years and I just realized not to long ago. My number one talent I have it dancing hip-hop because I took classes for 9 years and I got inspired by the artist I mostly love.

My number one talent is hip-hop. Hip-hop's really been a big part of my dancing life over years. I took classes at a place and just remembered having so much fun and learning new dance moves. Since I started taking classes of hip-hop and learning new things, I thought that this might be the number one thing I might actually be good at. I have once broken my ankle by learning a new dance move. The bone was out of place and the bone was a bit cracked. At that moment I was just thinking about the pain but once I got home and was able to rest, I just had the fear of not being able to dance and it made my heart shatter into 7. After a 8 or 9 weeks I felt better and was able to dance again. I had to be careful and not hurt myself again. when I first got there I was not a good dancer like most of them. Once I was there for almost a year I learned a lot because they would tell me little secrets of their's. I got better ever since and now I teach my closest friend how to dance. I took dance class for 9 years and it helped me a lot with my dancing skills.

I got inspired by the artist I love the most. Ever since 2012 December 22 I found a group of boys that were new. I watched their video's and I was in love with them. They debuted in 2013 June 13 with their first song called ""No More Dream"". They were called BTS. There are a seven member group, there stage names are RM, Jin, Suga, J-hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. They are a band from South Korea. Their fan's are called ARMY. As years passed by and they became the biggest boy band in the whole universe and galaxy! I was inspired by their music but also their dancing, which got me more into dancing. I learned all their dance moves from their music video's to their stage performances. They also inspired me to dance more because ever since I was little I liked dancing and over the years I got better, they kept telling me to keep going which I did and that's when I made up my mind. I was now planning to become a back up dancer for them when they went on tour. I was planning to already become a dancer so I practiced more. When I became 13 I was able to dance and more like some one was controlling me with strings, like I was a puppet.

Now that I am 14 I decided to teach others who wanted to learn how to dance. It's been 9 years of dancing so why not. After learning to dance hip-hop I felt like an animal that's been let back in the wild. Dancing is a big part of life if you love it and enjoy it. BTS has taught people many things but the one line they said about dancing is ""There are 2 deaths in life. The first one is when you lose the passion of music and dance and the second one is death. The first death though is more painful."" Those are not the exact but very close to the meaning. My number one talent is dancing hip-hop because I took classes for 9 years and I got inspired but the artiest I love the most. What's the one talent that you have, do you actually want to become better or move on.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5
6FEF6D46714D,"Has it ever crossed your mind that people today are struggling to make their own decisions, and wanted feedback from other people and just maybe wanted to change their mind. Well people today are just going what their own decisions they make, I am the type of person to ask for some feedback or ask other people about, is this a good choice im making, can I do something better then what I did yesterday. I believe that people should take other peoples' guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matter due to people wanting help in the real world, and also tell them about the past so they do not mess up on there life choices.

What is more important the choices you make or the outcome of it? Teenagers about my age need to make better choices, but why you may ask. Today Teenagers are just ruining their own life in school. Teens need to focus on what is right for them making better decisions, like not to drink, help mom out in the kitchen, and do something productive. Teens decisions now can affect the decisions they will make sometimes in the future. For example I changed one of my friends decisions to not drink because that will cause him in the long run, like ever makes it big and someone sends that picture to social media his life can be ruin. Therefore I think teens or people should also ask other people that have already or still is living for a better decisions in important matters.

Why should I go to someone else for a better decisions for some dumb reason they are going to give me, wrong. If you ask someone, you should actually listen to see what they have to say and understand the concept. It is better to have someone else opinion on how to change my decisions. Well they have lived longer than you have, they have more experience,and more life choice taking. All im trying to say is that in my opinion is that you should always take someone else decision because maybe it will help other people in the long run. Maybe it will lead them to build something amazing, start their brand company. Just something between those lines. Someone else decisions can actually change the person you are right now. I've had so many people bring me down on how I'am going to never make it the Army branch. I'm just gonna be a lawn mower, a person who just cuts grass for living. Even though they making money that not my passion. My recruiter told me to never let someone enter your head with bad thought and let them struggle you with these bad thoughts. One of his saying was ""yesterday was the past,today is the present,and tomorrow is a mystery"".

In conclusion People should take other peoples guidance from experts and authorities about matters due to people needing a little more help, telling them stories about the past so they dont go through that rough past and make the same mistakes. I agree that some people may not what to interact with other people or even care about what they want to say. I agree but if you just hear them out they might just convince you to change your mind. All I'am just trying to say if you do not like the hits or opinion they are trying to give you just back off and find someone new or just go with the flow and follow what your heart attends you to do.

70041E13A0CC,"Distance learning was popular, and had so many students and parents chose instead of attend in class. It is convenient and highly support for students in many different way. In the other side, it has a limited things become disadvantage for students who taking classes at home such as communication to solve the problems, competition each other and experiences inspiration from teachers. Those are the most important things school offer to students. It is made valuable that distance learning never could gives to students.

The first and the obvious things that students would not benefit from distance learning is communication. Communication is the the person gives and exchanges information to the others, either verbal or non-verbal. For example, some students have watched video, and they still misunderstand and how would they figure out what they have learn, different teachers is different way to teach. Instead of video conferencing, school offers to students time to see teacher, professor to discuss their problems and find out what they were struggling with. That is why communication so important that distance learning can not offer to students.

The second advantage to being in class instead at home is competition. Competition is person versus or competitive with another person or group, each of which is trying to do better than all of the others. The best example is the one student in class got an highest score test, the others will do whatever it takes to get higher that score was. School always creating the competitive for students to participate, and that way makes students get more interesting at work help them to prepare for examination. That is the reason why competition is necessarily and advantage that distance learning would not have to offer students at home.

The last thing students could not get from online classes or video conferencing is the experiences and inspiration from teachers, professors. The experiences is the knowledge or skill gather from the pass; the inspiration is person with confidence and desire to do something that makes the the other people follow. During the class, not just the lesson from the math or English or Science, students would receive a life lesson from their teacher. Teachers could share the experience from their pass and motivation student who has the same the path, then students would not struggle with the same mistake they did. That was the most valuation that students can not get anywhere except in class.

Eventually, classes give students a lot of thing that they would not benefit from being at home. Attend to class offer students communication to easier solve their problems, created competition place for students and experiences inspiration from the teachers for students have a better way to learn. Those things that online learning students would never received. class is not just a lesson, it is also the small society that students should have before the real life. That was the reason why attend classes better than onine learning at home. ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
7065B172D758,"When you have a problem do you think to yourself, how can I do my best to fix this problem? American jazz legend Duke Ellington said,""A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" In my opinion, I agree with Duke Ellington's quote. One reason, is if you don't try to do your best in a situation you could end up regretting your decision. Another reason, is if you try do your best in a situation you could end up learning something new. Lastly, if you don't put any effort try to resolve a problem you could end up back in that hole.

I agree with this quote because if you don't try to do your best in a situation you could end up regretting your decision. One reason, is the amount effort you put in to a problem could affect your future. Also, a chance to do your best to fix a problem could be a one time opportunity. One example, of this is about my cousin he could have been playing professional soccer but he didn't try his best on the tryout which made him not make the team. Lastly, if you don't do your best in a situation it could affect your life.

I also agree with this quote because if you try your best in a situation you could end up learning something new. First, if you try your best in a situation you can learn on what to improve on. One example, is about my brother he did his best on a test and got a 82 percent now he knows he has to improve in that subject. Another example, is when one of my friend's brother did his best in a race and lost which made him train more and harder to improve his speed. Overall, If you don't do your best you will not learn and improve from a situation.

Another reason, I agree with this statement is because if you don't try your best in a situation then you will end up back in the same hole. First, if you don't try to solve a problem then it will come back in to your life and you will have to deal with it again. First example, is about my younger brother who didn't try on a test and got a bad grade which made him retake the test. Also, if you try to solve a problem then you will learn from your mistakes and wouldn't commit the same mistake twice. Finally, it is important to do your best in a situation because it would make you improve yourself from your mistakes.

In conclusion, I agree with this quote because you should always try to do your best in a problem. First, you wouldn't regret at least trying to solve a problem. Then, you could learn ways to improve on, to help you solve the problem. Also, if you try your best in a problem then, when you have the same problem you will know how to solve it. Finally, if there is a problem it's also chance for you to show others what you can do.      ",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,5.0
70D93EF3CE5F,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""To be yourself in the world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" Currently your accomplishments, acts, and attitude speak of you and how great you are, around the world many of the people think do something else is a act of a humble person for example: on your career, your area of work, in the school you do something it's not your responsibility,the people gesture the big heart has and how important it is show to the world you trying make something else to dial the different. I am agrees because when being yourself the people see something special on you and try to be a person you like to learn new things maybe in the first try thats no gonna be perfect but you never give up to be different around a lot of person. three reasons for being yourself is important: first other persons gonna be like you, second you gonna be inspiration for everyone, third your accomplishments can change the mentality of many people around you.

First being yourself is important because other person they gonna be like you, in a situation like you always do the extra mile, is when you help other no matter it's no your job example: in the school you explain to your friend how resolve any equation of math but is not your job in the class, because you are only a student and it is the teacher responsibility of the teacher explain to your friend, and the accomplishment many person they gonna be like you

Second being yourself is important because you gonna be inspiration for everyone, in many area like in your house, neighborhood, school, college, including church. For example: if you neighbor look it you clean you yard or your house or helping others neighbors, like cut the grass and help each other you can be motivation for other person, thats how complete your accomplishment of be inspiration for other person.

Last being yourself is important because your accomplishment can change the mentality of others, than the people see it your progressive on your life doing thing the other people ask them self, how they did it?, you can leave a massage and tell them how you did it , and if you did it they can do it too. For example: in the family always we can see different type of family, one they have job but with lower salary, and one with their own company, if we are the type of person like to help your own family you gonna transmit that like good vibes, hope, etc.

In conclusion, like the author said is constantly we like a humans trying to do extra things to have a great result and accomplishment in the life, and more then 50 percent of the world do that because the majory of the person see the benefits of help to others, and the most important the world see a positive side of this massege that the author said always do something else and our greatest accomplishment can be example for another person around of us because more than example we can be inspiration for many people in the world.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
7138786DA45C,"Is it a good idea to finish high school in three years than four years?

Four years is to long to graduate from high school. In four years you do a lot of things you can participate in many activities. For example: sports, clubs and help the teachers. High school is an important and necessary step to get to the successful, is a requirement in life because of the education and the things that you should learn. The school will help you in life to know how to act and guide you in what is better and you get a better life with school.

School should be just 3 years instead of four. In four years the student learn more, but I don't think is necessary to be in the school all that time. Three years of high school is a challenge. The student have to be after school and take classes during summer is a lot of stress and a lot of things to do, but is not impossible. If the student want to success in life it doesn't matter how much time it will take the only thing that is important is to accomplish the goals.

I am agree with the idea to finish high school in 3 years, I think that 3 years are enough for the student to learn all the stuff that needs. high school is hard but not impossible to finish, and is a good idea to push the students to graduate before, there are better opportunities and the only thing that I think when someone is telling me that I have to be more time in the school is ""I'll be old when I'll finish the school"" and that doesn't sound good. It's better 3 years than 4 because, you get a job, you get on the college earlier and you accomplish your goals before what you expect.

Most of the kids are looking for end the school early, is a good motivation for the students that they will end the school early. In that way maybe the majority of the teenagers will be more focus on what they are doing, and have a better future. The majority of the people when is young always think about that they leave school because they don't want to end when they get old. That's why I like the idea. Before you finish high school, before you get in the college and you do not finish the university to old. Plus, you have better opportunities and also you don't waste your time.

Even four years is not a bad idea because you do more and you learn more and you can get more information. You have the same facilities even if you finish early or you take more time. Four years Is good but not all the students like to do the same thing in that time and they get bored. Four years is a good option, but three years or less sound better. Both options have a good opportunity to be in a good university. It just depends on what the student wants to do and what decision it will make. ",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5

Some reasons why i disagree are if you don't know anything you cant imagine anything. You might be asking your self why? But the simple answer is that if you don't know anything, you also won't know what to imagine. Without knowledge you can't imagine and create or do stuff.

Next reason is that, I think knowledge counts as experience and experience could save you from getting hurt or killed. I know that if I got burned because I sipped from o mug full of hot coffee, I would not sip from it again until it cools down because I have experienced the burn.

My last reason is that, sometimes when i use my imagination, I use it to create or do something and make it creative. But you can't make it creative if you dont know what creative you are looking for. One example is when i had to make my name out of macaroni and cheese.

That was my reasons and what I think, what do you think? In conclusion I disagree because its just obvious to me that knowledge is more important than imagination. Do you agree or disagre with me?",3.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0

Technology makes thinks much easy and quickly for everyone, If you dont have a car you can shop online. People can buy food, materials, video games, books and everything that in necessary. Technology also makes more easy to talk with people that is far away and you miss. Last year I call my grandmother and she never had a cellphone before, she was surprise that she was talking to me event that she is far away from me that makes me so happy and I was thinking that if technology does not exist I dont know how to communicate whit does people that are far away from me.

Technology is very important this days, for everyone but if we used for good because their is some people that use technology to do bad thinks and that way technology have some negative effects on peoples lives. The limitation of human contact has something to do with technology because there is some people that dont know how to use technology they think that technology is the only way and they feel like there is no other friends but that wrong because technology its a tool for human and if we know how to used its going to makes us life much easy.

In my opinion technology its one of the best tool that we have, but we have to lean how to used because it can helps us a lot and makes us much easy many thinks, but there is only one rule we have to used for good.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,3.0
72635AF44FA7,"Some schools use cellphones in the classrooms for educational purposes. Allowing students use their cellphones in the classroom may have a positive effect in the education of the students, who use their cellphones frequently. In other words, it will make students feel better about doing their classwork. Because it will help students finish their school work or homework, check their grades and assignments, and students will learn better.

One positive effect of allowing students use their cellphones in the classroom is that students will have a chance to finish their classwork or homework. Some students have classes that left many homework, so that means that they may need more time to finish their assignments. Moreover some students have personal issues, for example; Sometimes I can not focus in do my homework because I may have a problem that blind my mind and that makes me feel stressful, and that does not let me work on it. Also some students have jobs after school, for example. I have a job after school and sometimes my tiredness is huge that it does not let me finish my homework, and I can tell that it is really difficult, so having this experience I think that it would be really good that school allow students use their cellphones in the classrooms to educational purposes.

Another reason is that students will have the chance to check their grades or assignments. Some students miss school and they probably does not if have assignments, or they does not have time to check it in home. Most of the students forget easily that they have homework, for example; Sometimes when I get home and I started doing some of my labors and when I notified it is already time to sleep, so they next day I do not have any time to finish it. Therefor it will be good to most of the students check what they are missing during class, and they can probably ask the teacher for permission if they can work on what they are missing. Also ask for help to the teacher if they does not know how to do it, for example; I had a friend that math is hard for him, so he check his assignments in the classroom and ask the teacher for help to understand better, so I think it will help students to get their grades better.

Some people say that the allow of using cellphones can cause a negative effect is because it will distract students, for example; some teachers say that students will be doing something else, like texting or playing video games, in other words students will not pay attention in class. Whatever they are incorrect because students will a better way to learn, in which one they will feel comfortable. The point is make feel that they can learn in an interesting way, for example; Some teachers let students play trivia games on their cellphones, so students can learn and have a good time doing it. They will learn better because most of the things that students look in their phones they are capable to memorize it. May be the pass generations think that the use of too much technology, like allow the use of cellphones in the classrooms is a bad idea because it will make our brains slow is not true it just help us to learn in a better way.

In conclusion, the school allowing the use of cellphones in the classroom will have a positive effect because it will help students finish their school work or homework, check their grades and assignments, and they will learn better. We are the new generation and the future of the next one, we have the help of technology to get a better knowledge. The future is on our hands and make it easy is our decision. They are just finding better ways for us to learn and educate better because they want us to succeed in school, like in our lives. ",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0

732952FF57F2,"For the time students get to high school, Is time for the students to focus more on their future. Students that go to high school are expecting to do more work and be with a different mind set. Going to high school, is the time when students need to think what they want to do in the future, and pick a career that they like. But there are many students, that don't care about their futures, others don't think about their futures in high school. High school is the time when students are able to get focus and think about a career they wanna take. Also to pick a career that you like,and you enjoy doing it. But there are many students that take career just to take them but thats no the career they like so they end it up not achieving nothing.

In high school, is where a lot of students work so they can get money and buy what they want and Also to pay their college career. So identify a career by the time students get to high school help. Because now the students now how much does the career cost, and where he can go studied when he finish high school. Also choosing a career when your young helps, because students have more time to get more information, about the career. And see if there are others career that students would like to take. So thats why committing to a career by the time you get to high school helps you, have more time to view different careers and choose the one u like the best.

Many student that are almost in high school, think about how high school going to be like. So been able to choose a career before high school helps. Because the student can get their mind set and think about what courses the student wants to take in high school. Those courses can help, because it teach the student the things that he needs to learn therefore hes prepare the career, he wants to take. And also to be able to search where the he wants to go studied and pick the collage that teach the best for his career.

And finally preparing for a career before high school, gives the students more opportunities. So I agree for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. also high school has a lot opportunities, for students that wants to take collage course. So they can be prepare for their careers, and when they get to collage they now a lot about the career they want to take. So it helps committing to a career before going to high school it can get you prepare for your future. And acomplish what you want for your future.    ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5
7333B4549006,"Conserving energy and resources is very benifical for human life and nature. Human damage many nature things while making energy and resources for their daily use. For example deforestation, use of water to make electricity, which can decrease the ammount of aquatic animals and water on the earth. Some buisness have adopted the idea of a four-day work week so they can conserve energy and resources. A four-day work week can also effect on thier buisness and put them in loss but it depends on them how they manage their work in four days. But Should schools follow this model by extending the school day two hours and make a four day school week? In my opinion school shouldn't follow this model. student's already have five- day school week which sometime seems very short, when students have lot of work to do and they need more help of teachers. In a month there are some federal holidays in weekdays, Which make a five- day school week more short. Extending the school day two hour and adopted a four-day work week have many disadavtages. It can put bad impact on students study and on thier grades, they will spend their weekend more with friends not with books, Students may spend their times on computer games and on phones. So, four-day school week will effect somewhere in student life. It's better to keep the five-days school week for students goods and for their better education.

Every student study hard in school to get better grades in all classes. Student's always try to learn more from their teachers and do their best in class. But a short week can a put bad impact on their study and their grades will go down. For example when students have an extra time in their classes, they mostly spend it with thier teachers and asking them questions so they can get answers in a specific way. But what if they don't have time in class or teacher's don't have time for student's. If a teacher has a short time to teach soemthing. They will teach in a very fast or a different way to students. Some student's may not get everything in class, and their class performance will go down and it impact on their grades. It's very important for a teacher to spend a time with their students and ask them about their problems in classes, and also for a students it's very important to share their problems with teacher so, they can find a way to solve the problems. It can only happens when student and teacher both have time in class to discuss. so the Four-day week can make a distance between a teacher and a student.

Second, Friendship is a very important thing in every person life, Friendship with a good friend can tell you the path of your success. Spending time with friends is a good habbit. But it doesn't mean that you have to spend you al free time with friends. Almost every studnt spend their weekends with their freinds and they dont care about school study. Even we spend our one school holidays with friends and forget about study. what if we have three days off in a week. Do we spend that time with our books? the answers is no we cannot spend time with books on weekends. We need to spend our times with books and the schhol is the only place where we can learn something and soend times with the books. For example Last week we had an five days off from school and i didn't study in that week and i forgot to complete an project i got bad grades on that class. i spent my time with my friends and i didn't know the meaning of study in that time that's why i got bad grade in that class. But when i have regular week of school i always complete my work first so i can keep my grades up. More school holiday's will give more tension to student that's why they didn't study at home and they would like to study at school. A regular school week is much better than four-day week of school because in a one day we can learn a lot from our teachers at school.

In this century every single person is using technology. Students are using more technolgy than others, spending time on computer and on phones isn't bad thing but you also have to spend some time with other activites like sports, cultural activites. But children doesn't want to do this and they play games on phones and on computers. For exaample I have a younger who's fourteen year old. Whenever he arrived at home from school, the first thing he do is get out his Laptop from his school bag and start playing games with his friends on online group so you can easily estimate that how many school student playing that game on computer and on phones on weekends and on off days. Playing game on wekends and on holidays can effect you and your studies and gives you a bad grades. It's better to be in school than on computer games, so we can learn something new. A four-day school week can make a big difference in student's school life.

At the end, I would say that if school will follow the model by extending school and a four-day school week. It can develop a big difference in student education. Students come to school for learning, sometime they get bored from school. But if school make this rule for student the student will be happy with this but in future they will understand that how wrong it is to make a school week shorter without getting anything and just stayed at home. From more school hours and with regular days student can learn something more and keep their grades up.

They will spend their more times with books and paying attention on the study not games or electronic. So the Four-day schhol week will not work for the school it may only work for the buisness but not for the school. ",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
73851AC4551C,"78% of Americans students do extracurricular activities, by staying after school,doing sports and serving on the student council. This can help students to improve their grades,because every activity count as a grade or extra credit.

Firstly,students should do extracurricular activities because this can improve their grades, if they do extra credit after school teachers can replace a missing assignment for the extra credit. Students can improve their grades in different ways they can do particularly activities like sports, if students do sports they can practice their beneficent for do activities after school. One important thing is that students can receive help from others students or teachers,a lot of students stay after school for receive help especially when they have missing assignments,if they do not understand a topic.

Secondly,students can spend time with their friends, this is important because some students spend their time in technological things like phones,video games and things like that ,others students like to stay after school because they can share time,ideas or comments how they are in their grades,by sharing ideas they can help each other in their work,especially if they do not understand something. They can share and receive help from others they can do work together and when they finish they get free time for their friends.

Thirdly, this is most important because students learn more,they learn the importance of share time with friends,a lot of people have longer friendship because they like to spend time with friends and they do not spend time with a phone. All the kids should do extracurricular activities in school because this can help then in a future,especially if they take importance to improve their grades.

To conclude, every student should do activities after school,this is a benefit for their future and for their learning skills. Parents should be interest in these things because most students have bad grades in their classes and this is an opportunity for improve grades. Doing sports is an activity that can help kids to be healthy and stronger.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5
73930228893B,"I feel like if students want to graduate in three years or two years they should talk to someone like there teachers and they can ask them if there GPA is low.

there is a lot of ways that they can help them for an example if they are failing any classes then they can take some classes online, or if they can go to night school,or stay after school for more help. There is a another way for them they can go to school summer and they can take classes the ones that they fail or take some other classes the ones that they need to take if they don't want to keep on going to school. also if they stay in school, no abuses, and stay out of trouble they can probably graduate in three years.

If there bad grades are low or GPA they can take a another class that can bring up there grade up like, do a sport, like soccer or art. or they can ask a teacher if they can change there class where there where is two teachers.

I feel like my school they should let students graduate with a low GPA because there is some students that have a hard time keeping up there grades up like. If they have a brother, or sister that they have to take care of or they have to work two jobs to help there parents out. but i feel like students shouldn't work while going to school because that how they get bad grades and can't bring up any grades up. what i like about my school is that they let students pass there sol's with a 375 or more the ones that are in small group and that they need more help.

For example when you wanna order something online you dont have to calll you can just order it online with out contaction anyone.

Technology can help you in manys ways. One way it can help you is by if you dont know the answers to a homework you can go on a computer or even a phone and look up answers and wedsites of where your answers can be. Another way is if you need to do technology work need to be done at home you can use a computer and send an email to your teacher without contacting her about it when your done. To me i see this as a positive effect on people because it can help you succed in school and complete things you need to do as well.

There are so many other ways technology can help you as well. when you wanna sign up for soccer you can regrister online. All you have to do is answers qustions put your information and once your done putting your information in you can pay for it and once you pay your coach will get an email that you singed up for his team. Technology for kids is positive when they are younger than 5. Letting them use phones and tablets would be good so they can learn how to say , words , letters, numberrs, and learn new things before they go to school and already know a couple things. So that to me is a posetive effect with technology

For sum people negative effects could also be negative for them also. When a parent dosent know how to use a phone it can be stressfull for them becuase they wouldnt know what to do unless someone is there to help him and do the things the parent needs to do on the one. Also another negative effect is when if you have all work saved in a computer and you get your computer wet and it wont turn on how are you gonna show your boss or teacher your so that would have a big negative effect on the worker. These are sum ways technology can have a negative effect on you.

To me technology has a poseitive effect in my life because I can be able to do more things and not have to worry about and contact people to help me do it. I also beleive for other people it can help aso for like, work, bank, food and more . But sometimes they can also be negative things but negative things also happen in life so its okay for that to happen.

Some students woul benefit from being able to attend classes from home, but just those who really need it, like students with disability or health problems. It would not benefit students whom have a hundred percent of their ability to develop anything, it would make them more lazy than what they normally are.

Generic_Name is a student who has a hundred percent of his ability but he does not like go to school. He is always skiping classes and never make homework. Generic_Name is a student with health problems who can not assist to school like a normal teenager because he has to be connect to a oxygen tank twenty four, seven. Generic_Name does not want to go to school and Generic_Name can not do that. The school which both of them used to attend is offering a distance learning program for students and the first two students who joing are Generic_Name and Generic_Name. If schools decide to create this program for students, them most priorize at the moment to acept students.

Distance learning program as an option for students to attend classes from home. It would benefit thousands of students whom really want to learn and be successful in their life. If schools which have this program available for students allow students like Generic_Name and Generic_Name to be part of it.

Generic_Name would be just one more of those students who are trying to take the easy way for everything, acting like if the world goes around him. But there is also an amount of students who can not have access to enternet or any electronic device to access to the online classes. So it turns a problem for those who does not have acces to any of those things and has health problems like Generic_Name or who does not have enough money to have what they need to participate. The online classes would be hard to them no matter what. If schools created a plan for those students it would be more easy to them to develop themself.

In conclusion some schools are offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home, for students who does not have a hundred percent of their ability, student with health problems, students who really need it. Them also may create a program that help students without enough economy to take those classes.

It is a great idea to take classes online, this is in my openin because it is fafe the students times. Like (work in deffrent time ) (Famileis responsiblity) (Sickness and transportion) work in deffrent time sa we all know that work that may effect the time of students becaue is impossible any work places give the students the schedule that they want it. So after student done from work ,they can take online classes fom home that will make them more relax.

Because after work is hard to focus in the classes but if students take from home they will have time to ate and more fouse. Online classes can give more time to do other activety,like sports, go out with friends.

Sickness,transportion ,Parke if students sick so bad do they can go to school ofcurs not first of all the student who is sick can make the other student sickt too. So that's why the online classes can make the different for students additional sick persons may can not drive too ,and may not all students have cars and parking some time students vhave to pay fo parking too. Frthuer more the wather may not help smoe time to dive to anywhere.

Families responsiblit,it is good benefit from families ,being to attend classes online. Because there we all know may some of students have chidern, or students are disaplelty person ,example disapolty persons can not go bythemsevs to school in the issue the online classes can make for thses students a big different so they can take time off if they are not feel well,and take their pale in the time. And that will help students that don't want to school because of these kind of issue the online class will be btetter for them. Or if students are moter or father, it will be easy for them to kake care of their childern and take classes online . So there will calm in the mind of the students because they will know that wouldn't be missing classes. Hwoevery; they will feel busy in their time but at lest there is options which is online classes. The great benefit of online classes for mother or father that may be they are students is the time.

7600F1C7D884,"Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I personally don't think students would benefit learning from home because you can learn better by being taught face to face, being able to know the ideas of you're classmates, and from being around people who already know enough to help you out. Being homeschooled would be much less stressful than from actually going to school, but if you really want to learn and be a scholar, I think you'd have a better chance going to school rather than learning from home because at home you can get distracted easily.

Being taught face to face is so much easier becasue you can ask as many questions as you need to help you with your problem. also, I think your brain focuses more when you're being taught face to face than from learning through a computer. For me it's so much easier to learn when being taught in person, because I concentrate more on the words the teacher is saying and when its through a computer I get distracted easily because there's no one around to tell me that I can't get up or go to the restroom. I remember this one time in math class I had an assignment I had to do and it was online, I could never understand it until I asked my teacher, personally, after that all the problems that we're similar to that one probelm I couldn't figure out, I did them in seconds and I think thats because I was being taught face to face.

When your in school you're never alone in a classroom because there's always other classmates and when you're homeschooled and it's just you by yourself. I feel like being in a classroom full of other people is better than being at home and learning on your own. Having people around you while your in class isn't always as bad, I know some people get distracted easily and not concentrate while being around others, but sometimes it's good to be around other people because you never know whose around and you don't know if the answer of one those people in your class can help you in any away. Me, personally, I enjoy working with others or even just having people around me, I feel less lonely like that and well I don't really get distracted as easily because I can talk to people and and at the same time concentrate on the work i'm doing, but that's just me i don't know how others are.

Thirdly, going to school is actually fun, you meet new people and you don't have to be locked up in your house the whole day. In middle school I remember that I wouldn't talk to no one that worked at the school because I didn't trust them, until this day I still don't trust them but it wouldn't hurt you to be around them and ask questions about something you need. Having people around you who already have been through everything were going through is very helpful because they know the steps to help you feel better since they've already been through it. Plus, you get more opportunities at school than learning from home, and that's because school can help you achieve you're goal and you're career, maybe not always but they can most definitely give you advice on what you can do to achieve you're goal.

In conclusion, I think you'd learn from home too, but you can learn more from school. This is to the people who homeschool their kids, wouldn't you rather have your kid at school where his safe, getting fed, getting his education, more opportunities on becoming someone in this world, and meeting new people in his life? or would you rather have him at home where his lonely and getting distracted easily? and it doesn't matter wether they're the ones who want to be homeschooled because you're the parent and your in control not them.

772D27D400BB,"It god to have a possitive attitude when you don't have a possitive actitude you not treat god the people and they feel inconforteble. I agree to this statement because when the people have a possitive attitude they can faund a job and to have a positive attitude is very important in life and also to have a god attitude is important in the hausehold.

First: I work in a reusturant and I always have a god attitude with the costumers for example, I now a manager how work in the reastaurent she always have a negative attitude, and I think that is not god to have a negative attitude ,

to have a good attitude help a lot to have a job in my oponion a think that if I have a possitive attitude I can work very well and also a think that possitive attitude that we have is because the parents of as they teach as how we can have positive attitude .

second: I have some friends that they are negatives and that is not god we have always to are positives some people think that is god to have a negative attitude and is not real if we are negative we can do thinks bad , my mom always tell me don't be negative that is not good that why I'm always positive, my grandma always tell me don't be negative .

Third: positive actitude is good to have I think if we are happy we have a possitive attitude all people can have a positive attitude,if people don't have a posittive attitude they can't get a job that's why all people can have a possitive attitude is important if we have a positive , in all the works they need that we can have a positive attitude because in my job a girl how wants to work in their but she just went one day when my boss are treaning her she dosen't have a possitive attitude that's why a think we have to be positive always.

In conlusion if all people wants to have a job they have to learn how to have a possitive attitude if you have negative attitude plis change you attitude the negative attitude is not god in work or in oder things , we need to have positive attitude always , the positive attitude depend and how we traet oder people if you don't want to see oder people sad for you bad attitude be positve, have a positive attitude always .",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0
777CB894A285,"I believe on what Mr. Emerson said about being a master at something but not growing. In my experience In working In construction I learned how to measure wood, cut wood, and Install wood frames and all of that taught me how to be a more efficient person at my job. It also taught me how to use power tools and utilitys and for me I think it's better to know how to do different things like how to change the oil from your car or how to fix something that went wrong In your car like If something went wrong with your engine or If some hoses came loose. I believe If a person just want to know one thing and be great at It that's their right and that is acceptable, but they will be only focusing on one thing. But It's alright because not everyone would have the time or just would'nt want to do It. So I think it great If someone has already mastered something that they really like doing, but I believe it better to know many different things like construction or car mechanic or how to connect electricity wires because I truly believe that knowing many different things can give you more knowledge for the future.",2.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0
77BB33DB5187,"The first impresions

The next text is about ""The firts impresions can change with the pass of time"". The object is give information to the reader about different things that make that the first impresions change, and how can affect. The text is made with examples and support ideas, that help to understand more the theme. Then tell that the impressions can change anytime.

The first impresions is when you current know at someone or something. It is the first opinion that you mind create, but this impresions or idea can change when you start to know better. When we current know a person, our mind create a idea that can be false or true, but is something that only can know with the time.

The change can affect or can benefit, that means that sometimes we thinks that is good and bad, thinks that is bad and is good. A example of affect is when we buy a car, and these is look like beautiful for autside, but when a mechanical check inside descover that have many damage. A example of benefit is when somebody told you something bad of other person, and when you talk with that person you descover that is false.

The first impresions can change for many reasons that our mind create; for example, false opinion, dissapointment, angry, or autocorrection. All these can have influence when you change your impresions of someone or something. For example, when we are angry all is look like bad or annoying. Other example, when we make a autocorrection of something that we believed that was bad or incorrect.

In my conclusion the firt impresions it's very important, no always going to be good or bad, your opinion going to change. I think when you don't know at someone or something is better wait a litte before make a bad or good idea about it. If for that I think that the firts impresions can change while passing the time.",3.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5
77BD30EC277D,"Dear Principle,

My name is STUDENT_NAME. I think in order to help people in community service we should take the time to help people that are in need of help. This would be a great thing to do because it would be helping people. Helping people is a awesome way in showing how much people care about other people.

For an example; if we were to be require to take community service at school, some students would be need of help in math, language arts, science, social studies or anything that a student would need help in and would be able to receive help. This would make our learning increase and more student would be going to college. Parents, teachers, and even students want the best for themselves and with a help that each student could get it would make students comprehend and understand what the concept or subject they are working with. It will also make teaching easier.

Having community service will make students want to be focused in doing good things such as helping students or people and doing things that won't lead them to bad things. Community service will also help the community in having good and safe home and nice people around them. That's why i believe the principle should require community service to each student.

77D210B9EC7E,"Students will benefit from being able to do the classes from home because maybe they have reason to do there or having some problems because some people doesn't like the community or having to many people around them. If I have a choice to choose one of them i think i will choice to go to school to know more people.

These are my three reasons on how students can do the online classes from their home.

The first reason is why students want to do the online classes from their home, because maybe they don't like the people from outside probably they think that all people are bad, they are not nice, mean, in respectful. Probably their parents doesn't want because they scared of how people are going to treat them or they are going to give them a bad influence like going in the wrong life. Or they don't want because her son/daughter are bad having some medical problems they think that the people are going to laugh at them.

The second reason is maybe other students don't like to a normal day of school they probably like to stay at home and taking the online classes from there, because they feel that people are not gonna like them or judging them sometime students don't want to go because maybe they have a medical problems because they feel embarresed or something bad happened when they were at school.

Finally if I choose one of them like staying at home or going to school i will choice to go to school because I will love to help people to explain them that why is important to go to school and giving a advice to them that they don't need to be embarresed if they have problems they just need yo let it go some people don't think if he or she are hurting the person who is bullying them.

In conclusion is that if people choose the online classes and doing at their home they are free to choose because they equal are going to study but at their home they have reason to do there. But i will say that people don't need to care what other people is saying to them.",3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0
77D5466305CB,"Have you ever wonder what would happen if you know more about something you like, something you want to experience, how people can do many things, how they learn how to do a lot of things. Are you impress of how some persons can have more than one career, do you wonder how they make that happen, how they did it, how thwy make it until the end. People who knows a lot of things means that they have been trying differents things. People should try to do more things because trying new things is like an adventure, people learn more things and growing makes you a better person.

Trying new things is like an adventure. When people do something that they did not know or want it to know more about it, they look at that like a new experience, something that they would enjoy to do. My oldest sister know how to make cakes, she thought that was all she can do, but one time I dare her to do a recipe that is famous in my country, ""pupusas"" she didn't know how to make it, but she try, she fail and what she cook was really bad, but she started to practice and try until she reach it. Know she can make pupusas and cakes, but not only that, she was trying to do different stuff, so know she almost have her own restaurant. She demonstrate me that doing more than I know is awesome, that it can teach me new things and that I am capable of doing more than I know.

People learn more things. When people try to do something they start by trying and when they try, they fail and when they fail they learn something new, so next time that they try do not make the same mistake. When I came here I thought I wouldn't learn english and that I wouldn't have friends, but then I thought ""If I don't start practicing or trying to learn I won't be able to communicate with others"" so I start trying and know I speak a little bit more and understand a little bit more. Then I thought ""I need to speak with other so I can practice more"" but I was so scared that people wouldn't understand me but I had to try, and then I start trying to talk with others, now I am not afraid of talk with others enymore, my english is growing and my experiences too. I would be stuck if I hadn't try.

My sister is in middle school, she likes to do sports, she knows how to play some but not others. In her school after school they make clubs about sports. Last semester they had a club about basketball, she didn't know how to play basketball, but she wanted to learn, she wanted to try something knew. She enjoy the club and she learnd how to play basketball, know in this semester they have a club about volleyball, she doesn't know how to play volleyball, but she wanted to learn something more, know she is in the club of volleyball. She learn how to play 2 sports, she is growing in knowledge of sport, if she can play volleyball and basketball that means she can play any sport she likes or wants. She knows that if she wants to success she need to try and if she fail, she need to try again until she made, that knowing one thing doens't mean that's all she can do.

Unless people try to do something beyond what they know, they will never grow. They need to do things to know who they are, what makes them special, what can they do, what are capables of, what can they do, in what they are good, how they feel doing something. Doing something means growing, growing in knowledge, education, skills and more. People who do more than they know, makes them smarter, they try new things, things that they didn't know that they could do. When people want to do something beyond what they know they would fail, but failing doesn't mean you can't do it, failing means you are almost gaining what you want, you are almost reaching your goal, you are doing great, because you know what to do and what not to do. Just because something did not go like you wanted doens't mean it didn't work, it mean something went bad and you don't need to do it again, so next time that you try you already know what not to do. Experiences make people better, growing makes people better, trying makes people better, all person are capable of doing what they want. ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.5

Students who commit to a career at a young age always doing better things in them life, and when students get a old age he or her always know what they have to do because they trust their work when they was young.

Ex: Generic_Name said, when she was a young, she was trust her things and it was always teaching her many thing and shows her what to do and how to be, and many people was care about her, they was not doing them things without her, when they want to do their things, they was waiting her because she was help them and teaching their, and she get an achievement in her life, and reach her goal.

Students having to commit to a career at a young age to get an achiever in future, they doing what their trust, and they always doing what they know because they believe that whatever they trust puting them in a good way to reach them goals.

Ex: Generic_Name said,When she was young, to commit to a career was the best thing that put her in the best way, and believe her thing, when she belive her things, always she was in a good way and it always protect her life, and many people get to respect her, because there are people who was not having an respect to her, and it's shows her what kind of something she have to do that can give her the way to reach her goal.

Coulcaim:Many people said, Students should not having to commit to a career at a young age because it's not important in their life,it cannot help them anything at all.

Therefore: to commit to a career can teaching students nothing in their life, they cannot trust or believe them work or what they are doing.

791AF7B78178,"My position about this prompt is that students should not take the program that allow students to graduate them in three years, because is not like taking normal classes, for example what would happen if students get to take the program that will allow them to graduate in 3 years?

They would have to take more classes in less time:

Because as I read in the prompt there was one part that says ""for students in order to graduate must take summer courses"", and this means that they would not have a break in this time. Not because of the time but for those students that would decide that they would not only risk to fell some classes but also not to take elective classes during summer because that's what this prompt says.

It will be more stressful:

As we all know school sometimes can be stressful but imagine how stressful if for students that graduate in four years as every other normal programs that high schools offer, now imagine how it would it be for students that take programs allowing them to graduate in three years. I'll say they have to work even harder, during the summer they have to take courses in order to be upgraded to the grade the are going to, also a lot of SOL's test will be taking in less time, I'm not saying that those people won't have enough time to study, but what I'm saying is they would have a really busy schedule with all their classes plus all of those tests coming up it wont be easy for them.

The reason that why I used those examples to explain the main idea like this, it was for you to understand that such as that program it can be very difficult for students, not just that but for students that might not be quick to understand new subjects or new units, it can get them stuck in there with no option but to get into a point when they would just give it up and quit because it will get really hard for them. Now that I showed you how hard could it be for students that would take a three year high school program, now it clarifies that theres no need to rush with education and that students should take normal high school program because it wouldn't be so hard as taking the other program that I just talk about, in conclusion students have more changes to graduate with a four-year-program, as long as they keep themselves in track with what they are suppose to do it won't be no problem, and there will be less stress for them, more freedom to take a break when they need to, and enough time to study.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5
7949A941BF0F,"What is success without failure?

I can infer that the mentioned statement Prime Minister Winston had provided has an strong point of view from many perspectives. Human behavior mostly influences in their achievements and failures throughout life. To be able to achieved your expected goals without loosing enthusiasm, and demonstrating resilience is the greatest accomplishment. I strongly agree with the Churchill's statement regardless to the critical role failure plays in life. It gives the enthusiasm every individuals need in order to be successful in life, it motivates young minds to follow their expectations, and provides more knowledge in many cases since we learn from our mistakes.

Accordingly to many researches, individuals tend to give up when they are facing an obstacle in a complicated occasion, that prevented most of society to stop achieving their accomplishments due to the constant fear of experiencing failure. Society has been exacerbating this concept by creating irrational fear in those who are not willing to take risks to become better persons once they seemed to have failed, which leads to the mediocrity of the world.

Furthermore, there are many people who were born in a extremely poor region, yet they became successful persons due to the hard work they constantly showed and the multiple failures they have experienced, that helped them work harder on specific goals, and that have made an enormous impact in many young minds since it exposes how someone could be able to achieved anything they are expecting, if you keep trying. If individuals were to give up in the first try, we would be a world with ignorant in it.

Moreover, It is psychological proven that a brain can effectively works in better conditions, if they seem to be in a place where failure could be the main issue. We, as humans tend to follow other's behavior to feel accepted by society. If we keep encouraging people to practice resilience, they would most likely be able to manage every hard situation in life and would have the courage to keep trying even if they are aware they might fail, in other words, they would be practicing negative reinforcement that is based on failing but being aware they could have rewards at the end.

Overall, Failure plays an essential role in the pursuit of success since it gives individuals the challenge of becoming better human being and achieving their goals regardless to the situation. It exposes how human behavior react with the idea that success is not only one extraordinary idea. Success means being able to manage the situation with resilience and perseverance even if they seem to have made multiple mistakes. It influences in many adolescences, gives the hope of being able to achieved their expected accomplishments and it provides higher knowledge from their mistakes. A successful person is the one who have seem to dedicated their time to be able to greatly achieved their dreams. ",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,2.5,4.0

I had to make a good disagon becouse if I did not then it would have been a wast of $15. one of the book was called Nialarmstrong it talked about the life of Nialarmstrong and the other was called Dog Man it talked about a dog that some how got transformed in to a human offecer cinda like capton americ exapet hes not a super solder. My conclogon is paople should take more then one oppeinon.

I dicided to take my frends Generic_Name oppenion he told me to "" take Dog man it is so cool "" but i feelt like there was something about the Nailarmstrong book. Its always fun learning about other peoples storys and what they did to get to where they are. I did not stop there I wanted anther oppenion so then I want and asked the libarn oppenion she told me "" the nailarmstrong book sounds better to me but your choose to pick out the book that standes out the most to you"" so then i took her edvide and the book that stoude out the most to me was Nailarmstrong. and let me tell you I had a lot of fun reading that book. I evan told my frinds about it and they where like ""can I chick it out"" if i sed no i would sound disrspactful so I said sure ill bring it tomorrow in lunch.

That is what all of the succesful peaple do inclouding the prastent, besniss men, loyers becoase if the make the wrong call they could posibly face some vary big concaconses and if you want to be succeful you will have to be vary careful and take as many oppenions as posoble.

Taking peoples oppeinons could be risky at times but a good tip is to take that risk. What i'm trying to say is takeing a risk is not always bat every thing happens for a reson at lest that is what my parants said. taking big riskes is a part of our lives every human being took a risk at lest ones in there lives sometimes you would not evan know that you took that risk but in realty you did for example im take a risk typing this ovesly the conscances are not that big but they still mater in life.

79AC659EC790,"Many people believe that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. Even if you always are failing in your life, but if you still have a positive attitude you can achieve your goals and be successful.

First, with a positive attitude the people are going to recognize you as a person that always like to fight with positive attitude an achieve your goals. Some persons are always trying to make you negative but you have to keep going and fight for your future. To demonstrate this positive attitude you can achieve your goals no matter what obstacle that life put in front of you.

Secondly, to be successful you need to have a positive attitude. Since the majority of people want the success, but the successful does not come over night. Something the success does not come as fast you would like. So you have to get out of your comfortable place and take control of your life without fear. The most important thing to success is to know what you really want in life and grab it with an attitude.

Sometimes it is not important to have a positive attitude to obtain success. In other words you just have to find your talent and prove in a different way that you can be successful. Clearly not everyone needs to have a positive attitude to have an accomplishment.

Surely having a positive attitude is beneficial to accomplish effectively what your proposes of life should be.

7ACF284A8B7C,"I think that work in groups is more benefit. Because work is groups make the class successful. also, the students can know each other and they can meet new people. therefore, work in groups is benefit for students and teacher. Here are some reason why

I think that work in groups is benefit.

First, They can divide the work in same parts. While someone is working in searching information the other one can think in how to make the work more creative. Also, if they divide the work is more fair for the group so they can have more opportunity to work successfully. Second, They have more opportunity to have a better work. If the class work in group they can do much better in the work that working alone because they can do the work more easily by working as a team. For example, If the class works in groups of 4 they can do a good work by dividing the work in same parts like one can be searching for information the other one can be looking for imagines. The other two can be checking that the writing is good and that the information is good. And the last one can make the presentation and make the work creative.

Second, In groups can take less time to work on it that working alone. If a group meet in one place and they start working they can easily finish the work on time. Also, they can search for information more faster then alone because they can divide the work but they can also help each other. Second, In a group decide what to do it can be hard. But when the group decide what to do and they finish the work fast. The group can check if the work is good or not and decide either to keep the information o to make some changes. So, the group can have more opportunity to have a better grade.

Third, Work as a group can also be fun because you are working with your friends or you can met new people. First, work in group can be a good for class because they can know each other. If the class meet each other the class can be more successful. Because there will not fight or enmity so the class can work more successfully. If a class is works more successfully that makes the topic easy and knowing each other makes the class more understanding. And, It will make the class more fun because everyone can help each other in thing that are hard for people. For example, if one student can't understand the topic he can ask for help to the teacher and he can ask to people around hem for help.

In conclusion, work as a group is funny and make the class better. Also, it makes the students to do better workers and meet people. therefore, I think that work will be better in groups because the class can meet and know each other and they can be better person and better students. This are some reasons why a think that work in groups is better.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5

, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Have you ever wounder why that is the case?, if you are a person who does not take advice from another individual , then you could use this skill, taking advice from another person can help you make better life choices, it will make you understand things more clearly and faster, and learn from them. Multiple opinions really is a foundation to a job like a mayor of a city, it is vital to take advice from the community in order to address problems and concerns. If it was just a city with no voice in the community then the city would fall into a bad place which no one wants to be in and the key advice is to receive it.

In the world we live in, we make a lot of important choices in life, some are big and some are small, but they effect our future and success. Next, advice from others can make you more wiser when you make your own choices, if

Abraham

Lincoln never saw how African Americans were treated for there skin color he would have never signed the documents for slavery to be band. if he never got advice he mostly likely would have never Andres the problems with having that toxic racism. If it wasnt for him, it would still be here today thanks to out 16th President, which boils down to good thinking and advice. At some point in our lives I know we got advice from someone we look up too,also what ever the advice they gave you, is an add on to bigger things, for example if a parent or guardian gives you some advice to never quit on things or problems that are hard and difficult for you, with just that you will Carey that for the rest of your life. Which eventually make you more wiser and resistant to challenges and in life. You will have a mindset that will help you be more successful and a hard worker. When you are at that point you will know what is right and wrong, from advice from your remodel, father, and mother. Multiple opinions is like trying different types of food from different chefs and if you just try it, you will see something you might like, if you never try something you will never see a different possibility taking advice is just like that. Only instead its intellects make the right choice to help you.

In Conclusion, advice is there to help you, opinions are there to guide you to something that gives you smarts to making the right choices in the world we live in live, sure not all opinions hear might not be in your favor.

Students should offer public classes, however, Distance schools will make students careless by doing online or video conferencing. Distance learning is not good because it would make cheat easier, there would be less social interaction, and they would need to be highly motivated.

Firstly, students would cheat easier. For example, If students allowed to use their technology system, It would be easy for them to do their work but It would be easy for them to go online to and copy the answers Some students have trouble working at school because they don't want to work.

some of teens says that they cannot understand to work at school.

Secondly, there would be less social interaction. For instance, when you are taking a test or taking notes at online school there are many distraction that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. Therefore, Learning from public school it won't have distractions that a online has. However, Students won't lose focus on what they are doing if they are only focus on their teacher and if they have questions, they can ask from their teachers so they would help them more. It would be more helpful if students come to school.

For example, one of my friend, she used to come to school, but Furthermore, she stop coming to school, because her teachers won't helped her, she cannot understand well, she got bad grade, and she fail all semesters then she plan to start online school. she got the answers the error words which she didn't know. However, Online school are have much more opportunities than the public schools. online schools have more distractions on what you are doing and get more free time.

In conclusion, students should offer to attend classes because attending to classes are less stressful. Students get more help from teachers. there would be less social interactions, because they won't be distracted by any technology and would be focus on studies. Some students are more interests in online schooling because they get more free time and get more rests than the public schools. I think public schools are more helpful for everyone because you meet new people, learn different experience, you get new ideas from others, and it wouldn't make you stressful.

7C54D7484145,"I think students should not be required to take a arts class . students have the rights to take the classes they want to take . If they like arts classes they are free to take that class . but students that don't like art class do not have to take the class .

For example i really don't like arts classes but i'll still take the class because at my school they do this thing that if we need to retake a curse class then we well have 25% of taking that class or if we don't need a curse class we had the 50% of taking that . It might be the same in some schools or it might be different it others schools. some kids may not like the idea of taking art classes and some may like the idea .

Kds may want to have space to take the class they want and they can't because they are required to take arts class . Like they want to take gym or something like this but i know that some boy's would not like this idea . If some kids do enjoy painting or acting . but some kids do not like acting or painting . They might think that it's boring for them to be in that class .

I know that some kids like to act cool and be rude to teachers that they don't like the class or something like this . That's why im saying that arts classes should not be required to take .

I think the best thing to do is to allow kids to pick their classes that they want to take as an elective class .

it's really the best thing to do in my thinking . Because look at it like this if kids that don't like drama and they don't let the teachers teach because they do not wanna be there . they want be in another class that they really want to be

. that's another thing that teachers have to go though dealing with rude kids .

This concludes my argument about students having to take arts classes . this is for all schools please let your kids to pick their classes . or at least give them one class that they like . like i said at first i really don't like this argument thats happening .     ",2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0
7C5E4E2779BF,"I'm agree with Emerson's restatement, in my point of view or personality I can say that I want to be a different person with another qualities, create other ways to think how big or how much I can do to show to the world my authentic and proper knowledge, when I have to make a decision I don't have to think too much about it, I believe in what I'm doing. When you think to be a real person and someone different to the rest, you need to have a plan that consist step by step and develop that plan in the course of your life to make goals to short time and large period of time, be patient with each little detail that you want to do.

For example:

If yo want to do something that you think that is impossible for any reason, you don't have to leave that idea or goal that you have in mind, remember that all you need is work hard, be simple and don't complain for any problem or reason that tomorrow will have a lot of consequences.

At this time, the people and no one wants to see another person having their own goals or their dreams that they had when they were children. Every single person will try to impress to your attention to turn down your attitude and your positive life, I have too many experiences that I never want to pass that process again, in this world exist all type of people that want to help, to destroy your intention or the ways to see the real things, you're a guide and an example to change the format in this age. When you have a purpose that everyday make changes in your personal life or something like motivation to do anything that that have a great value to demonstrate to you family that they are the base to all of your goals have worth. A big percentage of people want to be rich, and my way to think about it, is that all thing that's material it doesn't have a real value for a great and humble person, the value is something that makes you having a great family, a simple life, because the world need to be protected by several and carefully people that are interesting in show another face to represent a different type of humanity.

Be an individual person is how you you can to do to confront the reality and give another perspective to make a great research in your your period of life to change or keep using that type of life and really cares about what are you doing with an specific and central idea.

I have a positive and big action to say that Emerson is right because nobody wants to be the shadow of any person or leave an opportunity that will make the life of one or more person to decide to experiment a new way to see the society and doing the correct process to be an excellent human with integrity and feeling of better life.

My conclusion for this restatement is that I want to be myself with great intentions to form an integrity in this society and have the best recognition to prove that it's possible to make and develop a proper identity with a new perspective to imagine and be the next person in the world that makes you a connection with your interior and have peace to concentrate in own goals that will converting on a genuine person to be autonomous of your acts, be someone responsible, charismatic and all of these characteristics define your personality it doesn't matter where yo come from or where you at, just be an example that if I can do this, you can do it better than me and better as you want.

7CB712FD1253,"There are some some school's that offer 3 years to graduate but then there are some school's that are still doing Traditional way's of the 4 year's of high school and in my opinion is that it is good to graduate early and go to college or the work force but it also depends on the person thats doing all this work to graduate high school or the evenings or night school but people still do it and its good. The people that are doing all this work are hard working people who want to follow through with there ideas and dreams in life and they are paying good for it by studying and working hard throughout high school and they keep on working hard to reach for there goal outside of high school. In my opinion It's a great idea to finish all of high school within 3 years because that's hard work paid off but some people believe that if you stay in school for an extra year that makes you smarter but in some sense that could be true but sometimes people stay the extra year because for 1 they sometime's stay because they fell behind and sometimes it's because they need one type of class for college but in reality the people who did the 3 year's of high school are the truly advanced one's because they did everything within 3 years and its good for them.

if these people go into the work place they have a higher chance of getting the job that they want because they have a high school diploma and the fact that they graduated school early so they that as an advantage for them when they find a job and most jobs are only looking for people that are either in high school or have a diploma because some job's just want people with brains so they could work smarter and not harder but the truth is these people are doing everything to make a living because they worked really hard in high school now they're working really hard at a job and now they are succeeding in life because they were smart and graduated earlier then everyone else

In the case that going to college after graduating the three year's are also good because they want to get into a field of a type of job that they wanted and now they're working even harder for it but in reality its working smarter not harder because they are studying for a career that will give them more money no matter what because they are studying for 4 more years to achieve there dream of becoming something in this world and they are smarter by doing that because a dream job is one of the thing's everyone want's and its good to have a goal in mind.

In my conclusion is that going to college is the better one because It's working smarter not harder and that's the better idea instead of working hard and not being able to get paid enough like the people at the college do so in my state of fact that college if the better choice to go with out of high school no matter if you did 3 years or traditional 4 years of high school the best choice is after high school to go to a college or a university that makes life better in the end for everyone. Some people like to chose the route of hard work but its truly good to head to a college or university after school is over fo0r this person.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0

Everyone has the opportunity to live however they want by taking the decisions they want , if they have self-reliance , they don't need no one to tll them what to do.

People should make their own decisios, even if they are not sure, because if they are making a mistake they can learn how to do it good, they will feel secure, which is impoirtant to take future decisions, and they can find out what matters in life by themselves.

People make a lot of mistakes in life by taking the wrong decision , but that's not bad , it is just a way to learn hot to do the things rigth, a lot of people look for experts when they have to take a important decision, because they are afraid of take the wrong decision, and there's nothing bad with it, but they should trust themselves before pay someone else to tell them what to do , or what decisions take.

When people take the rigths decisions by themselves they feel secure about what are they doing ,so they earn self-reliance to make future dedcisions, and even if people don't take the rigth's decisions , they learn from the mistakes, to take the corret decision in the future, with no help from the experts.

Why should someone else tell people what really matters in life ? People don't need guidance to find it out , they should take tehir time to analyze what really matters in life , they should take their own decisions about what matters , because people is different one from others , so they should take their decisions about what really matters in their lifes.

Is the best option for student to commit at a young age for there career in high school. The Student could be more expert in their own career when they young. They could be much better and more expert when they keep doing there job every day at work. Also, they could get payed even more for working with the company they like. Even is fun for them to work because they give them the option to what to do in their career.

If teen start their courses they will have to try hard to reach their career. they have to be tested how they do if they are in their real job. If teen fails that means that they will not do good in their real job so they have to try again so they could could pass and go to their real job. thats good because you still young and you could still work and make more money then others. So that good to start their career when you young.

Some teens disagree that is a good idea for student to commit to a career at young age. Teens say's that student have to look for more career if they don't have one. while some say's that Teen will start doing there career as soon as possible when they study their own career in high school. Starting your career young is the best for money, you could make more money as you get older. Also, starting your career young is the best for your life. when you get old you will have to quite your job because you will not be quick, and knowing what to do.

as a result, this is important for teen to start their career in high school because they could start doing there career a soon as possible. Teen start there courses they will have to try hard to reach their career. teen could be more expert at their career. This is my opinion to teen.

Some people think that working in groups helps them be more productive and helps them get the job done easier. There could be teachers who wouldnt support the idea of working in groups. If you're trying to convince your teacher you have to have examples to support your position.

Working in a group is more productive and easier it gets the job done quicker then you expect. You can assign each classmate your working with a job duty. One of each classmate can work in drawing, writing, searching up facts about the assignment and not least but last the leader to put everything together and help his classmates when needed. There can be minor things when working in groups. You could expect some who would do there job and just take advantage of time and not be productive. The leader is expected to get there classmates to work and not waste time.

When working alone instead of in groups there can be advantages. Like Having more time in the assignment and not rushing into it. You can have your own ideas without others forcing you to change it up into something they all like. When it comes to mistakes you can point them out yourself and correct them. Instead of stressing about who is not working and who can't get the job done you can work on your own. There could be problems too like not having enough time and can't get your job done as quick as you need it to be. There is other classes to worry about.

Some teachers wouldn't support the idea of working i groups. Instead they would like for you to work alone to get your job done easier. But not every student would support that idea of working alone. Some students could be left back and behind from class so they would need the help from his classmates. There is supporting ideas on why it would be so much better in groups and it would be to get the job done easier and faster. Being alone isn't very helpful when you need the help you do.

Working in groups would not just help students but teachers on grading your work. It can be stressful for them when it comes to working alone and having so much papers to grade. The idea of working with other students would be much more easier and productive. It would feel way better for you and other classmates.          ",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0

But having a positive attitude is good because, If you are a positive person other people would like to be around you more, You will feel better and in a good mood most of the time, You could help others do well in work or even if they feel down or without motivation. It also helps in your daily day. A good attitude is great for everyone and it shows the real you.

Having a positive attitude is good for you and others. Many people are depressed and being around someone with a positive attitude makes them feel better and more confident. An example of this is if your friend is going through a hard time and you help him or her or even talk to them positively about the issues they will feel better and even could possibly start getting a better attitude. Just because they getting the support or talk they need by a close friends with a good attitude. So people even feel so much better about them self whenever they talk to someone about their problems.

A positive attitude helps a lot on your daily basic. Let's said you and you wife or husband argue. All you would need to do is think positive like about good memories or moments together. I'm pretty sure if y'all love each other the argument won't really affect anyone. Another example if you have a good attitude people at work would love working with you, People at school would love doing group work with you. No one likes to work with a negative person so why ruin the party when you can share positively to other. Many good things can come out of having a positive attitude.

However, A lot of people would believe that not having a positive attitude is the key to success, They are wrong because a lot of things could happen when you are a negative person. Such as being depressed, losing motivation to do almost anything, making bad decisions, not like being with others, and not liking things you use to do. All this reason could be because of a bad attitude. But soever if you have a positive mood everything would feel so much better and you gonna have better days and other would respect you because of your attitude.

In conclusion having a positive attitude is good for everyone and it makes people life better. Because of the good moods, helping others and yourself, having better days. And it just makes life so much better and easier. No one deserve to be negative or even mean to others. We all created equal and we all live in the same world.

In this essay I would talk about why is important to learn others people experiences. In my point of view, learning the experiences of others is important, because you learn something that someone had already commit that mistake and they tell you not to do when you grow.

First, one person that had shared their experiences with me is one of my friend. He had tell me plethora of experiences that he had when he was young. One of the experiences that he had tell me. Is that when he had the same that I have, he use to go out of the house without asking permission to his parents. Almost every week he used to lived the house without permission. One day, he realized that he was doing something wrong, so he stop going out of the house without permission. He tell me his experiences, because he want me to learn that is your are below 18 you still have to ask permission to you parents to do anything.

Next, when people had tell you their experiences that they had when were young. You already know what not to do when you grow up, because someone had already tell you not to do it. Maybe your grandfather, parents, friends, e. t.c. had tell you plethora of their experiences that they had. They tell you does experiences, because they don't want you to commit the same mistake that they did in the past. In addition to, they want you to do better them what they did in their best moment of life.

Furthermore, they want you to do successful in life. One day, you are about to do something wrong, but then you realized that someone that you know did it before, and they had already tell you that it didn't went well. Then you stop and you think what happen to that person that did the same mistake you were about to do. In conclusion, maybe when you were young you did something wrong. You would shared that experiences to your children, grandchildren, and others, because you would not like them to commit the same mistake. Even that someone had already tell you not to do it.

Finally, in my point of view learning the experiences of others is important, because they don't want you to do the same mistake. First, one person that have shared his experiences with me is one of my friends, he had tell plethora of experiences because he dont want me to get in trouble as he used to be when he got the same age that I have.

Its easy for people to choose a character for themselves either a good or a bad character. Having a good character shows that you are a good person, but if you decide to have a bad character people no longer will trust you and you will be worthless to others, so this is why we choose our own character.

We choose our own character because our character is based on how we interact with other people. Some people dont have a good character and that's why people neither wants to trust them or talk to them. Even in the movie no one likes the the bad character because they are mean, bad, and no good to others but to harm them and put them in danger. A coworker of mine was very rude to customers. He was always mad therefor no other employees wanted to talk to him. One day a customer complained to the manager about how he was being rude to her, so the manager decided to fire him from his job.

We choose our character based on how we dress. people can present themselves as neat person by the way how they dress in public or anywhere else. If a person has a job interview and he wants to look good then he has to wear a dress that fits his character and makes him that he wants the job. A few years ago my uncle was invited to a wedding party but he wasn't sure what to wear, however some some of his friend told him to wear something casual but that didn't fit his character because he was a boss of a company, therefor many of his coworker would see him there so he decided to wear a suit because it was best for his character.

We choose our own character by the way how we talk to other people. For example if my brother speaks to others in a good manner people will always respect him. Being nice and respecting others will represent a good character of you. It is very easy for someone to change their character, whatever you choose to be that will be your character. Having a good character is very important in our everyday life, furthermore having a good personality will also effect a persons character so in order to have a better character you need to have a good personality.

Some people say that we can't choose our character because it's beyond our control, however choosing your character is not hard you just need to have a good personality and have to be nice to others. Most people that we don't know how to choose our character traits, therefor choosing a good character do not need any special skills. All a person has to do to have a nice character they have to dress properly they need to have good manners and don't be rude to others and this is all it takes to have a good character. Other people may say its hard for us to choose our character traits because we are not able to, however for some people it's hard but the things that a person does in their everyday life those things chooses their character it determines if they have a good character or not.

First of all some students wont like this change because,in the winter time it can get really cold ,so the students wont be able to go outside,walk,nor play. Also one of the reasons they wouldnt like the change is that i summer break they can be outside and go out places. In the winter could get really cold and the students stay outside for a long period of time they might get a could and miss some school days and affect them. If they miss schools days they will be behind from the class.

In the other hand some students might like that idea because in the summer time it can get really hot outside .If its really hot outside people can get dehydrate ,but for other reasons summer days can be some amazing days. Some benefits of summer : going to the beach,amusement park,camping,and travel. Reasons that students will like to have more summer vacation:more vacations days,nice weather to go outside, go to the pool,explore nature and helps them to stop using technology.

If this change in vacations happen I wont like it,because I like being outside in warm weathers and i woulld hate to have less summer break and more winter break .Plus I hate when we dont have school when theres a snow s day. I

like how the vacation time is right now because everyone can enjoy some vaction in the tie that the like the best . I am aslo sure that most of the student will like to keep the same time of vacations beacuse they want to have more not less

In conclusion the time of vacation will not change because the students will prefer to keep the same one .They will like to enjjoy the time not hate it. My point is if the studdent dont like the new time they will problobly wont like to g back to school and just ingnore it. So if they want to change the time talk to the student if they are ok with it ,if not then make a solution about it.        ",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5

80F9E6D6503C,"do you think that these classes should be electives or a core class?.I say that it should be an elecitve because some peole are taking it as electives and so they cahn graduate on time thats why i say they should make theses classes go for elecitives and kids will like more drama and art and or music classes. more than core classes cause core classses are required for gradutaion and the elecitves are for fun and i think that the school should give these classes as an elecitve because it will be fun to learn new things and explore what you would be good at.

some people may believe that you should take a music class,or art class,or drama class however; i believe That those classes should be electives cause their less important then the core classes. but at the same time it would be fun to have one of those classes. and so you expiernce something new. and you get to meet new and differnt people and thats why it should be an elective.",2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,1.5
81D266D94D6D,"Do we get astonished when people behaviors change over time? This makes us surprised and wonder because of their first impressions to us. I disagree that, first impressions are almost impossible to change. People changes all the time just like how the world moves every second. First impressions are possible to change. A behavior is a conduct of oneself in a particular way. A person's character is similar to how a pregnancy grows. When a woman is pregnant, you may be unable to tell but as times goes on, it is definitely going to show.

People hide their true and real behaviors to get what they need or want.

In today's world, struggles and difficulties are playing a very huge role in modern societies. Needs are the most crucial things in life. Some examples of needs are shelter, clothes and foods. We need all these to survive in life and we are going to lack something necessary, desirable or useful when we have no one to provide all those needs. So a person can act in a good way when you meet them for the first time because they just want to accomplish some goals. Last time, I was watching a Ghanaian movie with my family. In the movie, a man named Mr. Bright was very poor. He couldn't cater for his wife and three daughters so, he decided to deceive every rich or wealthy woman he meets the first time. His first impressions to them was to act and brag as a wealthy man who travels to foreign countries to hoax the women and get some money to cater for his family. You see how poverty makes a person behaves? So first impressions are possible to change because some factors affect humans all the time.

Sometimes relationship issues and depressions makes people behaviors change.

Marriage is a union between two people in which no one can separate that. No one gets married to his or her nemesis so bad pressures from our partners affect our characters. Depression makes people sad, causes difficulty in thinking and concentrating. Two years ago, I met a girl called Generic_Name. She was so isolated and sad. I decide to ask what was going on. Immediately I began to talk, she shouted as if I was a monster but later on I realized she was being bullied by some guys in our school. So the counselors helped her out and we became very close friends. I realized she was very respectful, kind and good. So how we see people for the first time doesn't mean that is how they are. People change all the time.

Peer pressures and bad friends make people characters change to a different level.

You will meet a person who was respectful for the first time but later on, you will find the same person talking back and arguing with their teachers in a very bad way. Bad friends are the worst thing in life. They can affect your future and perspectives. A girl who was very shy to talk in my class became the most disrespectful student in our class all because she joined some five bad girls in our school and after that, she decide to live the life she wants which was very bad. Our teachers know the road to success so they have to be respected and treated in a very nice way. No teacher wants his or her students to fail and every teacher wants to be awarded by the good efforts of their students. First impressions are possible to change all the time.

""Every coin has two faces"" so, we must deal with people in a very pleasant, patience and respectful way. A person may be good at the first time but changes later whiles a person may be bad at the first time but changes later because some factors like needs, depressions and poverty are affecting them. How a person behaves the first time you meet them may change all the time. And if we understands how the world is moving every seconds we all going to get peace!

Being confident in what you're doing is great but what if you're too confident ? Not everyone has the same definition of success; Your vision of success might be their way of seeing failure. By setting your goals low, you're taking the potential risk of not attending the necessary capacities expected from you.

When aims are set high, you are also sure to achieve your marks, have the pride of succeeding and be confident in what you're doing, this affects your mood too, therefore you are happy in how well you are doing, have the desire too do even better.

The science fair is coming up this month; Doing a project on volcanoes sounds like a good idea, you're familiar with the subject and have done it before, teachers love projects that demonstrate real life actions, all though; This idea is unoriginal and five other students are thinking the same way as you are, by doing the volcano project, you would be aiming low, you must get out of your comfort zone in order to achieve your goals. Choosing another subject for your scientific project without being boring and using a real life causes would impress the judges, give them useful information without being too specific.

By setting your aim too high you are taking a risk and could possibly fall short, but by aiming low you are closing the opportunities of going bigger and doing something you wouldn't normally do that could lead to potential Utopian future of yours.     ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5.0,4.5
82F9FDBD6F98,"My argument about the 10pm curfew for teenagers statement; is they should have a curfew for teenagers because it can get them out of trouble, and make it home safe and they can get rest for school.

Example of staying out of trouble is you can get mistaken at night; and get hurt just by not going home at the right time. Another example a teenager can be at there friends house and if they leave late or outside with there friend, anybody can be outside and would want to hurt them or there friend because it's dark out, but if you have the 10 pm curfew you can leave without worrying about being in trouble. also can have a guardian to pick you up when its late so this scenario would not happen.

Another reason is to get some good rest for school and have lots of energy. If you do not have enough sleep, but can have the 10 pm curfew to help you to get some rest and will also help you concentrate in school. An example for this is a teenager could be outside and they do not have a curfew so the teenager comes home late. And does not get good sleep or no sleep and goes to school tired and can't concentrate.

A good counter claim for both is you can just stay home and don't have worry about a curfew or going home really late. because if you are scared to go home late or can't get some rest just stay home. You will be more safe home with a guardian or sibling then outside in the dark and not knowing who is outside. And parents should just be more protective so they don't end up going home late. And they can stay home and sleep earlier and get lots of rest for school.

with both arguments i think the best for teenager is that they should have a curfew just for safety reasons. And no parents should be worried or scared for there kids being outside late because there city council do not have a curfew. And another reason is they can get good sleep for teenagers is very helpful for them so they can have a lot of energy and concentrate in class better and get good grades.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5
833489139971,"Former British Minister Winston Churchill once said that 'success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Many people are not perfect and fail, and some think failure is bad. Failure is actually good, because it teaches you what was wrong. Although some people may think that failure does not play a role in success, it should be known that failure dose play a role in success.

One of the reason failure plays a role is that people can learn from their mistake. when people fail they can find out what went wrong instead of giving up, Another reason is failure makes people stronger. A lot of times failure may cause people stress, and stress makes people strong and not give up. Also failure helps people become better people. leaning from there failure.

Although some people think incorrectly that failure do not play a role in success it should be know that it dose play a role in success, because you can lean from your failure, failure makes you stronger, and failure makes you a better person. people should not give up when they fail, they should learn and try again until they succeed.

If they want to do that the rule said is they decition,or they opioniom because they are freedom right, but i am disagree with thus rule for one reason, that it's. That if they don't want to failure you have to fight for yours dreams for everythink that you can do it, and say thank u god for give me that opportunity and say i am so pround of me.

you never give up just kept going and follow your dreams to have a good future and don't be failure and don't play with that things beacuse you can practice once and you can take that thing for a while of your life.

I will give you one example for this thing, you see the poor people that they follow the rules just for money or do whetever things just for money is because they just wanna a good future for they kid's and they don't wanna failure they just fight for they kid's to have a good education and they hope that one they they can be somebody profetional like doctor and help them family to get out the situation of poor.

I hope that everyone in this world can see the right things and complete and don't be afraid if you don't do nothing bad why you suppost to be afraid you have your right laws. If you play wiht that thing you can fail in your life, but you can learn that way because when you broken down and you say i can't continue with this, is when you have to say i am stronger, the life give a leason, and i learn about that. Now i see and i can be better.

You can see now that you can do it. When you wish something like be profetional, soccer player, but if you play with failure you can fail thats right you can not have to play wiht that.

Also there is going to be peoples in your way that they dosen't want that you can be happy, like a fake friends, and sometimes we were really surprised because someones in your family are fake too, but don't pay atention to them just focus in your dreams and finish.

Another example is my self because when i came in United States, i don't even know English and i thoght that will be more difficul for me, i thoght that i will fail every class, but is not how was i thihk because i just focus in my class and i work hard every single day, and i never fail one class that's right you never have to loss the enthusiasm in your life and enjoy every single day, because the life is just one and we has to make the most of opportunitys in this life, and be happy every single day.

When i came in United States without my parents i thoght that will be more difficul for me, at the beginnig was so hard because i always live with them but i never give up because i know that they want a good future for me and i saw that way and now i juts want to help them because they are a good example in my life they say to me, son just fight for your dreams and don't worry about us you know that will be ok and that's right i never loss my enthusiasm because i want to reversed the help that they give me one day.

My father and my mother say, you arer the reason for work and fight so hard for you. You will have a good future don't be afriad don't loss your enthusiasm. That's right i never loss my enthusiasm because i take the example that they give me because i wanna be a good example for my childrens and be like my parents or better.

When you have a problems to solve and you feel that you can fail just think creatively about different ways to solve and actively work to balance your mind, health and emotions or enthusiasm. we have to develop many ways to solve the problems.

83C48C5697AE,"Living in a place with frequentely hihgest demand to provide my best, is one the must important achievement. I agree with Emerson statement because with the individuality we can reach all our goals.

It is to important for me to recognize that i have to get my goals with effort. Because this help to provide, work hard, competition, and bocome the best .Individuality is a good factor to trust in my self to be the best because help us to look for option that help our lifes

.Working by my self make me work hard. when a person work by his own company he try to do a great work fixing everything it is the such as work alone, if you work alone yo going to do a perfect job to impresione others labors .For example, when i work without partner, i try to do a great gob to be one on the best workers. When i do my own work i feel excite cause, i could receive an award for be a good producer. everybody want to be award for their job so everrybody wish a reward. But to be award we have to hsave capacity in the jobs Many person due the same thing like me cause doing my the own work provide a big result. So working by my self make an emotion to work hard and to increase the amoung. Consequently to do a individual work make a good results. Doing own projects workers show more production In the factory and result good Therefore this help to get alot resources by workers.

Competiton is a ways to decrease the teamwork. individual competition is a big example of overcome. Examples could be when a person start to work in his job and start to recieve more money because the person is doing a great work ,this make that others poerson get mad so in the factory start the competition cause everyone want to recieve more money and they thick is unfair be reciving the same amoung of money so they start to argued why the manager give more money to the new guy but the thing is that he has a good specialization in the job. concecuently Many time the work competition provide a good production in the factory so, everyone want to get their goals like a good amount of products also,big accomplishment occur with the worker is trying to find a new way to get more product than other. For example, when a worker finished his assignment could receive free time,this make feel angry other workers so , they are going to try to look for others forms to produce more than the winner because, they want to receive the same reward for the production . To do a good competition the work have to be alone to and with big group people. competition is a good way for individuality work to provide a emotional affect. In many companies the owners look for a way that workers produces a lot and they offer money or free time to the person that make more products .as result, being in a factory with many labors working seperated make a big impact where everyone want to procud the most materials. Therefore,challenge could be a a good idea for separated jobs .

Looking for an accomplishment to become the best. Every one in this life want to have something to be recognize in this world althogh,to be a succefull person we have to work hard. Not matters what tell about us such as critique,bullying ,etc. The only thing that is important for us who we are. So the best thing that could can happens in our life is be a place where frecuently we are demand to do different things. Although with many problem we have to be patience and support all bad things. Because,if we wish to be different than the rest of persons and realize our goals. thought must be working by our selves. Because sometimes nobody is with us to provide help. fighting by my self i could be a big man in the socierity. Currently in the world we have many competition one example can be soccer,almost the majority look in the tv .Soccer is a game where a team have 24 for player. They have to compite who is the leader in the team. So like in the real life the leader is the person that work hard,help the other players .Otherwise, could be a leader in a company, to be the leader of a company ,the leader had to compite with other person that wanted to become a big leader ..Therefore to be a person succesfull have to take individual decision .

Being in a world where have to take decision and concern about goals is the best thing that we can have to show our capacity. Doing my own job make me put effort and dedication. Work in gruop is affect by bet. Being a different person than others. The person that different quality could be someone that can help. Because, this kind of person make the differences in the world trying to win in a place where the competition and the demand are in high level ,so they try to have imfluences in the in their jobs. The individuaity help alot in the world to be a succesful place. For example in the govermen there are many people with a big level to compite with other this, that means it i s has a great achievement in the government,so i agree with Emerson statement cause the competition provide good benifit for us and too the progress of the government,factory,countries,therefore being a part with competiton meke us to improve our best",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5

Teachers are usually very open when it comes to help but most students are afraid to ask, with this club it will be easier to ask for help from the teachers.

I dont see a lot of cons with this idea but i tried my best find some, some students are fairly slow learners and it usually takes up time to teach them, its also hard for the student to be engaged in what there learning. most students have after school activities other than the homework club. Like sports and might arrive late to there activities.

There might not be enough people to help, though i doubt that there wont be enough people to help it may be possible but in a different way after school or work people are usually tired and dont have enough energy to stay engaged in learning or teaching.

Back to pros ya know the good stuff, mental health almost every student goes through a faze where the stress levels are high but most of that stress comes from is school work, with the club teachers will be able to helps students with home work, students will be used to asking for help.

Community service is helpful because you can help people in the hospital and you can clean the streets. By helping people in the hospital, you can help people that are sick and in the streets you can help clean up from the parks and the street floor.

856351253492,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Will if you try will you be able to grow more? Does it matter what you eat? What can you do about you height? I disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because i dont think that you can make yourself taller. He say if you try will it even work? I still think if you try it wont work because the height we have now is because our father in heaven made how we are now.

First, it doesn't matter if you try or not your height and how you look it comes from your parents genes, and it can also come from another family member. I don't think that you can do anything about your height because it depends on your family too. Even if you try you all you can do is to try to have a nice body, but about you height i don't think you could get taller then you already are. The only thing that can change is your body what i mean is if you chubby, over weight you can do excuse so you can have your body the you once wanted to have. If you really skinny you can eat a little bet more, but if you like how your are now you dont have to change anything. But like i always say ""Love yourself and how you look no matter what people say, the only one who could change you is yourself.""

Second, I don't think you can make yourself taller because there is no way that you can become taller then you already are , and don't you think that the really short people will be taller by now then shorter.

I think that they would not like to be short because in this world there is really mean people that will laugh about others, or how they look, and how short they are. So that is why I think that there is no way to make yourself taller.

Don't you think that short people will be short, and be laugh at no they would not like that son that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson.

In the other hand, it does matter to eat healthy so you can be in shape and you will be in this life longer. Normally you can do anything about your height because trust me if you could i've been taller by now. I don't like to be short because sometimes i get judged by my height, or how i look, and how chubby i am and i would like to have everything perfect like all those ladies and girls in the magazines or in the TV shows, and i would like to be 6 .3 ft tall then 5.3 ft. So yeah they is no way to change how you look , but by fixing yourself like: Appalachians, surge, and other things you understand what i mean right.

So that means that i still disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because there is no way that people can make them self taller because even short people or person will be the size or shape they will like to be. This world is not that perfect because if it was everything or everyone will be how they world want to be in this world. So that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson as you can see i give reasons and examples.

This goes to the person that ready's my story please give me a changes to pass just one i have never pass an SOL before and i will be really happy if you could pass me just once in my life. On this one i have tried my really best so you could understand me what am talking about.

I agree with Emerson to be right when he wrote everyone can do eny things, but not every one wants to work hard to do.

Example.

In my personan I think to have my own helicopter in the future.

But i have to work hard to get them ,because nothing come easy ,everything have price first then came be true, But I can't lose nothing to try ,try and try becouse wiil be successful In the future.

Even if I see now only in my dream and, dream in my future it's already mastered.

The people never grow because they fear to try, to do some bighest or highest is the most enemig byself .I can't grow more toll,but I tread believed in my self and first God, will be grow me in wisdom that is my best part I can't do by mayself,the first thing to is to have good health, and my family to.

I'm agree with churchill' because the statement is important role not always your won when the people has a goals , each time when we try something new, we will able to success the first time but the problens is to how your work for you not failure on your life. when you start everything is enthusiasm only you know how work going for the future you cant not failure.

Second ereason, the british prime ministern say that because maybe he do something and he try to do with different ways. The

British look at for you wan to have something good or other thing is when you start but the first thing is when you failure because not always your won on your goals but if you want to mejories your own life, you need to focus on goals and them you will have your success on life. When you get a success, your was enthusiasm.

Last reason, I see if you want to be successful on your high school or in your job you only need is beleive in your self.

Because you was enfocus at 100% when you wannt or need something tat was be more easy for you beacuse you work really hart for take a success because when you have success you was a enthusiasm and them you try to work more and them in your future was more success.

conclusion. to the british say that is really important because not all of person want to work hart for won and them take success.

I know parents say that its good to be in any type of sport but you have to like its because it keeps you out of trouble well its true i mean if you change this policy you might see this straight student go from a good student to always calling his/her patrol officer to see if he/her doesn't have any type of weapon's please TEACHER_NAME think about how this is going to affect the students and our community.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
861349CA778E,"The reason why the school board shouldn't add hours to school because students already go to school to much and they would like more time off of school so they can do their homework, hangout with their friends, play sports out of school, and get more time to do their chores around the house.

The school board shouldn't add more hours because if students have appointments then they will have to put a later time but if the place of their appointment closes a little early then the students will have to leave school and that will make them have missing work, late work, more work to do at home with little amount of time, and more stress for the students to finish the work on time.

If the school board adds hours it will become a disaster for the students that have a job and need to get there in time also if they live far from their job their boss could get mad at them for being late and if they dont belive their worker they could get fired and then the student won't have a job, they won't get paid, and they won't have money to pay for what they need.

This is why the school board shouldn't add hours to school. ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5
876DD6D022A9,"Do you feel confident comes from achievement or for praise? People are concern about the students must be self-confident in order to learn and other thinks that self-esteem come after you achieve something. People might think a lot of things but this is my opinion; to achieve something you have to be full of self-confident. Some examples could be people have to have self-esteem in order to work hard and learn new things every day or once in a while, people have to be confident and positive in order to get something done, and confident is feeling sure about what you are about to do.

Succeeding in something is a great achievement but if there is no confident how can you be sure what you. First, people have to have self-esteem in order to work hard and learn new things every day or once in a while. For instance, there are some jobs like a doctor they never stop learning new things because at some moment a new disease will appear and new medicine will developed. Learning a new language, being someone who knows Spanish and want to learn English is pretty hard. Why? Some words might mean the same as the do in English but all of them do. One word in English might mean five different words in Spanish and some words aren't even similar. You will never gonna to achieve to learn the whole language no even the native can but you will build a confident inside yourself knowing that you will never going to be done with it but you will be learning everyday new words. Secondly, you have to be confident and positive in order to get something done. For example, anger doesn't let someone to concentrate and it lead to chaos. When the final days of school comes and the exams and SOL arrive slowly and you are feeling unprepared for it. The confident that you put yourself every day to come to school even if you feel bad is the one who will keep all your information and it will help you in your nightmares that is those big tests. If you study for a long time then when the time arrives, you will feel ready to pass it. Thirdly, confident is feeling sure about what you are about to do. When trying to find a new job at any place but you don't know how is going to be like or how they are going to receive you. You have to be sure about yourself and letting your confident falls over your fears because with fear nothing is possible. Because you won't have any clue about what is going to happen in that first meeting and those people who will hired you have to feel like you are really to do the job. They won't choose you if they feel you are not really and no have confident to do well the job.

However other people think that self-esteem come from achievement. To begin with by achieving something, you are getting what you fought for and self-confident come as the result. For example, achieving something is no that easy. You have to make a mix of all the things you have to include to get it. When you are at school, it is so easy for old people to think that students just have the obligation of going to school and nothing more at all. Studying it's not just passing classes but it's about learning things for the next day. SOL is a good example of it; teachers prepared us for about eight months to pass a test that is no that long, the problem is that it's not just one SOL but many of it no including the exams. The satisfaction of telling yourself that it is over and summer is coming, there are no more worries about next day because you have fought for eight months to pass it. When you pass something, you achieve it somehow. But what if the SOL is failed twice won't that prejudice your next year. Secondly, after achieving something, usually that person feels joyous for the reality that it's over. For example, if you study so hard for the driving test the night before and feel like you know you are going pass it. That's happiness in yourself but what is you fail, all the effort for the last night is not over yet because you have to do it again until you pass it. Let's pretend that you pass it in the first try, well, you achieved it and you are happy because it's over and now you are getting closer to get a car and drive by your own. Your confidence will grow high because if you did it at a first try then you can do anything that you feel afraid of. Lastly, a positive person is someone who is full of joy and feels confident for what it wants and it's there to fight until it's achieve it. For instance, in all the world there are always different kinds of people: positive and negative. Learning a new job it's so frustrate because at the beginning you won't have any idea on what you are doing. Positive people always think that everything will go right and they tell themselves that they will end up knowing this job like their own hands. Why? Because they have confidence that they can do anything if they fight for it. Nobody was born with the intelligent to get something form the beginning. When you are learning to walk for the first time, you fall and fall until your knees get red and even end up with blood but after all that effort comes the realize that now you don't depend on them to get something because now you can do it by your own. Believing in yourself is feeling confident. However I still believe that confident have to come before the achievement because confident is courage that every person put itself into his or her heart to full-fill the fear.

As previously stated, things cannot be achieve if there is no confident on it. People need self-esteem in order to function at work and keep learning, the confident and positively that is in every person will make possible for them to get things done, and confident is a feeling of courage that makes the fear goes away. My solution is to have confident in yourself. Make the confident to cover your fear and be sure what you are doing. If something is achieved then the fear will go away and the confident will stay forever. Hope you enjoy this and it will be helpful for your day. Thank you!!",4.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5

If u be honest with one and each other they would be honest with you and you guys will have better friendship with each other. it's good to be honest with your parents because if your in trouble they can help you solve the help if something is happening in school. If your not honest with people they won't trust you ever again they will think that you are a person that lies. I you think about it if you did something bad and don't be honest you will get cought for what you did and it would go how you want it to so it batter if you be honest and truthful but things because if your not it wont go your way. But sometimes being honest with people hurts and some people don't want to hurt them but you just have to because if you don't they will get there hopes up and when your honest with them there going to say thank you and that's when they are going to think to them self and say this is what i should of done from the bringing and this the people i want in my life. So some time you just got to be honest with them and they want you in there if it's okay because at lest they were being honest with and you just move on in life. Honesty is good sometimes i agree but then disagree at the sometime so base I'm trying to say that honest it's good sometimes and sometimes it's not but I rather have honest people in my life because they are telling me the truth and they didn't tell me the truth later on I would get hurt by them and I hate getting hurt by people so I rather them telling me the truth right there when i'm talking to them then founding out by other people and getting hurt and for them not being honest with you from the bringing and putting your self down after you find out. I just feel that honest it's just a good thing because it peras for the real life when you get older and have a job and a family because then your ready for all of what is going to come to you in life sometimes life is not fair to other people and you just got to be ready for it in life.,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
88816FFD8A5C,"Online Learning

Who doesn't want to be left in the house all day using an electronic device with online access? Although students save money and time by taking classes from home. It is not beneficial to learn online because students lose focus of what they are learning and tend to easily get distracted when they're in their house, students can't have a one on one conversation with a teacher nor discuss with classmates, and students could also face technical difficulties when attending online classes from home.

Losing focus has a big impact in learning. For example, my friend Generic_Name sent me a text message last month, right when I started studying for my history mid-term exam. I responded back to Generic_Name's text, and without realizing we kept on messaging past midnight. This shows how easily students get distracted at home with a cellular device and how easy it is to lose focus. The next morning I decided to get to school an hour early and review one on one with my teacher.

Secondly, taking classes online doesn't just mean you don't have a physical teacher or instructor that you can question lively, but also means that it will be challenging to find answers to your questions. I remember in my sophomore year a kid in our econ class named Generic_Name was really sick for a while so he had ended up taking classes online. Generic_Name was a straight A student, always was first to answer the teachers questions and he also used to ask questions. Thankfully Generic_Name healed towards the end of the year and I asked him if he benefited and if he recommends attending classes from home. The straight A student Generic_Name said it was a real challenge to take the class online and he finished the class a month after he should have with a B- average. Generic_Name had also said that one of the most difficult parts about attending a class online was his laptop not functioning at all times, and not having a teacher you can talk and converse with one on one.

Finally, using your personal computer and internet connection can always be an issue. You can't always depend on your computer, not just the computers but even people aren't perfect. Another main problem Generic_Name had when attending classes online was his laptop and network connection. Generic_Name explained that he always faced technical difficulties. When his laptop wasn't functioning right, the only thing he could do was to stop the lesson and wait for his dad to get the laptop repaired, which took time. Each month, either his laptop or internet connection would not cooperate, so he finished the class a month later than everyone.

In conclusion, Everyone would like to save money and time by taking classes from home. But getting distracted, not asking your teacher questions when you need to, and wasting money on laptop repair is not worth it at all. Learning from a far distance could also be an option but when asking if it is beneficial, we can say that it is not by looking at the listed reasoning.    ",4.0,5.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,5.0

When he went to school the next day , he told his friend what his parent told him. Generic_Name friend also knew that being a nurse would not help Generic_Name so he decided to tell him the truth.``Generic_Name maybe your parents are right."", He said.`` Isn't nurse a good job too?,"" Generic_Name asked.``It is , It's just that being a nurse is no good for you and your parents,"" He said.``Why,"" Asked Generic_Name .``Because it doesn't have enough money for you and your parents,"" He said. When Generic_Name went home ,he started thinking maybe his friend was right . He took a lot of time thinking about it. So he decided to be a soldier. At first he didn't want a soldier then he thought about it and he decided to go to soldier school. When he was graduated he went to collage. He worked really hard. When he finished his school,he employed for the soldier work. The first thing they did they buy a new house for him. When he started to work there he didn't have any problems .He felt like his dreams came true. He never had any money problems. And he also had enough money to help his parent. His parent were really proud of their son and happy for him. From there on he didn't have any money problems .

In addition

The one type of job I would employ would be a soldier because

I want to protect people in the country.

Once there was a girl named Generic_Name .Generic_Name lived with his father and mother but she didn't have any siblings. Generic_Name

Generic_Name 's father was a soldier .Generic_Name really loved being a soldier but her parent didn't let her be because in their country girls weren't allowed to fight on wars. One day a soldier came to Generic_Name 's home and told Generic_Name's father that there was war in their town so they needed him. But Generic_Name father couldn't go because he was really sick .And the problem was he only had one child and she was girl. Generic_Name's father wanted to go but Generic_Name stopped him because he was very sick and she didn't want her father to die and she also didn't want their town to be destroyed Generic_Name decided to go to fight by her self . When she was on her way to the soldiers she decided to pretend to be a boy because she knew that if she shows her self as a girl the general will send her back to her father's house .When she got there Generic_Name trained for the war ,she was so ready to fight. The general told them to get ready for the war so that when the enemies comes they start to shoot them first. But the other group planned a really bad way to finish them so when they got there they were all shoot by the enemies except for Generic_Name .She fought all the enemies and they were all died. but when she finished she was so tired so she felt down and slept. when she was asleep the fake hair dropped .When the soldiers came they were so happy but when they saw her they were surprise.``A girl she's a girl,"" one of the soldiers said. When the general came he was so angry that wanted to give the other soldiers permition to kill her but he remembered that she helped them won the the first war so he decided to let her go home and never come back. One day the enemies surrounded the soldiers and they were all attacked. The news was all over the place .The villagers were so afraid because they didn't have any one to protect them .Generic_Name din't want their general to die so she planned something .She went to the enemies secretly .She killed all of their enemies and then she went to their captain . ``Your highness I know the person who wanted to kill you,"" she said. ``He said that he is not afraid of you and he is waiting for you your highness,"" she said. ``Do you you know where that person is now?,"" Asked the captain. ``Yes and he said he's waiting for you ,""She said. ``Take me there,"" Said the captain.``OK ,"" She said. So she took the general out side. But when the general got there he didn't saw any body. ``Where is the person?,"" the general asked.``I am the person,"" Generic_Name said. At first the general laugh and laugh but when they started fighting .The general died and the people didn't have any problems. And from that day on Generic_Name was accepted to be a soldier and everybody respected her .

One job that i would like to work to would be a soldier because i want to get a lot of money and I also want to help the citizen just like Generic_Name did. At first Generic_Name thought that being a nurse was the right thing for him but when he stepped to soldier he didn't have any problems about money and his poor family now lives good life because of their child is a soldier. At first the general though that girls can not help on the war but Generic_Name wanted to prove it and she proved that women too are strong enough to be soldiers.

Dear

Manager I would like to employ for soldier because it is a good way to protect other people and it has a lot of money. Some people think that only men can work on soldier work but if you believe that you're wrong because soldier work is for all of us not only for men. If you're a woman and you want to be a soldier just do it it doesn't matter what type of a person you are.",2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.5
895FFC078777,"More is always done when we do what we need to do, other wise we get lazy and say ""I'll do it tommorow"". We never know if tommorow will ever come for us to do the tasks that could be important. It's good to have a mindset where you like to get stuff done, that shows that youre an honest person, and it can really say alot about a person. When we dont do anything get stressed out, and worry about it to much, more then we're suppose to. Doing nothing is easier then doing something, but doing nothing has a bigger consequence then doing something. Around the world, there are people that accomplished alot, always by doing something, and not by doing nothing. There are Entrepreneurs around the world that didnt wait to do something with themselves. For example, Bill Gates, he is the richest man in the world with billions of dollars to his name,but how did he manage to get all that money? by doing something and not by doing nothing, doing what he needed to do, when it needed to be done, not waiting for tommorowto do the tacks that he needed to do to get where he is today. Bill Gates was always busy doing something to get stuff done for a company, now he's the owner for Microsoft. Doing something will always bring positivity around you, into your life, another example is Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs didnt wait to do something for himslef, he dropped out of college, but it didn't stop him from doing what he wanted to after that. He stayed in a small garge, worked day and night to invent a computer, the MacBook, with this computer, he was going to become a famous Entrepreneur. A couple of years later Apple came to be to what it is today, Steve Jobs worked hard to get his company to where is today, by working hard and not by doing nothing, but by always doing something. Steve Jobs is a great example of how much great can come by doing some. These two Entremreneurs are great examples of doing something, great should come. They both worked so hard for their companys, not waiting a day for something to be complete. Doing nothing will not get anyhting done, neither will waiting. So we have to get stuff done so we won't have to worry or stress about it later. to conclude my essay, we should always do something the moment we get the task, other wise it will never be done.",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5

We would like to be a famous doctors as well as you are. We are also so excited to meet your workplace because some people doesn't have the opportunity to visit you and your clinic. We choose this job because we think it is a great job and also because you can save lives.

It will be a pleasure to meet your workplace. We want to be like you, be a famous person. We also would like to know a little bit more about how to be a fantastic doctor. We choose your workplace because of people told us that your clinic is the most amazing place to have an operation. We are five students that would like to know more about how to be a doctor and how to safe lives. I was thinking about if maybe you may be with us. We are asking if you can allow us to be in a operation with you ,or be watching how do you and the other doctors work in the clinic. We would like to be a great surgeons.

We think that your workplace will be a great starting to know more about how to do an operation. We would like to know how to become a doctor. Your clinic is always clean. We are asking if you can give us the approbation to visit your hospital. It will be a pleasure to meet you and your hospital because we just want to know how do you work, how do you control the clinic, how do you make an operation. We would like to be in an intensive room, even if it can be disturbing. We also choose this kind of job because it is great, even is sometimes doctors have to make hard decisions.

We know a little bit about medicine. We would like to be in your clinic one day because we want someone to show us the materials that the doctors use. In the school we do not have the resources to have these materials. We are actually studying to be the most knowing doctors becausewe want to be different from the others. You are the person who inspires us to be doctors. My dream is that in a future I can have my own clinic and hospital. Be able to say, "" I did it"". I know that it is a hard dream to follow. But if you gives us the chance to be in your hospital for one day. My dream will finally come true.

I swear that my life will be better if you let us be in there. Maybe you had a dream too, and I suppose that it was not easy to became a professional doctor. Was it? So can you please make my dream true and give me the first steep to be a professional person. I know is kind of hard to ask you to let us be in your clinic because I know you are a busy person. But I just want to know a little bit about medicine. I know you are a great surgeon, that is the why I am asking you to teach me. I know that it is not easy to be the hospital's manager and surgeon but there if you can. I'll too.

8C880B194034,"Thomas Jefferson said. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Forthermar, not all the people agree with this stament. Of coure, those two persons have different ideas. Forthermar, many people like to be leasy and they do not try to move on; Since, Other wants to move and work hard to make more opportunity. I agree with this stament, because this represent three nice pace to make others opportunity struggle, exploit, and related.

However noeveryone agree. To begin, some of people think they can't make more option that they all ready have for some reasons. For intance, alots of people have not easy life some of they are not reach they do not have money to make more option. But, we has to know something that's true about this life that's nathing is going to be easy to make or do. For intance, one day before granfather deid he tell my a story how they were before his life. His life it was really hard before, they was not a family reach his five childreans only ate one time on some days. But he always said this words ""one day everything is going to change."" He never stop to belived that. After this terrible day he find other opportunities to make a different life for his family. Is why everyday I think careful, if you wants something ""I need to struggle.""

Moreover, we can accomplish wonderful dreams, if we exploit the time. For intance, People can make many dreams so fast, also thing you never belived to get one day like a beautiful car, a big house, and other beutiful things. But you can get all this if you work hard and. In addition others people can give different life, because you have how to help othres. All the person who never stop work that person always make so many things

Finally, be related everyday this is something special. Because you always are looking for something more than one. That means you not stop in one street you always are try to gross the other way. For intance, one day I was thinking how to make my dream fast and how to get it. An I said If we are people who like to find different option we are going to get it. And that is all this is a reflection to know how you can get everything in your life, but you has to know this if you never go in from nathing is going to happen.

In short, the ideas is to tell you how many opportunities or dreams you can make, if you move to one side to the other sides. For example people who not try to move more far away they never is going to make something different, and that so sad because you never are going to know how many special dreams you can had, but that is going to happen if you don't move to the other side, but if you work hard and you always look for more you always are going to have everything in your life. For intance, you want a car and the car the cost is one million you will buy that car why, because you work hard and you have the money so you will have the money for buy this types of cars. Struggle and you will have everything you want, exploit go outside and find others opportunities not lose you time the time run very fast everyday, you are going to cry one day may be because you was leasy and that is going to be sad for you, the last try to be related because there is the way you are going to find many option for make you life different. If you do all this your life is going to be easy for live.  ",3.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5
8D160B0BC04B,"I agree with Author Emerson because people can do what they think makes them happy, they will support what they believe in without fearing anything, and they will speak up for themselves. Emerson's quote is saying that we live in a world with many influences trying to change who you are , so to retain your individuality or who you are is a great magnanimous feature. Most people end up striving to change themselves to fit standards to portrayed by media or to try to impress someone, however I think that people who choose not to change, and to be themselves are the accomplished ones. Other people will be inspired to become like you if you exceed to be yourself and not care what others think of you , and you should do what makes you comfortable. By you going against what everyone thinks is normal , you are showing that you are happy about who you are and you will stand out , out of all the other people trying to be someone they are not.

8DCC1AC9A8EA,"World is change every second. Each year grow tree. But people cut trees faster.

Some people says to be succesful in our life person need be yourself. But, why?

Be yourself is the best way to be succesful.

But most of people don't know, how be succesful? They think that to have money they will be succesful. For example, peoples try be IT programers, because someone say that they earn more money. But most people don't know, what it is and in this area most people are new. Their don't want work and their work are looks not good. After a couple time, they left this job and they trying somthing else. Only couple of them stay on this area. Another example is students. This year some students will be grated, and they don't come back to school again. Nobody don't ask ""Does student want go to school?"". And this is one of the reason, why students don't want go to school. But, those years that he was in school, he will be remind.

Most people don't know, what will be after four years. Students go to college which say their parents.

Most of us to survive in this life doing that he or she don't want. Most imigrants come to rich countries because they have money. They learn their native language just to have more money.

One person say ""Make your job what you want to do and you wouldn't work, never"". We don't think how we can be succesful? And it's make wrong desision. People think that be painter or artist is bad, because they don't have much more money. This mind is wrong. Artists are be not bad because they live by yourself.

To find yourself is hard because it take time and other people influens to other people. But when person find yourself his or her life will be happy.

8DF5D7CF4085,"Everywhere you go, everyone or at least someone makes a plan for their future reference or goal. Many people don't have the time to accomplish their goal and others have. Everyone has a way to achieve or succeed in something they like. Others like to stay idle or not tend to move to achieve their goal. And other people like to do something to accomplish their goal. Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle....it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I totally agree to Thomas Jefferson's statement that, we accomplish more if we are doing something.

To start with, doing something can help you plan, achieve, or complete your future goal quicker.

For example, When you are given a task to complete you can't sit there idle to wait for someone to help you or wait for a magic to happen to complete your goal. If you want to graduate from high school and get to college with a scholarship, you will have to study hard to get to college. If you want to get a great permanent job, you still have to study hard and have a good resume. This will make you be faster with every work you be given to complete.

Furthermore, doing something always makes you more active. For instance, when you fail an exam or possibly one or too many of them, you can't possibly say that you do not care about your score, you have to take action, study hard, and hope for the next exams you would make it to the top. Whenever I fail a text, even though I don't like to retake a text, I prepare for the next text we are going to have for the next unit and for all the rest unit we are going to learn. I like to learn ahead of the class because am not really smart to learn in class so instead I learn and prepare ahead in class. Planning and taking notes in class or anywhere else can make you tend to do something than to sit there idle to plan your future. Making plans for the future helps you achieve or accomplish your goal.

On the other hand, many people often argue that staying idle to achieve your goal will make you less stressful. They say that because people want to achieve their goal by doing something, they often take pills that will make them stay awake especially for the high schoolers'. They say this because most high schoolers' wants to achieve more, graduate and get a better college and a great permanent job so they put all their might into studying and drinking and taking pills to stay awake and some student often get sick but can't stop cause they have been addicted to it. Although this may be valid, but doing something always makes you great and achieve your future goals and helps you to be more responsible in the future because in the future it will be easy for you to get a job and mostly half of every job will ask whether you have an experience or you being qualified for the job. And you probably don't know what's going to happen in the future so you to be prepared and planned for the future.

In a nutshell, I like to plan my future goals and learn ahead of my class. Completing an action all the time will forever make you involve in important duties. It also helps you discover more. It can also help you improve in your studies and make you a successful person in the future. It will make you useful in your workplace. Many teachers and other colleagues will admire and respect you and you can even turn out to be their model. You can get the college you have been always dreaming of and accomplish all your personal goals. ",4.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0

"" To be in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" This a quote that Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote. People may agree or disagree everyone has there own opinion. I however agree with his quote because, if your being yourself you'll feel relieved not pretending to be something or someone you aren't. Sometimes pretending to be someone or something you aren't can stress you out because you feel pressured. You feel like you need everyone to like you but will you feel good about yourself pretending.

Ralph Waldo Emerson, the author who wrote "" To be in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" Why do most people agree with his quote, there could be many reasons. My reason to agree with Ralph's quote is because people can see the real you when being yourself. Not being yourself around your family, friends, and other people could make you feel less confident about yourself or your actions. Pretending can make you feel guilty, it could make you feel like you're lying to someone about yourself, so think about it.

The author Ralph waldo Emerson once wrote "" To be in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" As I said many people agree and many disagree we are all entitled to our own opinions. If you ask me I completely agree with his quote because, one you don't have to worry what others think of you, two you feel relieved not pretending to be someone or somethings you aren't, and three people can see the real you.

that's why limitation of humans contact to the use of technology has positive efects. For example some people destoiyerd their eyes because of using to mach technology.

Third,what inforamtion can give us technology in our entire life. technology is the biggest things which is we need in our life to do,technology is not the only using phones, computer, robots.. technology can change our life without technology we can not contact the world with humans and information about world.

In conclusion, i have to sat that has humans limitation of contact to use technology because has positive efects. We have take care our healt and body to save from dengeours happening with technology. In additaion, techonloy has alot information which is we need for now, past and for our future. Finally, in my opnion technology can help us alot in our whole life but, also can destioyrd our life. Every one knows that without technology life is hard but, if we have to save our health aslo. With technology our life giong to easy also can hurt oue life.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5
907FC59841EC,"I disagree to school board adding an half hours to school each day. I think is bad because adding another half hour to takes time away from there family and it takes to be with there family.

some children do not have time to see their family in the week days because there mom or dad comes home after they are going to sleep or before they go to school but maybe Fridays to Sundays is when they can see their family. Some students don't have time to say a few hours because some students have sports to do or they are going do something else at home or have to go see the doctor.

If they add a half hour to the school system I think all most all of the student will not come to school half of the school year. I disagree to the school board adding a half hour to school each day. I been to school all year except when I have to go the doctor for cheek up that is the only time I miss school. I play sports so I do not have time say a little bet longer of school or I am not on the term anymore.

To sum up I think school should be the some as it is or take sum time of school because is too long to add time to it. All in all school help as to learn.",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5

Dear principle,

Community service should be a job, not for students to perform. Requiring students to do that job is very difficult, especially during school days. Community service should be a job that the government should be giving to people who don't have jobs. Students should have their time in school and after school to learn and enjoy part of their life. Example, that of a person who comes back from school, tired and with a lot of homework to do. If he goes to do that service, he might not do all of his homework. And if he stays late to night to do it, he will not focus the next day. So that will hurt the student from both ways. As my position was stated to you to read, my advice to you is; at least help some students get our of this difficult service. And if the community needs some help as stated; take them in a specific day during school. But if it's everyday, community service jobs should be announced. That way students have some time and also learn community service during school.

When you were a kid you had imagination it was with you when you were born, knowledge you have to learn. With imagination you can believe anything, new ideas are made with imagination, imagination is fun.

You can believe anything you want with imagination. What is imagination? Its something you imagine for example an imaginary friend. Something not real but you see it no one else can see your imagination. You can make your brain think whatever you want you control it. You want to believe your touching a teddy bear, than you just imagine it and feel it. Our imagination is in our brains with us it's something you're born with something only you can see it, feel it, and only you can imagine it.

Ideas happen because of imagination you can think of new ideas for a movie or anything. Some people just have a bigger imagination then us but we all think unique. Everything we have in earth is because imagination happened. Those people think ""what do we need, what can help me."" First you gotta imagine it, then you have to believe, and finally you do it.

Imagination is fun just let it take you where ever you want. its something you're born with not something you learn. Take vantage of it.

That's why i think Imagination is more important then knowledge. You have it with you, you just need to let it shine. Just image anything. Don't be afraid to show your imagination. Just do it and keep imaging, you imagination can take you anywhere you want.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5
9145AB74E1DA,"I don't think it's a good idea to work from home they're a lot of kids that would just take advantage from working from home. Kids would rather be at home then have to go to school at seven in the morning. They're different kinds of people out there who would stay at home just because they didn't feel like getting up so early in the morning. Other kinds where kids put effort into going to school. I don't think working from home is a good idea for school students.

There are some kids that can't really work at school, but then they're others that just do it for fun. By saying how kids take advantage is because some of them would do their ""school work"" from home but it would end up with them just sleeping and doing their work later. School may be difficult but that's why we have teacher to help you the staff and your parents they will always be there to help. Even the classes online that you do if you work from home have people to help you if you have any questions or if you just need help. Some people are visual learners like right infront of you that's is why i think kids shouldn't work from their homes. People are different some work better by themselves others work better in a group or with a partner that's is why working in school is the better idea.

I'm not saying saying it wouldn't benefit the kids who are doing their work online i'm just saying working in school is easier. I'm saying some students wouldn't benefit from working from home they would just sleep instead of work or they would just goof off instead of work. They're a lot of reasons is to why I don't think working from home or working online is a good idea. You never know who your going to meet online. Some kids don't have internet access so they wouldn't be to work online and when your at school you have all kinds of resources to help you.

My opinion in this is that working at school is better than working at home kids actually have a chance to get stuff done and at home kids would just sleep and not do their school work because well, they're at home. Learning at school is way more helpful then learning online you always have someone there to help. Yes their will be some kids that will learn online and there won't be some people do work better with the person right in front of them.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
9152EA0F430B,"This world have many energy and resources, but we have to something to conserve all of them. Some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, to try to conserve energy and resources, but they work ten hours each day that's mean that they still doing the same thing because they are working the same hours weekly. So I think this is not a good idea to conserve energy and resources, should my school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? I would say that my school should not follow this model because students would not have time to do things, students might miss a lot school, and is the same thing is like we come the five days to school.

We would not have time to our things because is going to be a long day two hours more, so we are going to be tired we might not want to do our homework. Somethings we have to do our personals things like help at home, or some other stuff that we need to do such as have fun with our family, or do what we like to do as play soccer, play video games, etc. I know that school is more important, but not the majority of the students thing like that. We would have to do all the things over the weekend, we might not spend time with our family because we would been doing homework, or some other stuff like personal things. Also some students only would go home to sleep because like I say we would be tired to much work at school. Even the teachers would not have time to plan what would be the assignment the next day, I know that they need time to plan in what we have to work on the next day, but they have to do things in their house as we the students too they also have homework to do after school. This is going to one problem that I think must happen if this school extend the school day two hours more.

We might miss a lot day of school because somethings we have appointments as go to the Doctor, or go to somewhere else also do some important things. some students might decide to not come to school because they have to go the appointment. As we know some students miss a lot school on this day if school extend the day they might miss more day of school because they might say that is too long the day, or if they have a project to do and is a big project (we get out until 5:00PM), so we have to finish in whole night supposing we finish the project until 3:00AM, in the morning we not going to wake up because we are tired, we would miss the day of the school also we would not turn it in the project (It was the only day that we would have to turn it in), so we didn't get the grade for the project. Also teachers would have problem with their children for example if they have their children in a day care id they only work until 5:00PM they have to run to get they children, but if there is traffic, so they would be late. They might have to paid extra money to someone can pick up their children. Even when we come for the five-days per eight hours we have more time to do our thing that we have to do after school.

Some people might say that they support to come to school to a four day school week and extend the day two hours because we would have three free days. However, is going to be the same if we come the five days per eight hours because we would come ten hours per day, so ten per four is equal to forty hours for day (this is if we come four-day a week), so eight per five is equal to forty hours (this is if we come the five days per eight hours). We would still using the energy and resources at the same amount as we use to do it now, as we see is the same thing if we come to school the five days per eight hour. We need something that help us to conserve energy and resources not something that would give the same amount the we are using now.

Finally, I think this is not a good idea to conserve energy and resources because we would use the same amount that we're using right now. My school should not follow this model because they have to think that consequences like people would miss a lot of school they might be tired too much work in one day of school to long one day, we would not have time to do our things at home like homework, personal things, and we would not have time to have fun by doing what we like to do as play soccer, or other stuff, and is going to be the same thing if we come to school the five days per eight hours. We have more time to do our homework, to do what we like to do like have fun, and spend time with our family when we come the five days per eight hours. If we really want to conserve energy and resources we have to find something that is going to be successful, not something that would give us the same result.          ",2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5

Generic_Name woke up every day early in the morning and he went at the college, after he took a bus for his job. After all his effort, after all the nights that he could not sleep, he became in a lawyer but Generic_Name never imagine that the real challenge is coming. After two years of his graduation he found a job ,he bought a house and a car and that is all Generic_Name did for the rest of his life. Should we aspire just at one thing? In every single aspect of our life we have aspiration, to be more every day to get the most beautiful house, the better job but that is all when we get all the we want and the set we stop there. In my opinion,if we don't try to do something beyond what we have already mastered,we'll never grow because we'll never have the enough experience and a better quality of life.

First,we'll never the enough experience because we always being in the same situation, every experience that we have make our knowledge,the way that we see the life and the problems. If we never give up to do something beyond our spirit preserve young while we have more experience we'll have more opportunities nos just in a professional aspect . For example,if we go to college and we finish the career but we stop there for the simple reason it is more safe so we never grow because that make us to be stagnate in one place,we think that doesn't matter that we good.

Second,We'll have a better quality of life because when we try to do the best every day,when we kept learning we became in a successful person which is good point because you inspire at others. we'll have all the thing that one day we wanted an the most important thing we'll have the power to help other. For example,when we continue learning more and more we'll stay one step more near of our challenge and we need continue to the same way.

In summarize,I'm agree with Emerson's statement because we always need to be more that we were yesterday. The success,the opportunities,better condition of life and the happiness is part of never stop grow.

The first reason is that we as a human being, we need help. When we are working, we need help from others at work, during class at school, anywhere where we work. For example, at work when I'm cooking I also need someone that can brings the ingredients. Some would argue that, working in group don't help you to learn, but we learn from others not from ourselves. As a result, we obtain help from others working as a group. Additionally, we obtain benefits working in groups. In addition, benefits to us are made it from others, benefits to others are made it from us. To illustrate, when I'm sick, and I can't go to work I need someone to change his scheduled, and take my place, for that day, so he is going to need the same benefit from me to cover him one day he get be sick, or will have any emergency. Some may say that working in group is not beneficial, working in a group we acquired more benefits than working alone. As a result working in groups give us the chance to have more benefits.

It's obvious that, working is groups is more beneficial this will allow us to get the help need it from others, and to have more benefits made it by others. We should always work in groups, helping each other as a human being.",4.0,3.0,3.5,2.0,3.0,3.0

People do anything on phones, but it has negative things to using them a lot: dating people through text, and less communication in real life and more over text. While most people believe that technology has positive effects in reality, it is mostly a negative effect.

Technology is not a good thing in certain situations. It is better to get to know people in person rather than social media or anything. No one knows who someone is until they meet them in person because some people lie to make someone like them. Technology can hurt people in different ways: physical, emotional, or any other way. People tend to do things to hurt the other person online rather than to their faces.

Some people decide to date someone through social media when it isn't a good idea to do. People can fake identities to make people think they're another person. people decide to not say who they really are, so they could either kidnap them or make the person they're tricking to send them money if they live in another country. It's rare that people find someone who doesn't lie about who they are. Some people probably decide to date through social media because they think that they won't find anyone who will really like them.

Most people who have technology now use them to communicate with other people instead of in person. Most people decide to communicate through online or text so that they don't see the person's face. People feel more brave to tell a person something mean or hurtful through text or anything. People just decide to not talk, but instead to text.

Some people believe that students should be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class. But should students be forcibly required to take a music,a drama, or an art class?

Students should not be require to take a music or art classes, and make these classes as a electives.

Dont limit they're choice

If school start to limiting classes and require to take certain classes, this is truly ineffective for everyone.

All students have rights to pick what they're interested in, and what they need. For example, If they're applying colleges and they need some specific classes and credits ,they might want to take what they're needed other than art and music class because its simply waste of time.

It's unpopular, unnecessary, and unprofitable for some students.

Not every students are artistic person and want to take a music or art class. Maybe art or music is not they're area ,according to newspaper ""CNN"" 's participation experiment graph, it compared to people who are interested and those who are not, and graph showed people who are not interested seems to loosing they're focus and even irritating them.

It's waste of time if they're not into it, they will eventually end up loosing interest.

There is no point of waste our precious time by doing things that we are not into it, obviously it's always privilege to take academic classes in school ,but it's not always the case. we rather do something else that are more fun and more productive for us.

It is mortal for some students especially seniors.

If school is limiting and make require to take academic classes it is mortal for some students especially seniors, those who failed one or two classes and need to make up. But because of school is limiting and make require to take academic class they couldnt graduate on time.

I strongly believe that students should not be require to take a music or art classes, and make these classes as a electives. If school make art and music and other academic classes as a elective, it will be more effective for everyone, because every students will have choice to pick what they really want or need.

Family members and teachers expect students to know what career they want when they enter high school, so it can help them choose the classes they need. I think students should have time to choose what they want to major in.

One reason I think students should have time to think what they want to major in is; they can get tired of the career they chose or change their mind of what career to take. For example, my friend Generic_Name is in AFROTC, she has been in AFROTC for 3 years. In her Junior she decided she wanted to leave AFROTC to do something else, she wanted to do nails instead. If Generic_Name can leave AFROTC her scheduled for the next school year can change. She will have to learn how to do nails and learn the more, difficult, ways to do them as well. For this reason it will be good for students to take their time and find out what they really want to take. They have all of high school year to think about it before they entering college.

Another reason students should think about what they want to major in is, they don't know what career to take or they could have many options but can not chose one. One career could be too difficult or one could be fun but not earn has much. Students should look over the careers they want and see if it is right for them. For example, I have 3 careers I'm thinking about but can not choose one. I have 1 year to think about which one. For me photography would be the one for me as I like to take pictures of the most beautiful places in my home town. I would also like to see other parts of world, see beautiful people who live there, work with amazing people, and see what I can take a picture of. i also want to the world to know what is going on fromw the different parts of the world and not the news. i want people to see it not hear.

Some students already know what career they want to take. Most of the students are thinking which one will be good for them, and which suits them the best. It is good for students to know what career they want, but it is also good for them to think it over or think it through. As students already know what they want to do and go straight to college. Some students like to take a break and not go to college right after they leave high school. These students are taking a break to figure out what career to take, what college to go to, and save money to be able to go to college. This can help the students in many ways. In one way if the student does not like their major and think its too hard it will change major. The student will keep changing major until it finds the right for him/her. By taking a break the student can think if he/she really likes the career they have chosen.

For all of these reasons I do think it Will be good for the students to take their time on choosing a career. They don't have to have a hard time choosing one or changing the career for another one. If they don't have an idea of what career they have a lot of time. They can take a break and think very well about their options. It can help them from not changing majors when they are in college. Students taking their time for choosing careers is good for them and will help them choose the right career for them.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5
983D4402B74F,"Not everyone in the world is able to accomplish their dream. There are so many obstacles that make a dream impossible and a lot of important things to give up in order to reach it. The British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" I agree with Winston Churchill because I also believe that failure, hope, and enthusiasm are the three keys to success in life.

First, all the things have two sides. the bad side and the good one, not everyone can see this two sides because of two simple reason. The first reason is because they do not try hard enough to find a solution. The second reason is because they loss their hope. Failure has two side but they are hard to see. The bad side of failure is that you did not reach that goal in your first or second try and you give up everything. The good side is that you fail but you learn a little bit on the way and that the next time you will be more close to reach that lovely goal.

Second, some things that i have learn from family, friends, and own experiences is that hope is the most powerful thing in the world. Most people tempt to lose their hope when they fail, while for others that maintain it can be more able to success. When I try something and I fail I always ask a question to my self. The question is What would I be without hope? When i answer that question I feel that all my strength and enthusiasm that I need for reaching that dream come to me.

Lastly,

a person can not reach a goal without been enthusiast. No one in the world would fight for something that is not interested on. Enthusiasm is what give you the strength and hope to keep trying until you success. Enthusiasm can also be lose by a person when they fail so many times. The thing that make people lose their enthusiasm is the time.

In conclusion, in order to be a successful person in life you need to make sure not to lose the three keys. Failure, that help you to gain experience, hope that help you to not give up, and enthusiasm that help you to keep trying. This are the three keys. Next time that you fail just thing about this three keys and you will be able to success in your life.",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,4.0

After that i went to chipotle restaruant just for fun to prove if my friend was right and he was, the people from chipotle didn't look at me in a strange way as the first time, i think it's because they didn't remember me but when the manager comes he said, ""hoo hellow you're back,"" then he leave.

The manager was the only person who remembers me and he did not change his opinion about me, i didn't care because by that time i did get the job at popeyes so i decide to leave out of there.

The closest school near my grandpa was 3.4miles away he had to go walking, but he went to anyway school he cared about his learning and he found it fun. It was a big deal to go to school where my grandpa lived or lived near by not many people get even get to go school at all it was that special.

99A73BEA826C,"Students Need to Identify a Career

I am in 11th grade and I still thinking in what career should be better for me, if I could expected a career by the time I entered to High School, I could not being worry about what career should be better for me. I think that is a good idea that students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school, because in the four years that they are in high school they can get prepare in the career they want. By the time the students enter to college it will be much easier for them because they have already decided what career should be better for them.

There are four year in high school, students can use those years to star to learn a little bit in the career they chose. For example, I had one friend that he wanted to be a scientist, so when he was in high school he get prepared to a scientist, he started to look what he need be a scientist, he looked how many years he had to go to college, he found that science has a lot of math problems that he did not know and he started to learn math. The four years in high school can help you to get prepare in your the career you want.

Another reason why students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school is that when go to college it will be much easier for them. If the students identify a career by that time, in college they can only focus in the career they chose. There are many students that go to college and they have not already decided what career should be better for them, and in many cases there are students that are out of college and still thinking what to do with their life. That's why it is important for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school or at least when they are still in high school.

In my opinion it's good idea that students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school, because if they could identify a career that they might think they would like, that could be a lot of helpful, because by the time they go to college they don't get stress because they don't have much time to decide what career could be better for them.

Ralph has a very good point : Lazy, shy, scared people wont succeed or grow as a person or in the work force.

Doing more than what your good at helps grow your confidence, and your way of doing things for the better. Doing more could possibly give you a little higher pay raise or be a boss at a at a big company.

Doing more than what your already good at can go a long way for you.

You should start doing better right now because it will benefit you in so many ways.

Not doing more than you can already do can possibly give you bad rep. Or some people will see you as a lazy person in life. Because that person is not pushing him or her self to do more or the beyond because that person isnt motivated to do anything more that their good at. That person wont succeed as much as the person that is doing more or the beyond.

One time when i was a small Child. My Uncle always talked to me about a lot of stuff.

The most important thing he told me is to do more than what i can already do. Because it will take me places and it will make my life a lot better. He said if you do more. I will succeed more in life. When i got older he talked to me more about it. Because he knew i was gonna do more in life. Now i work as hard and beyond than the other person. And make more money because i work more than i already mastered.

I think working beyond than your comfort zone will help a lot. You can be really successful if you challenge yourself in life. It could be school or work. It doesnt hurt if you challenge your self. You will succeed as much than the other guy.         ",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0

A other reason would be is that many students don't do their homework nowdays so it was just be a waste time for the teachers unless they are getting paid extra for staying after school now thats a differnt story. A other reason is what if none of the students stayed after school the school would have to be sure if students would a tend this homework club. Students should be able to do thier homework on there own to be honest so that way they learn more cause maybe the teacher might be giving the students the answers and that's just not right! My other reason why they shouldn't do the homework club is what if most teachers don't give out homework like i don't get a lot of homework but maybe somone else wouldn't get homework. Would any teachers parpicate in the homework club, do they know that teachers would argee on doing this club?

Thomas Jefferson wrote; of how ""wonderful much may be done if we are always on it nonstop.""

Will I believe, that inactivity always serve a purpose because in order to finish what your doing, you have to take breaks between them and your body won't shut down while your doing it. Although, some people may say we accomplish more if we are on it all the time.

Inactivity always serve a purpose because in order to finish what your doing, you have to take breaks between them. To begin with, that's why now in days we have Saturdays and Sundays off. For example, our bodies wouldn't be able to function without any stopping point. Next, we're not even going to be able to sleep with all that pressure building up on us. Lastly, even animals take rest after along day of hard work to continue on moving.

Inactivity always serve a purpose, because your body won't shut down while your doing it. For starters, we can be working, but we might be falling asleep at the same time anything can happen. However, we might even get hurt doing work hours depending on what your job is. To finish off with, we can lose our lives while driving or cost others.

some may say we accomplish more if we are on it all the time, because we can get more work done and we can finish faster. First, we can learn something faster if we are on it all day nonstop without rest. Second, if we are on just on that we make better results of ourselves doing what we are doing. For example, if we are building an apartment or house you name it. We might just finish faster without a stopping point. It'll just take less time to get there, Just as a journey that takes you wherever you go without stopping. lastly, is great when you don't stop moving forward and accomplish your goals your'll make it.

Inactivity always serve a purpose, because in order to finish what your doing, you have to take breaks between them and your body won't shut down while your doing it. Still, some people may say we accomplish more if we are always doing something. In the end, I believe Is all up to you to determine weather or not to be Idle.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5
9C6132E41DDE,"If I was to explain to my teacher if I prefer to work in groups or work alone, I would pick work alone. Working alone is good because you could think of ideas that some students can't think about. For example,working alone can get you a better high score in the class then working in groups. Another example is when your working in groups it can cause you to not finish the work you started because your either talking or not focused in what your supposed to do. In some cases some students like working alone because they get to turn in there work on time so they don't have to fail the class. Another example, some students are really quiet and they are shy to talk to people so they work alone so they don't need to be behind everyone else who isnt doing there work.

Students often don't really get a lot of help from other students when they work in groups. Often some kids make the mistake on joining groups but then when it comes to doing work only 2 students do the work and then the other 2 don't do anything. Students sometimes don't even do anything they just sit around and talk to there friends about other things then they talk about the work they need get done or there on the phone or playing games. For example some students don't like doing anything they just like to sit around and talk but on the other hand they are students that like doing there work so it's best to see that students like working alone then to be working in groups. In some cases some students don't let them talk to there friends because they think they are gonna make there child fail that class and some parents are gonna blame the friends then there own children. For example if a parent gets a phone call from a teacher saying oh your student is failing my class because there not doing there work like they used to before the parent is gonna feel bad because there gonna think oh my child is hanging out with kids there not supposed to be with. In my opinion I think it's best for students to work alone then to be working in group.

The benefits what you have working in a group. The benefits are you can talk with your group abuth the work and also you can hask cuesthions and you can talk abuth examples and than they can toldyou how they can do the work and the group can suport your ideas.

Working alone do not have to moch benefits. The benefits are you can use ideas of your shelf the other is not one goin to disturb you and you can put your examples but that will be more dificult because you need to find the information and not one goin to suport your ideas.

For example working in a group in high school the english teacher say the students goin to do groups of four. For do a progect the students say yes, one of those students say i will colect the information, the other say i goin to writing the information and the other say i will put the examples of the progect and other say i will reading the progect and also i goin to do a expocition in class is more good because you will stay more relax because the group is help you.

For example working alone in class, the high school teacher say we goin to do groups because we have a progect but if you want work alone you can do it. the student say i like work alone because no one goin to disturb in my work the studen can put ideas of him shelf but you do not have some one to talk abauth the progect. and you will have nebous inclass you will be distracted and boring.

Why some people do not like to work in groups? the people do not like work in groups becase they have problems with the people in the group meybe he do not feel well in the group or he feel some nervous in the group or because some people lika work in silent.

Why the most people like to work in groups? that is because the people like work with friends, he feel well talking with the group, he like answer the cuestions of the group.",3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.5

Eating a healthier meal will reduce the chances of being obitisty. A lack of a bad food would result the chances of not getting enough knowledge,compare to having a healthy meal. The school cafeteria should serve a healthy meal.

Students look forward eating lunch during school,because lunch refuels the mind,and the body with important victims. Lunch is the second important meal of the day,because students look toward a short break during school to refill their body,and mind. Eating a healthy meal in the middle of day will help students pay attention during school. Junk food is bad to serve during lunch, because it won't allow the students to be more active during the day,and pay attention in class. Overall students need a healthy meal to go on with there life during school,and outside school.

Throughout the years the chances of being obesity has increased. One of the main reasons why is because school lunches has served unhealty food. Junk food is unhealthy for the human body,because getting enough food will make you gain weight. Calories are based on what you eat,eating unhealthy will make you gain weight while eating healthy will help you balance out calories. Eating healthy will help reduce the chances of being obesity.

Eating a health meal during school will make the students be productive during school. Biting into an apple is the same thing, as drinking a sip of coffee.

I also have missed my school bus; therefore, I had to walk the whole way to my school. I was tired and tensed. As a result, I couldn't do well in that test, but if I was taking online class, I could take the test from home and be able to not get into all this trouble. Online classes can save us from getting into all this kind of problems and save our time also. Although some say students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because sometimes, students might not understand their lecture or work on online classes, and as a result, they would not be able to do well in that class, actually students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time and by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities.

Those who believe students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home have their reasons.

They say sometimes students might not understand their lecture or work on online classes, and as a result, they would not be able to do well in that class. For example, if they get a project or assignment, some students may have trouble in understanding how to do/complete that assignment or sometimes, they might not understand a topic from a lecture in online class.

However, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time. For example, if I get sick, I don't need to miss school. I can stay at home and take my classes from home. Again, if I'm not at home or may be I'm at my relative's place or my friend's place, I'll be still able to attend those classes.

Also, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities. One example is that, if I don't need to come to school to attend classes I would be able to make my own schedule and I can do my job for more hours in weekdays and save money for my college. Again, I can finish my school works quickly and take other courses which can help me in my future career or, may be I can do some other activities I like.

In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time and by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities.

For example, people's vision might get blurry and people that are looking down at their electronic devices impacts their neck position. Furthermore, people may slouch down when they are using a computer. This is important because people need to be more aware of what can effect their health in a horrible way.

The use of technology is phenomenal, people use it in their every day lives. Therefore, individuals get too dependent on technology; For instance, Individuals use technology to communicate with others and they use it for location. In addition to that, people use technology to educate themselves. Although those are beneficial perks, it causes people to be too dependent on technology. This is important because instead of people completing tasks with technology, they can easily do it themselves. To illustrate, if people want a snack they can walk down to the store and buy it instead of ordering it online

People think that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has positive effects on their lives since people with no available transportation can order online or if others live in a area that is dangerous, they can order online to receive the things that they want to be safe; However, technology has a negative impact since it makes people risk their health.

9E4F43374DD5,"Do you think that school students should have at least participate in one or more extracurricular activity, agree or disagree. I think that students should participate in one or more school extracurricular activity. here are some of my reason on why i think that student should participate in a school activity.

I think that student should participate in a school activity because if you normally have noting do after school but just setting around waiting for something to happen, but if you were in any of the school sports you be wont be bored all the time anymore. school can make you meet new friends or get even better at the sport than you are now. sport can make you keep in good shape and good health.

school clubs are really fun to do because you get to some really big project and activity but it also depends on what clubs you chose. like for example theres the FFA club , the FCCLA , the confetti club those club are really fun to do. you get to make new friends too if you waned to and when your in high school if you wanted to, you could run for school present for your school and make some changes to your school.

after school activity like sport can school clubs can also be on your patent reared all out throw out high school and on to college and thats why i think that student should participate in one or more extracurricular activity.

9E753C182039,"What I believe is that your either trying to get attention or really going through a hard difficult time and the people you already went to and gave you advice didnt really help with what you going through or trying to do. You really just want a person to give you really good advice and see if it help you, if it doesnt help you go talk to another person and see if the advice they give you is more comfortable and helping. The reason some people do this is because they probably get the same advice the other person already told you and already tried doing that and it just doesnt seem to do anything really. What i would to is try to go find a person that has been through the stuff your going through/trying to do and take their advice it really help because that person has already been through those things or tried to do those things and went to someone that has already been through it to and took their advice and it really seem to work.

They might just also go get advice from multiply people to see which advice the person gives them is best. They can also just be going to person to person for advice to see if they are really there and car about you when your going through a really difficult time. They can be doing that because the person they went to first was not really giving them advice about what your going through and just throwing things in that dont even make sense. I would just go to someone that really gets you and is there for you and knows how you feel.

Some people that do this just really want comfort because you never know what their going throw and really just wanna take everything off there mind and just want advice for all the things their going through. It really is hard to find someone with good advice but you never seem to find a person that give you that one good advice.

students needs their phones so they can contact their family if some thing happens or their family get robbed then how are you going to communicate. cell phones are okay but students are always texting during class when teachers are teaching. the cell phones company are starting to make new cell phones and people are starting to buy fancy phones like droid so are the students. cell phones are very cool to have and its kind of a lot of money to pay for those fancy phones. all students are buying cool phones cause they think they are cool cause other kids has cheap ones and telling them their phones are ugly. students are mean cause they could use someone's number and tell them awful stuff and would say the same thing what they say. so i say lets not have cell phones at school that would be okay to me.",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0
9EBCC1131B13,"As we have two different people, we have two types of parents that one of them, they believe and they force their children that should take some classes like music, drama, or an art class instead of elective classes. But another parents they do not believe and force them to take those classes. On the other hand we have some students that they like to take elective classes instead of those classes; and in opposite, we have students that they do not like to take elective classes.

In general, as we know the place of schools, we can easily discover that students need have some classes that they want to be and they like to enjoy it and has fun and exciting for them. Here are some reasons that is showed why they have to take those classes; like music, a drama, or an art class. First reason is if they took those classes, they can decrease their stress that they have in their life and their school. Second reason is, they can easily figure out what skills are they have in their life and out of the main classes in school. Third reason is, if they really learned from those classes, they can teach to another persons and get money for that. Fourth reason is, it is good for their health from all aspects. Fifth reason is, it gives them energy; so they can always be active in their life specially in their school.

First, on the other hand, some students is special because maybe they came from another country or have special condition that they not required to take those classes because they have to graduate or because of their English language; so they have to study and practice more; and they can not require to take those classes. They have to take main and elective classes that their counselor suggested to them. for example, I came from another country so I have to practice more in my English language and other main classes that I have in school, for these reasons I could not take an art, music or a drama class.

Second, another students just take those classes because their parents want to, so these students can not learn and enjoy from those classes and even they will hate from those classes. for example, I saw my friends that he took a music class but he did not like that, but their parents force and required him to take that class, in summary he fell from all classes that he had in his school, and finally he did not graduate from school because of that.

Third, some students that know English language include writing, speaking and listening, and has all A's in their main classes like Physics, Math and Chemistry and another main classes, they can take music, an art or a drama class. As I said some benefit of those classes on above, they can improve their skills and they can go in forward to their life that they want to be.

Finally, those classes can be help students a lot, but it has hinge on their status, and no one should not force students to take those classes unless they want to and they like to take those classes.

In conclusion, those classes should not be compulsory, because in general, each work should has be with love, until we can learn and help others and improve ourselves.                                           ",4.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5

A00A8837B25B,"Anybody is capable of doing anything no matter how bad obstacles can get. Failure is one of the biggest reasons why most of people are successful. Although people believe setting our aim low, and achieving our mark is less dangerous than aiming high and failing, nevertheless, aiming low, and achieving our mark is a greater danger because there's no limits to what people can do and failure gives motivation to work harder to achieve more and be successful in life.

To begin, setting our aim low, and achieving our mark is a greater danger than setting our aim high and falling short because there's no limits to what a human being can do and achieve. For example, Isaiah Thomas, he was one of the best basketball players in the NBA at Boston. He's very short, and everyone doubted him and said he's too short and can't make it. That didn't stop him from aiming high and achieving his goal and becoming of one the shortest people to make it to the NBA. This shows that no matter who the person is, they can accomplish a lot in life as long as they work hard. Clearly, everyone should always aim high and accomplish their goal to have a better life later on.

Furthermore, people should always aim high even if they fall short because failure gives motivation to achieve more and come back stronger. For instance, The Golden State Warriors lost the NBA finals in 2016. It was one of the worst finals ever for them. They lost very badly, but that didn't stop them from coming back the next year and winning the championship. This proves that it doesn't matter how bad failure can be, as long as they come back from it stronger. Obviously, no should be scared of failure and everyone should aim high and try to be the best at whatever they do.

Overall, the greater danger for most of people lies in not trying their hardest to be someone in life and aiming low to accomplish their goal because failure motivates the person to comeback stronger and have no limits. In conclusion, Aiming high will get anyone successful as long as they keep working hard and fear nothing.",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0
A0B2BF94231C,"First impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree because when you look at a person for less than 6 seconds you think you know that person. Until you have a coversation with that person at least for ten mintutes. Your impression will change. However i disagree that first impressions is almost impossible to change. The reason why is that the way a person looks,personality, and their communication skills are always that change your whole point of view of that person. From your first impression, when you look at them.

However the way a person looks from your first impression isnt always who they really are. Your observation on someone aren't truely who they are. The person can be good looking person you've ever seen and you really want to meet them. Until they are the wost person, that you hate so much. This also works the other way around too, the person could be the ugliest person you have ever met, but you never gave them a chance. Thats when you realize that, that person is really good. Its also like dont judge a book by its cover. Until you actually meet that person and get to know them.

Personality can change your first impression. Personality is mostly who you are finding out, who that person is, can be life changing. For you not knowing who someone is can have a big change for you. You really dont know who you are really meeting. Personality gives great insights in that person and who they really are. Also however they want to come out to you.

Also communication is key its really important to have communication. Communication gives confidence to the other person who you are communicating with. That shows that you understand the other person and feel comfortable with them. Having good eye contact and hearing all the information of the conversation that they are giving you, makes them open more up to you.

Additionally, i disagree that the first impression is almost impossible to change. Their personality, the way they look, and communication skills can always change your whole point of view on a person. Looks can be looks, personality being honest no matter what. Communication skills are you by listening, can help you on your first impression. Therefore by taking the time, day, hours , and effort to get to know someone can benefit you from not judging a book by its cover.

The reasons that most schools have free computer or laptops for all students for educational purposes, and distracting other students, teachers, and the student, who does as well, with out even knowing that .

Most or every school has too many online items for student to use for example, in my school we use laptop and iPad as a main educational resources to do the class work. Using the school resources with free internet, and that allow teachers to know what is everyone doing and help them if they need to. Also, that most schools have a libraries have a lot of the best free educational recourse for all students, so that make students have too many options instead of using their own cell phones in classroom.

Moreover, using cell phone in the classroom would distract others students with their class work for example, I prefer using the outline resource instead of the online once, so I can not focus to my class work when students use their cell phones around me. Also, using cell phone in the classroom could be less useful compare to how it could take students attention to the cell phone Social Medea world or the online world, so if one student didnt use the cell phone in the right way or for an educational purposes all the classroom's people, teacher and students, wold be distract out of their subject and lose their class time.

Others people might have another opinion about that, for example the can say using the cell phone is useful for student for educational purpose and contact family. That can be right when we can be sure that all teenager students would do this. Also that every school has a free phone for students to contact their families if their is a need.

Therefore, using cell phone in the classroom is less use that it's, because that would wast all class's time, and students have more options to search online for their class work.

A22BC15DDB95,"To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted four-day work week, with each day consisted of ten hours. Like other places, the energy conservation in the school is also important. To have four-day school with additional two hours, is not a good idea due many problems.

Having four-day school is a good idea, because of some advantages. By having three days off from school student will have more time to do other things such as, they can spend more time on job, sports, picnics, other courses, etc. The students will have more time to relax and the students will be mentally well prepared for coming work days. Due to this, we can also conserve large amount of energy and other resources.

On the other hand, it also has a lot of disadvantages. By having two additional hours every day the student will be tired and they have to do more work every day. As a result, the students will not able to pay attention toward learning. When you are tired you can not able to pay full attention toward studies, due to which this is useless because students will not able to learning anything. This will also effect their grades. The students that do part time job they will face problem in doing that. The students who are willing to participate in extra curriculum activities, they will not able to participate in it. These are the reason that makes it a bad idea.

Four-day work week have more disadvantages. To make education and studies wealthy, we should not adopt it because it makes the studies and learning worthless. That is why having f our-day work week is a bad idea.                                    ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0

However they should considered that energy and resources benefits us and the world, we mostly need energy in everything to survive and resources its a natural source of wealth or revenue that enhances the quality of human life, if businesses have adopted a four day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours to conserve energy and resource for their future, my school should follow this model because i think schools are the most who spend and waste energy and resource by their thousands of students that attempt there.

With a four-day school week , student would at least get rid of depression which adds unnecessary stress, they will have a one break day to do their homework and assignments without staying up all night just to finish it, at the same time it will benefit the environment by just having a four day school week , it will be harder for them to adapt for a longer days of school and a shorter week of school, some of them will not adapt to it but still it would help them to be more time at home with their family instead of be at school stressing.

Whatever, If parents and students got the benefit of having a day off, parent will have the time that they didnt have before with their kids they will more hours of work and school but still it may help them to have a better connections, and at least they would have a day off stressing and worrying about their work and assignments.

In Conclusion, cutting one day out of school would be helpful for young teenagers who are studying and working at the same time to help their families, and it would conserve much energy and resource than before, making our environment greater by conserving energy and resource in only four days of work for adults and four days of school for teenagers who attempt to any school.

Examples would be Cahoot is this game where you and your classmates play the teacher gives questions and whoever gets the most right wins at the end of the game sometimes the Teacher might give you a reward for winning. There is also coolmath it's not one particular game but its a website with tons and tons of games you can play math games there really fun.

""I would say lots of people that go to public schools have played that game because it's just that popular and fun. Especially cahoot every kid that attends a public school has played this game either to study or just have some free time.

But there are other things like doing a science experiment you could find interesting things that you never knew before, also playing an instrument ""if you enjoy music thats really fun you can learn how to play a instrument,You could also be in a play if you like acting anything that fits your interest and is educational you should try it.

A2EA2D3D0542,"Have you ever worked individually on an assignment and was stuck and had no motive to keep pushing? well if yes I'm here to tell you why working with a group is more beneficial then working alone. I believe working with a group is far more easier than working alone,communication is key. Therefore if you have communication you don't have to do as much work; just have to gather your thoughts and put them together and let it make sense. Group work has to be one of the most easiest things as an highschooler group work assignments are the best,hearing what others have to say can really open up the brain. Sometimes group work may be challenging but it also helps you in the real world which us people need which takes me to my next topic; respecting everyone ideas and having a goal.

Group work isn't always about who has the most ideas or who can put it together and what not,It's more of letting people get their thoughts out. Having one or two individuals speaking over everyone can affect the whole group chemistry,making sure everyone is conformable before you start is very helpful of the process. Working with a group you have to come up with a goal;However every goal has a destination. Therefore if everyone in the group has a designated job too do no matter what they're working towards the same goal. In my opinion goals are good when doing anything when there is a goal to accomplish it just pushes the work ethic to obtain that goal. History shows you that having a destination pushes the brain to do better and has a big effect on the outcome.

Personally,as I work in groups I collect other peoples ideas and analyze their way of thinking and use it to my advantage. This helps expands the thought process as many can see a different perspective on things. It's actually amazing how someone thoughts can open multiple thoughts for an individual that didn't even know they could think of such thing,that's why I stress so much about group work it can be rough,frustrating,inpatient but at the end its all worth it. Another way you can think of it;lets say you were working alone and you got your project done,well that's okay but wouldn't you want to know more about whom ever you are? wouldn't you want to get pushed out of a shell and experience new things. Also a group is not always a maximum group of 5-7 people it can also be about just 3 maybe even two.

Group work has more pros than cons; criticisms is in the category or pros if were being honest, even if your partner not giving you as much feedback your at least getting something. Than not getting anything at all in my opinion people that work by themselves are just flat out :selfish,hard headed,and think they're too good for everyone. While people are working alone they could be working on their work place readiness skills.

However,some may say working alone is much more precise than working with a group,In some ways they are correct. Yes the process goes faster and there is less to do;as a team may have to do more before they get started. Also you can state your own ideas how and where you want it to go without someone thinking otherwise of that thought. All around working alone much faster than working with a group but if you ever want to get to that next step/level your going to have too sit down with a group of peers and express your feeling which takes:character,time and patient.

I have come to the end of my writing I hope I have changed your perspective on things and hope you even learned something with reading my essay. I just want everyone out there to know accepting critsm isn't bad neither is accepting that you are wrong and someone else is right. So take that next step and go interact with others to better yourself!",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0
A336FB5F2623,"Having online classes could be so much helpful and easier for those kids who doesn't leave near the school, or doesn't own car, it could be helpful because student wouldn't had to wait outside for a bus to pick them up, or for someone to take them to school, it could be easier because they could finish their classes from their house they would just need any electronic device and a connection to WIFI.

By having online classes I think it could make students life much easier, because if they get sick they can still take their classes and they wouldn't have to worry about making other students sick and there would be less chances of getting sick by other student, student would not have any excuse for not taking their classes, taking online classes could also help those student who are always late to school because they would take their class from their house so any bad weather could not be an obstacle.

There are many good thing about taking classes online but there always somethings students would need to give in order to have this benefits and that thing is social life, many students would never see their friends again because everyone has a different mind no everybody has the same goals and not everyone likes the same stuff so in my opinion thats one negative thing of online classes, but there are always a solution the teacher could make a project that could involve working in groups and I think online classes could change students life.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0
A38A3B76558A,"Nowadays, the majority of students in high schools do not think about their future for many factors: time, dedication, or buget. Schools are a very important tools to help students to realize how important is to to commit to a career at a young age, because It is something that will help them for their future. It is a good idea for many reasons: prepares students as a future adults, keep them focus in their goals, and It gives students the time to realize what could be the ideal career for them.

One important reason, is to prepare students as a future adults, because each person has a responsibility as an adult, and this a good skill for each student to learn and built a knowledge when they get to the point of being an adult. For example, at a young age like teenagers in high school are able to absorb new ideas and words everyday to built their knowledge, and have the ability to apply it in the future for their career. This is really important, because this will help to molding them as a future adults for the society.

Also, It is a good idea to for students to commit to a career at a young age, because It keeps them focus in their goals. By selecting a career at a young age, students can be focus on what they want or what do they need to achieve it. For example, schools can provide vital information about the career students may select, depending on the course they like. How much is it cost, how long it may take, and do they need to know about the career. This is really important, and it can motivate students to follow their dreams, and strive to achieve their goals.

In addition, It gives students the time to realize what could be the ideal career for them. Each person needs the time to know what could be the ideal career or job in order to keep foward. For example, if a student is in his or her first year of high school and she or he wanted to be a doctor, but it realized that now he or she wants to be a teacher. The student still has the chance to change its mind and can choose the career of becoming a teacher. That is why is really important to have the time to think about a career at a young age.

In conclusion, commiting a career at a young age is really important, because it can help people focus in what they want to be. At a young age, shows the level of mindset of each person, and who wants to be succesful in life. Starting from a young age does not mean people have a final desicion, but it may be an idea in general that everybody should practice at a young age to not have struggles in future decisions, and it would be more easy to choose a specific career.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0

If they are forced then they might like it when the class goes on, but if you say take the class or you won't pass then they will pass the class then just not doing anything. Say one student who doesn't like art but he takes it and he goes on and become a popular artist, then people will think I should try those classes and see. Say, they did take the class because it was required but they fail, the passing average of that class will go from high to low because of it bring required. If they say it's required for half a year than full year then, I will choose they are but if it's for whole year I will choose they aren't required.

I think they aren't required to take those classes, because those classes aren't meant for them. Because say they want to go for other things after high school that doesn't need music, arts and drama then it was just a waste of their school time studying those, but not the one that you need for after high school. They will take it but they won't do anything in the class if they are forced to take what they doesn't like. I think school just have some class that are mandatory to take but elective aren't mandatory to take. Those classes should be elective than are required to take all those class.

In conclusion that, if they choose it's required to take those class, it might change their subject on what to do after school, but for some it will not change it. If they choose not to make it required than it will have their passing average higher than going low, and that the student can take the classes they want to take. So I think that those classes aren't required to take unless they want to take.

The climate of a bearded dragons natural habitat is very hot since they can be found every where in Australian deserts.

I want my bearded dragon to grow up being friendly, and not so aggressive, so since bearded dragons are social animals they often need to be in contact with a person and keep being played with or can be taken out of its tank and let it roam around the room.

Debate between benefits and disadvanges. Resume any doing school activities on regular five school day and change that for only four day.

To have a four-day school week, is an option that has to be adopted not only for some of the businesses workers and also by each high school and higher education school after see this reasons.

That is consisting of lose ten hour per week. but those missing hour can be recoup it by extending the school day two hour and increase the time for each class per day, that is an option to increase the atention and time on each class and complete any proyect or assigment toll by your teacher, and if we get the extra two hours, we can get more time with friends and teacher for suport between us on any class someone is failing.

Also, we can adopted an option for the fourth day on the extra two hours, used for time on the library, that can be amazing for the sturent who love reading, or students who love extra time on the sports, or any activity after school.

The fifth day of the week can be used for doctor appoinments or any health situations, you know the great excuse for missing classes on regular school time is because the parents write a note explaining we will be absent of some periods of classes. Doing any that situation on not regular time of school will deacrese the sturent missing on any period of class.

Without forget the teacher's situations who are the parents at the same time and need one extra day for family time and doing regular acctivities with their sons if that they have.

Don't forget the situations on seniors who are the most difficult situations on their life, decide for future, and they need time for keeping all option from universities and college for do the next step, higher education nad considered also job for weekends, also about freshman, who are the chlidren from middle school, they are the situation on needing understanding from extra activities on high school changed from their last rutine.

Another opctions for Friday or Monday free day can be used for community service, with permition of parent and some supervision of some adults, any students who wants participate on this can go and help on cleaning up street and river or any help on relation with community service, also the schools can create any program that consist on get many big companies who wants help students find a job on this new free day and may be part-time on weekend.

Considering:

Only four-day school, forget about the fifth day on school (No coming a little time for five days use the full time on four days)

three free days per week (use this extra time on family or friends meeting, any thing you and your parents want)

No wake up on Friday mornings or may be Monday mornings (dependes on the detition of the school about which day is going to be the third free day, use time for rest and complete responsabilities)

This idea can be not convenient for students with part-time job, because by following this model by extending the school day two hour will decrease the student's time sheet, even though if every one on this situation can use the fifth school day that will be free for a full-time job and get three full-time job.

Always remain. BE ON TWO DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES PER DAY CAN BE HARD AND EXHAUSTING, going school than going to work is exhausting because you don't have time for rest. But, if you get only four school days even though the school increase two hours you will have time after school for rest and doing any proyect or homework and use the other three days for any job you think is convenient.

Knowing disadvantages also remain the solutions and benefits for each disagreement on this proyect, because there are ore of the benefits than disadvantages for more 90 percent of the students.

After mention all points on considering benefits and disadvantages and solutions on that. To a four-day school week. Willingly I conclude with ""Everyone need a three day free from school and just four days on school"". Even though if any student's situation is diferent for using this free day, stay in home, family rutines, helping on home rutines, working or studing.

A4CD4307D620,"Part of growing in this life is having the right type of mindset and skill you want for yourself only. The things I have learned in today's day is probably not really achievable because people give up to easy and think it's hard to fix cars. I like to build and take apart engines or even add parts to get more potential out of any car I purchase. I love to race cars and also flip my money too. That all takes skill but you don't learn if your not taught in life.

Likewise myself , for 11 years my father taught me how to use his tools and fix little things on any car he had at the moment. We would sell them and flip the money beacuse we'd be the ones fixing them up a bit. When I got my very first car it had no motor in it and bought it for six hundred dollars. I myself bought the motor for a thousand and installed the whole thing by myself but yet with the right tools it was then worth five thousand because of how many miles the engine was and how clean the interior and exterior was. I would always becareful though when it came to turbo the engines. You'd need to hook a special computer on it to tune the compter of the engine so it doesn't blow up on you. I'd love to race and compete against other peoples builds for money on the track. The best part of mastering this skill is that I will never need a mechanic to fix my own car again.

Another skill I have become really good at is gaming and playing the fracnchise called Call of duty. These types of games are shooter games and it all depends on how fast your sensitivity is and how fast you can react to whatever is happening in the game. When it comes to gaming I like to post videos online of how good I am because I can also get paid through how many people watch my videos. Some people like the entertainment but more like to see how fast the reactions I have. That type of skill has helped me so much in life because it has always helped me make the right decsions when I am driving on the road even in school it has helped me remember and react a little faster then others in class. This skill improves everyday because it's affected my everyday life. Through this I've mastered to actually get through everday life without having such stress because I am always prepared to react and decide what is good for me.

All in all I agree with Ralph Waldo he is right without trying something new you won't grow at all. The human brain is mean't to be expanded and stretched like a muscle to learn new things like playing a sport , remembering equations in physics and solving over and over again and still getting logical answers , to be good at something takes practice , but to master whatever you want to master takes brilliance.

A5056E812783,"If you ask people ""When are you feel happy?"". Most of them can respond that they feel happy in some kind when they are succesful, with a less of problems and failures. But what are in the another side of this success? How people get this success? Nobody can't tell whole way of getting succesful. But why?

Everyone went a hard, full of pitfall way. It wasn't easy, it was hard when you tried to achieve one's goal. Succesful people hadn't easy way of getting succesful. Failure is in some kind examination, challenge for us when we are trying to stay succesful. Succesful people must pass all kind of failure examination that to show that they are strong, sturdy, and patient. Success doesn't like weak and whiner people.

For example, famous people like musicians and composers: Bach, Mozart, Beethoven; writers like Shakespeare, Stendal, Tolstoy, and Pushkin; scientics like Einshtein and Tesla. They all are famous now, because in their time they had goal: be succesful and do those things that they are like to do by their soul and heart. They had failures and opponents, peoples who just only hate and envy them. And now you're just can only imagine on how much those people were full of enthusiasm and pation that we know about them now, in our time. They are examples of succesful people for us now.

Nobody of famous and succesful people don't tell you that it was easy way of stay succesful. Because it is true. And everyone has different failures; you can't feel those failures like feels those person by itself. And nobody can't tell you that the way to stay success will be easy. It is a very big number of people, who pray to achieve their goal, but with the first failures they just stopped and go back, they loss their enthusiasm. And this people just need to be pushed with someone with the words ""Hey! What's happen? This is all all that you can show? Other people have more failures then you, you must go forward! You mustn't to be afraid to see with your eyes your failure. You must be strong."" And I think they can find some strength.

There are a lot of different meetings, conferences, and seminars with a succesful and famous in some way people. There you can hear more good things that can help you to improve, to achieve your goal and stay succesful. But you can't hear all of the failure that would be connected personaly with you, and on how much it can be hard, that you still have enthusiasm that help you to solve your problems and improve. When you stay on the way to achieve your goal, because of the failures you can forget why you do all this things, you need to remember all of the good things you now that will be when you achieve your goal and stay, at first, success for yourself. With a failures you stay more self-controlled, and grew up more inside of you, stay more confident in your deed.

In our life we stay succesful with everyday for ourself too. We have some small and big goals that we want to achieve. Our life is the way to stay succesful. We are achieve our goals for stay succesful in the school, in the college or university, in the sport, and on the work.

To stay succesful it is not easy way with a failures that pursuit us. But we need remember for what we stay on this way, way to stay succesful.",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.5
A570CD64F0F9,"A single persons actions can change how other people act. Albert Schweitzer, a philosopher said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing"". I agree with his statement and believe it as true, as most people look up to and copy whoever is currently popular on social media. People also like to follow the example of what they are taught, by parents or teachers. In this essay, i'll be talking about how setting an example for others is the best way to influence others into doing something.

First of all, Watching someone do something that interests you could influence you into doing the same. For example: if you like food and you watch someone cook, it could possibly persuade you into making your own food. Most of the time, people would not do something without being influenced or persuaded by someone else. Take Juuling for example, most kids would never do such a thing unless being persuaded or peer pressured by their friends.

Secondly, Teaching someone to do good by an example is also good, as it sets them down a good path, just as most parents do. A person cant do something they were never taught or ever learned, so they look to other people who can do things; and look up to them. Only by setting an example can others follow. Much like a pack of wolves, the leader sets an example and rest follow it.

It could be argued that a speech or something of the sort could also influence people, such as Martin Luther King Jr's ""I Have A Dream"" speech. In the past that might have been the best way to influence people, but in modern day society a majority of people are influenced by action and examples. Otherwise, why would kids be doing these ""Challenges"" that you hear on the news every other day?

In conclusion, Examples are the best and most effective way to influence others into doing things. By setting examples, people are influenced into doing all sorts of things. Whether they are good or bad is completely subjective and depends on what the person is influenced into doing.

A66E85DB3C56,"In the modern times kids want to stay out late until 2-3 in the morning, but it is not safe for kids to be staying out that late. Especially, teenagers now days get more in trouble late at night because they do illeagal things. often times teens go to parties and drink underage which is bad for their health. usually, curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because, if there was no curfew teens would stay out late, do illeagel stuff ,and get them self in deep trouble.

Teenagers would be in trouble and also in danger if they don't follow the curfew. It is dangerous for teens to stay out late because the world we live in now is not as safe as we think it is. There has been a lot of kidnapings and sex trafficking happening in the United states it is best for teenagers to stay home past curfew. If they want to go out somewhere past the curfew then they always have a choise to go with their parents. Usually, most teens don't have a license so they would uber their way to wherever their destination is and ubering at night is dangerous because, teens can get kidnap or anything bad can happen to them, so that staying out after curfew could get teens in trouble and in danger.

If teenagers start to stay out after the curfew technically they would be breaking the law. They can get in a lot of trouble from their parents and the police for breaking the law. Teens tend to go to parties a lot and they drink under age which can get them in trouble with the law and also it is bad for their health. Another example why teenagers shouldn't be out after curfew is because, most teenagers when they go to paties they smoke which is really bad for their health. The parties they go to are sometimes on weekdays and it ends around 2-3 in the morning which is way past the curfew. If the teens come home that late at night they wont be able to get proper sleep because, they have school so getting less than 5 hours of sleep is not good for teenagers health at all. It is best for teenagers to stay home after curfew and get a good night sleep.

Now days teenagers don't spent so much time with their parents. The curfew could help their parents spend some extra time with their kids. If the teenagers wants to hangout past curfew they can always go to their friends house or their friends could come to their house with their parents permission and they can hangout and be safe at the same time. Staying after curfew would definetly keep teenagers out of danger and trouble. Teens can aslo have extra time to their homework. It is best for teenagers to stay home past curfew for their own safety.

All the reasons that are above is only because, so it shows what would happen if the teens don't follow the curfew. If the city council wants to keep the kids safe, healthy, and out of danger they should definetly have the curfew. The best way to keep the kids safe is to make them follow the curfew for their own safety. The curfew is there for the protection of the teenagers.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5

For example Bullying is serious and negavtive effect on us, Bullying isn't just physical contact there is cyber bullying and that's were the technology come in. Another negative effect that technology has given us is No Contact, The new genration does not have contact as like people would have had before. We need contact becuase it shows that we can work with people and it also shows that we are social.

One positive thing about technology is new research for example now a days we can just go on google and search up things we might need help with, For example if you are confused over a topic or you want to know a little bit more about it you can just go on google and search it up. Another positive effect technology has given us is Locations, Locations is a part of everyday's life for example if you need to go somewhere you can just go on your phone and search up the name of the place where you want to go. Technology is something we need now a days because there's creations all over the world being created everyday.

Human contact is what we expect but now a days we can't find that because it either go on snapchat, instagram, or add a friend on facebook even adults do this not just kids and teens.

A72F4E50ED92,"Working with group is more beneficial because, if a person work in group then he/she can share thought and ideas before start working. Also, it helps student to learn how to communicate with other team member because team work is very important and necessary to learn before students start working professionally.

I believe that working in group will gives student more ideas and everyone in group can share their thoughts with each other. It also helps students to finish their work on time and the most important is that not only one person have burden to do all work. Communication is the key of working in group because, group working is also helps students to learn how to communicate and how people should behave when they work as a team.

Team work and communication is very important to learn before a person go to college or before start working professionally because, if a person does not have ability to work in team then it would be very hard to adjust in college or professional work environment. There are many advantages of working in group for instance, student can plan and share ideas with their group, they can discuss the work with each other before the start work on any project and they can also help each other if any of the group member is confused in anything. The most important part of the any project or any other work is finish on time and if not then no matter how much hard work the person put is just useless. Group working is also save time because everyone work together rather then only one person has burden to complete all work.

To conclude, I just want to mention that I understand that working alone is more beneficial for some people but, working in group is much better more easier than working alone. For instance, working in group gives more ideas from different people's sense of humor and people get chance to work with different people whose thoughts and working style is different.

A79B40F29DCA,"A positive attitude is the key to success in life because it can lead you to having a good job, being well respected by others, having others look up to you, and you should never give up on yourself. Many people have positive attitudes because it can have a good outcome in the long run and help them in their future. Personally I think that having a good attitude can take you far in life. Remaining positive is really the key to accomplishing your goals.

I used to be the type of person who wouldn't really have a good attitude because I was usually afraid of what people would say or I would fear that they would disrespect me because I wouldn't have my guard up. Over the years I learned to manage a good attitude no matter what the situation may be because you never know what someone may be going through and you wouldn't want to treat them even worse than what they are going through. I used to work at Chipotle and having that job taught me to have patience and also maintain a good attitude towards other people, even if they didn't deserve to be treated good. The reason I said it's taught me to be better is because I experienced a customer who was being really racists, although I didn't want to be respectful and I wanted to lash out I thought to myself that I needed to be the grown person and just try my best to ignore their comments and keep going on with my day because having a negative attitude can result to deeper problems and the outcome wouldn't have been the best. My mom is the person who's always told me to treat others the same way you would like to be treated and ever since i've always kept that in mind and tried my best to remain positive. I try my best to a good role model with positive intentions because I know my younger siblings are looking up to me and I don't want to be the person who fails them.

Most jobs would require for you to have a positive attitude because of the way their industry may work. The reasons why they would want someone who has a good attitude is because they have to interact with people, set an example for future employers, and also to satisfy the customers. If your boss were to see what a good worker you are and they see how you manage certain situations they could even give you a raise because they can see the dedication you have for the job. Although at jobs sometimes it can be hard to remain positive because of the situations some customers or even coworkers put you in but I personally think sometimes as individuals we need to put out pride aside and be the bigger person and resolve the issues or just walk away without adding more problems. For some jobs you really have to face hard obstacles and it could get tiring and you would just want to give up but people should always remember that all the hard work you're doing now will be worth it in the end and they would be able to see their accomplishments.

Finally, I think school is the hardest place to remain positive because it brings so much stress to certain people that they don't know how to cope with it. I personally expierence this because I am not the best in school and sometimes I just ask myself

""what is the point of doing all this?"". I usually tend to give up when my classes get too stressful for me and I end up failing my class, I try my best to think of the good outcome it will bring me but sometimes I just feel like giving up because I don't think I will be someone big in the world and that is the worst mindset someone can have because as humans we all make mistakes but we should always think that we can better ourselves, if we only think negative then our situations may end up worse. The best way for you to remain positive is to remind yourself the reason why you are doing it and to show appreciation to those who never gave up on you even when you gave up on yourself. I think that I need to remain positive so I can prove to those who doubted me wrong and I can show them that I am capable of doing good even without their help because in the end the only person you truly have is yourself. Most importantly, I need to prove to myself that if I continue being positive then I will graduate and I will accomplish my goals all because I had a positive attitude rather than a negative attitude and bringing myself down. As an example right now I don't think I did good on this essay but i'm going to be thinking that I tried my best and if anything I could always try again until I get it right.

In conclusion as individuals we should always remain positive and keep trying our best because in the end it will all be worth it, even if it takes days, months, or even years. I know sometimes all someone does is think negative and it can put them in a really low place in life but they should always know to never give up. Sometimes life can get too stressful and there's no positive thinking involved but I really hope that everyone can think positive in certain situations and that they can continue to live happily and see that every obstacle they went through will be worth it. To be successful in life you have to keep trying until you get it right and you acknowledge those situations and you have the mindset that you can really accomplish thing if you put your mind and attitude first.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5
A7CC5A46675A,"In my opinion, most of the students are finish with their corse classe already by their junior year. Therefore, I think that having the program in our high school can benefit us. Some ways that it can benefit us by preparing us to go to college, it gives us more time to be with our family during the weekday, and it gives us time to work.

Preparing for college, can be very emotional and physically exausted. Some of the reason is that we are worring on which college we want to study or does your ""GPA"" is sufficient good that any college will accept us. One example I have about getting ready to go to college is that once upon a time, my big brother was going to college and his GPA was 2.9 he was so anxious because he couldn't get to any if the colleges that he really wanted to go to. He kept searchign for colleges that offered a basketball course and he had found out that our school had a program for basketball. As soon as he found out he signed up and was accepted real quick.

Another reason, on which it's good to have programs in our school is that we can actually spend more time with our family because we will be able to be at our house earlier. One time I was at school and my sister was in the hospital but I could not be at the hospital with her because I had three sol's that week. Everyday when I got out of school she was already asleep and wouldn't wake-up until the next morning, she had neumonia so we could barely talk a litlle bit. My point is that if I or my brother had the choice to be in the program we could've be with our sister because we wouldv'e been out at 1:30pm.

My last reason, is that having a program also helps us to have more time in the afternoon to work and help our family with families with their bills and their needs. We can also, save money for our college and for our selfs too. In my opinon, we have to work hard to get what we want, and what ever is that we are working for, will come with lots of blessings.

In conclusion, we should have a program in our school so that we can grow more as professionals and have more responsabilties. We can prepare for college, be with our family, and work while we are in the program. Also, we can helps those who are still in ninth, tenth, or eleventh grade accompish their goals same way as we did but, we have to be thankful with those who helped us reached our goals.

Imagination is what you want it to be, nobody can control it because it's yours to keep and think about in your mind.

Einstein was one of the smartest human beings on earth known to man kind. He was the creator of the space and time theories that in my opinion, I like very much.

Albert Einstein had to use imagination and knowledge at the same time in order to come up with those theories. He also needed knowledge in order to know what was out there in deep space and to know the truth behind black holes and all that cool\space stuff. Imagination is a real thing. Imagination is better than knowledge because its there with you forever. Knowledge is taught to you, but what is taught to you, you might forget it in the future. Also things that you learn in life might not be used in the future or in the career you fore seek to be doing. Even though knowledge is really important to learn, it may go away or you might not need it in the future career or job you wish to do.

Life is full of bad people. If you have ever done something wrong, you might want to ""think before you act."" If you were to do something without knowing the consequences, you're going to get in trouble. What if bad people that are in jail right now, would've thought of the consequences before committing the crime? Yea, they probably wouldnt of done it. Example, if you wanted to prank a teacher on the last day of school or hitting a school clock, causing it to fall and break, you might want to think before you act.

You might also want to ""imagine"" what would happen to you in the future if you did something wrong. Another good reason is to learn from your mistakes. Since you already did them you're have a good visual of what you might expect to happen to you in the future if you did something wrong without thinking about it. you might also want to have knowledge because if you thought of the consequences and or imagined them, you wouldnt of done it in the first place.",3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0
A828480AA508,"Successes comes in so many diffrent whays,but the real questchon is how can having a good attitude lead you to being more successesful in life. I think that starts with your attitude ,attitude plays a big part in your life, for example if your about to take a really big test in math class and you tell yourself befor the teast that your going to fail and your just having a negtive attitude about it, your more likely to fail ,but if you walk into math class with a good attitude and your cofdent in yourself and your just going to give it your beast I thinkyour more likely to pass the teast.

When you think of successes you think of famos people you might think of a person on tv or someone that hass lots of money. If you think about it the people you wach on tv or any of the people you think are successesful hade to have strugled in life to get to the place they are now. What ever the strugle was they hade to get back up and push themself. There are successesful people every where fot example it could be your mom, or your dad, brother, sister any one you know. Successes doesnt have to be a big thing it could be you doing something like running a mile or being the first person in your familly to go to college or just geting all As in school Whatever it is having a good attitude in life can really change your life.

I try to be as successesful as I can if thats in school I try my beast,Whatever it is I know I cant acomlish anything without a good attitude. For example in the fuetre I want to be a fashon disinor, but that whount hapen for years but thers things I can do to push myself to the thing I want to do. Things I can do now to get to my futer ,I can start with a postive attitude There are hatters every where that try to bring you down you just have to learn how to ignore them and learn how to creat a path for yourself.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.0
A93072F1F0EC,"I disagree about what the principal has decide because some student don't like sports or any other activities at school. They are probably don't do that activities because they don't know how to play or do those activities and some activities you have to buy all the things that you need for that activities but they don't have money to buy all the stuff.

Other people might fortgot to give the paper that they need for the sports or any kinda of activities and they cant go or play sports just because of that reason and some people dont do a sports because other student will judges them because they might be bad at playing that sports and they will judges them.

Other student played sports but scared to play now because she or he might got hurt when he played last time and she or he might got scared because of that reason and people will call him or her weak just because she or he fell or got hurt.

Not everyone are good at playing sports and even though they probably know how to play sports they might just be scared to play because they have shyness and people are lazy to do any kind of sports.

Not all of the student will follow the principal just because they dont probably know how to play the sports and they are shy to play when people are yeling and staring at them. Not everyone will do the sports just because the principal told them to do any other sports. People will just ignore the principal

They will get mad because if they have low grades they will get kick out of the team just because of the low grades. Other student aren't that good at doing sports but they will probably do better but they are scared to play sports because they see alot of the people who get hurt just because of a sports they dont want to get hurt because of a sports.

Some student will not do what the principal say because it's either they dont how to play the sports or they dont wanna play the sports and if they do play sports it's because they got force to play the sports because their parents and they dont want their parents to be mad or sad because they do sports.

Some people are scared because of a sports they might get hurt because of that sports.

They watch TV at home and it show how the people who play sports get hurt by playing sports and they are scared when people are staring at them.

Some people don't want to do the work for the year book because its boring and some people hates doing books stuff because it's boring and they hate books and some people don't like when they read books.

They do'nt want to do any other activities because it's not their type or they just hate doing all the stuffs. they are probably lazy to do that stuff at school and they just hate doing all that's stuff.       ",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
A98482015F5A,"There are many instances where people have the mindset that you must be doing something constantly in order to achieve the most. I believe that having this mindset is terrible and is not beneficial to the person. I believe this because if you take the time to rest you will find that it allows you to regain a creative mindset, it allows your work to regain its quality, and taking time to rest serves many health benefits.

Regaining a positive, creative mindset serves many purposes. Having a creative mindset will allow you to think freely, and come up with brilliant, unique ideas that give you an advantage over possible competition. For example, if you are constantly writing all the time you are not giving yourself time to create unique ideas that separate you from the rest of the competition. Another example we can use for this scenario is when an entrepreneur is constantly trying to start a business without taking a step back and allowing themselves to come up with a unique idea that they have passion for. Where as if someone who does take breaks is working in the same field as another individual they are working less, but achieving more because their ideas are more unique and thought through.

When you are constantly working there is a high chance that your work may lose its quality. When an individual is working the factor that they must think about most is the quality of the work they are providing. If the quality of the work is not there then it completely takes away from the rest of the qualities from that body of work. For example, if a man wants to sell a product, and he puts hours upon hours into this item but there is no quality then the item will not sell. Where as if the man takes constant breaks focusing on quality, and not quantity then the item will have a lot more attraction from people.

Being idle sometimes rather then working persistently also has its benefits. When working diligently all the time there may be times where you may be very stressed out or you've tired your body out, but these problems can be avoided. These problems can be avoided by taking breaks, taking breaks allows your mind to relax and release stress that has been piled over a certain amount of time. For example, if you are a athlete and you are constantly over working yourself there is a high chance you may get injured, but if you balance yourself and take breaks you are allowing your muscles to heal themselves which also boosts your performance for the next practice or game. Allowing yourself to take breaks also improves the quality of the work you provide whether its paperwork or sports.

Although some people think never being idle is a good thing because you can achieve more work with no set backs. I still think that being idle serves a purpose because you want to be able to incorporate quality into your work, you also want to be creative when it comes to providing, and lastly you want to be able to gain the benefits from relaxing your body and your mind. Finally, if you are one of the individuals who like to work diligently without breaks, you should at least consider taking a break once because it will not hurt you, and if anything it will help you.",4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0
A9ACA0A6ADE8,"The ancient Greek storyteller Aesop said,""No act of kindness, no matter how small,is ever wasted.""

In the futerch there will be more acts of kindness that way we can be happy with one another

I hope that I am right about there being more acts of kindness ,but there are not a lot of people who do acts of kindness. I feel that people should do more acts of kindness. If you have time go to a nursing home and bring flowers to the elderly women. You can make a now friend by doing something kind ,or by just being nines to them. We all have to do something for a act of kindness also by doing something like that you feel better about your self before you help someone. Make your friend happy by doing something kind for them because you never know what they are going though. You also never know what someone else is going though ether.

I think what the Greek storyteller Aesop is trying to say is just be kind to people. Doing a act of kindness can make someone happy if they had a bad day. For Example,if you help them water there plants you can make them happy. A good way to do a act of kindness is by helping your mom Cooke diner another way you can help is by doing something you don't have to be asked to do. We all have those day were it is just a bad one and you dont want to do any thing well if someone does something for you with them not knowing you had a bad day at school or at work. there should be more people to do something kind to other people.

For Example, it a trash day were it came later then before me, and my step brother had to take the trash done to the side of the road. Will there was elderly layde that was outside when i was outside. in the place

I lived in there were always contortion going on. when we were my step brother had to get something and i stayed outside when the workers began to work aging. When they starred they scared the lady that was outside. I had to make a diction on if I should go in and get my mom or go to the lady that fell. I got my mom and went to her then my mom called 911

to come get her. When you do a good thing for someone they feel happy even if it is a small thing you do for them. That's why we need more people to do more acts of kindness.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,2.5
AA0CD6D22CA3,"Identify a Career Before High School

Have you ever heard about those societies that expect students to identify a career before getting into high school? Last week I was reeding the newspaper and there was a special new that really got my attention. The new was talking about a new society which wants all students to idenfy a career before they get in high school. Because some students think is not necessary, there is a big debate going on.

I believe that is good to implant to students the idea to commit to a career before getting into high school because then when they start high school they will choose the necessary classes which will help them to earn knowledge of this career. Another reason is that they will not be getting distracted later on thinking about what career should they select. If the students choose a career before getting into high school, they will get mature and they will be prepared to be more formal and follow the steps to graduate on time and then start working on the few steps that they will have for achieving completely their dreamed career.

I believe that if studdents choose their career before starting high school it will be easier for them in the future. I have a niece that is in 8th grade in middle school, she is almost about to start high school. My niece was telling me the other day that she loves medicine, and she would love to become a doctor. She told me that she asked to her counselor for some classes recomendations. Her counselor recommended to her a medicine's academy and also some extra science and health classes. Now she is excited to start high school.

If students decide what career are they interested on before getting into high school will help them to clear their mind. Once they get the opportunity to choose their classes schudele for high school they will have in ind that they should pick classes that are related to the career that they want to achieve. When I was in high school I did not even know what a career was, because the teachers in middle school nor my parents never mentioned it. When I was going to start high school I remember that the summer after starting high school, all the future new niners were called to a meeting. In this meeting we were supposed to choose our new classes for our first year in high school. They gave us all a really big list of classes from where we could choose, and because I did no know anything, and I had not any plans for my future, I chose the same classes that my other friend was choosing. When I was in my Senior year the questions started ""so what is your plan after graduating?"" ""what is your dreamed career?"" I was completely lost, so I went to talk to my counselor and she explained me what a career was. I said I wanted to be periodist, and then I realized that I wasted my opportunities of earning knowledge and practice during my first high school years. I could have been in leadership class and learn how to talk to people, I could have been part of the high school newspaper, or take some classes where they teach you how to give speeches. After I graduated I had to take special courses online, because I did not know anything about periodism.

If students decide what career they want, they will feel cofidents and they will act in the way that this career asks for them to act. They will become more mature and take high school as a more serious thing. Some of my old class mates from when I was in high school were always playing around and getting in trouble, because they said high school did not really teach you what you ""needed"", but I believe that they said that because they were not learning about what they really were interested on. They used to go to dance class when what they really wanted to become after was a lawyer, or a doctor.

Other people believe that this will give students extra stress while they are thinking like an adult when they are in middle school. They believe that students are not old enough to decide what they really want, and that they might change their mind later. This people think that the best age for choosing a career is when the students have already graduated from high school.

In conclusion I believe that this idea that the new society wants to implant to the students is good, because students should take high school seriously, they are super close to become adults and they will have to decide what they want to do with their life, and as sooner as they decide the most beneficial for them it will be.

AA8DA5629CBC,"Why is it good to have a good attitude even if you have a difficult time? When you have a job you cant go to work with a bad attitude people will never come back. In the other hand good attitude make people want to come back and take to you. Even if you have a difficult time at less show a smile for other people to see that can make them feel good,and that might even make you feel batter.

There are many successes people out who had a hard time and that made them feel down and be sad but that did not stop them from working hard and have a good attitude to other people. For example,one day i had a very bad day when i was outside,then this very nice old man came bye me smiled and waved is hand and i did the same thing and that made me in a good attitude this is way when you see someone who is not feeling good go and take to him.

In a other hand,my bother had a bed day in school so we were going home in till we seen a very old Lady sharing to cross the rode, but she cant so we want to help her, and she told us some positively words and that made my day and his. when you help other people or even show a smile or do something that will make someone be in a good attitude is thee bast thing that will make you feel good and them two.

When you show a good attitude when you are having a difficult time the makes you a patter person,and everyone will love you,but when you are showing a bad attitude no one will like you. For example when i was waling to school this kid comes up to me and start saying words that made me mad and i had a difficult day,but i still showed good attitude to my people.

when you have a good attitude,during a difficult time is a good thing people will learn from you people will was you as in example you will make new friends,will have a good job in life people will respect you even if your mad dont show it and make people mad and spread nigtivety all round just smile and make people feel good and if you have a bad day at dose not mane you have to make other people made with your attitude.

AB75D2DC92B7,"Schools were made for people who wants to learn and be a successful person in life even though , there are some people who don't have the opportunity to be in school. Right now in some countries be on school until you are 18 is a law but it other countries government those not care about children future. Here in the United States they have the option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. They have that option specially on universities because some universities are out of the city and a percentage of students with a bad economy may not be viable to get transportation everyday. So In my opinion that is a great idea to have that option on universities. They should have the same option in high school but not to all the students because that may cause students to fail the classes. High school 's should give that option to students with excellent notes and for students who live out of town. Attend classes from home by online or videos has benefits, oneis you become more responsible,

second it helps you to earned money, and gives you more opportunities to success.

In one hand,Attend classes from home it may be a big responsibility because you are doing it by your own no one is going to help you or push you to learn. For example when you attend to class in a school or colleague there is always a teacher ,who is there to help you,supports you ,and make sure you don't fail your semester, they also make sure that you are learning and getting better everyday. Instead when you have to attend classes by yourself you must be confident and responsible to make sure that you are going to take classes everyday and don't waste the opportunity,because no one is going to be telling you more than 3threet times to do you work .There are some students that don't know what be a responsible person means, does students may not be viable to get good greats by taking classes from home. This kind of students need help from someone to push them and teach them to be a responsible person. Be a responsible person is important because it helps you to success in life gives more opportunities and you don't depend from nobody you learn how to do things by your own.

In the other hand one more benefit to attend classes by home in online it helps you to earn money specially if you live in large distance from school. A few houses are located miles away from the city that means schools are located miles a way from home. In that case attend classes from school it would be very helpful and a big opportunity. Because take transportation everyday Monday to Friday it may be expense because you may pay at mornings to get to school and pay back in the afternoon to go back home. One more benefit is that it help you to success,you may be a viable to find a job. For example you can do your online classes in the mornings and find a part-time in the afternoon. Many students do this they go to school on mornings and work for a couples of hours at night. But if you could attend classes from home it would be so much easier to work and study at the same time you would made your own schedule withou a problem. Also make sure to give enough of time to do your online classes and get good greats.

In conclusion

I do believe this potion to attend classes from home in online or videos is a great opportunity. Specially for students who live out of the city and for everyone who was to success in life no matter what. School and universities should let students know about this option. I am agree and I believe that I may not be the only one who support this idea. Therefore this opportunity should give to students who really needs it and no to those who would waste it .This kind of option should be in all over the world to help people with bad economy and help those who want to success and have a passion to learn. Students who have the opportunity to attend school everyday without a problem should know that there is people that live far from the city that they would love to be seated in a classroom and attend school everyday.

AB86BAABBF68,"It's a good idea for students to graduate of three years of high school instead of taking for years, i think if they have already passed their classes then they would not have to take elective classes and they might be able to graduate early, but if they need more then seven classes then they might do not be able to graduate and they will have to come during summer to complete their classes that they need to pass.

For example if they are still missing some of the work they had to complete at the end of the year they would have to come during summer school or maybe take more classes then what they were allow to be taking.

If they need to complete more work they might come during summer break, i think it would be good if you have all your classes that you need in order to graduate since when you come to ninth grade, so at the end of high school you might just come to skool just for maybe two classes and it would be better for you becase you need to pass all your classes either way in order to graduate.

and you are assigned with seven SOL and one for english actually you have to be able to pass all the work that youre assigned you must complete all these before you go to the 12th grade, because if you dont complete these assignments before thatnthen you will strugle with these at the end of the senior year of high school, but if you complete all your work that means that you are ready to graduate.

For example i am taking four classes that i need to graduate, but i am taking three elective classes because i wanted to learn more, and i did not want to go home early, so i told my counselour i wanted to get three more classes, but it is because i took all the classes i needed to take during the freshman, sophomore and junior year, so now that i am in twelve grade i just have to take just four main classes with are the ones i need in order to graduate.

Even tho it would have been a good idea to come in summer because i can learn more, but also would not be a good idea because then i would not be able to graduate on time, or mostly like i would have to come to turn in the work i did not finish during school year, and that would b bad because i want to graduate on time just like the other people that passed all theur classes so i need to put that effort and see or talk with the teacher and ask them what do ni need in order to pass all my classes if i am missing some work i have to turn it in.

I want to complete all the work due on time because if i do not turn in the work i am assigned to do then that would affect my grades and that will take me away from graduation, wich i have been waiting for since ninth grade,

So i think it is good to complete your work in class, or if you have homework assigned then we must complete it, or like sometimes the teachers put some work in google classroom with dates due, so we must turn the work on time and complete all of it, becase if we do not do it our grades are going to go down and that means we will not be passing the classes that we need to pass and that will not let us walk in the stage

We must complete all the work, if we do complete all that is assigned then we will be good and would not have to worry about our grades because the grades will be good too, that is why i say that we need to complete the work and sometimes pay attention to what the teacher is explaining that helps us to understand and make the work easy, but if we do not pay attention, at the end of the day or at the end of the class we will have problems with the understanding of the theme we have studied in class because we did not pay attention in class while the teacher was explaining.

One of the examples of not paying attention in class is, what is going to come next like we are going to get very bad grades, so we must do all the work listen while someone is giving instructions because that way we would not have problems with anything and when the test comes up we are going to be prepared to take it and get high grades, because we already studied and if we review our work before we turn it in and make sure everything is good and in order so we would get a good grades.

So other reason why we get good grades is if we come to school everyday because if we miss more then ten days we will get suspended and that will mess up your grades because you are abnsent and you will not be able to see or work in the class wich is better because if you do not come to school for couple of weeks then you will not know when you come back to school, you will be lost because you have already missed some of the work we already did while you was not here, so for me i rather coming to shool even though i am sick or something because otherwise i will bring my grades down and one missing day of school will make all my work come down or bring all my classes down because i have been absent and when i come back to school i would not know what to do.

It is good to keep your grades up and stay them in the same level because that will help ypu tp graduate, so one of my examples is if i come to school and complete all my work, then i do not have to worry about my grades, but ut is not only about your grades or what you do in class is also about what we get in the test and that will be product of the work and effort we put in class if we did good in our notes or study guides that means we will be great in the test too because it is the same that we learn in class it is all the same what will come in the test, so we need to stay focused and ask for help the teacher if we do not understand what we are doing in class.

The teachers are able to help in anything we want, well if it is about the classwork because sometimes we do not understand at all but we can review work and try the best for the next class, we always need to make sure our work is complete before we turn it in because if you have a small mistake that will bring your grades down too and we will not pass our classes and make sure complete everything, in order to graduate.",3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0
AB9527C4A312,"Technology have the limitation of human contract is due to use of technology had positive or negative effects on peoples's lives. Humans use the technology for some different's things,on this times technology is almost everywhere. If the technology did not exist we cant had more opportunities for learned more things for our life. Also,the people don't need to see face to face for had a conversation, because the technology are very advance that if you only cant had a phone you can communicate for text with people in other continents or countries. technology make all more easy than can be. i think that the technology can be affect in a positive way .For that a have some examples:

Technology is used for many things on humans life that make that the technology had a positive effect. For example,for some people the technology is their work they don't need to ask to nobody if they had a question about something ,if they did not had technology they can work and they can had money for live. Also,on the schools teachers and students need to use the technology,most of the time the students do their works on computers and they need to turned in by way of

Internet and if they had a question about something they can found on internet,on the schools is very important the technology they use for many things,on the schools of united states students and teachers use to do their works like 50% of technology they use more the technology for found information and they don't use a lot of books .In other way one part of the most people that use the technology is the doctors. They had a lot of technology devices,they use that for help people,the most part are for do operations that help them to safe more life than the pass times they now trust more on the technology that the books. However technology is use a lot on fabrics and that make that the people don't work hard like on fabrics that need to packed the technology is the that make more the work than the people.

Humans can use technology to do good or bad things. For example,with the time the people begin to learned little by little on how can they use the technology. The most part of people use the technology to do good things,like for their works like secretaries,teachers,doctors,and another works that use technology to communicate or safe things .Other people use the technology for teach to the children,in the Latin countries some parents begin to call the technology the new babysitter, for the reason that the technology like the phone, tablets , etc and more things like them are one of the ways more easy for distracting the children when their moms need to do or make somethings they use the technology and they don't need to other persons be with your children for distracting .Other people don't had good things on how can they use the technology and they learned how use however they use to defraud or search people on their social media they communicate a lot with the people. Some times they use to sequester people or to rob other peoples bank accounts. In some times is a lot of cases where the old people treated of fraud the children between the technology,like the socials media or online games they use to communicate in a bad way .In this case a lot of people death,in other are to use the technology on a bad way is when people want to be a hacker and they don't care to who they go to steal their accounts, in most of the case they steal banks accounts and use a lot of technology for that . that make me thing that if we had more opportunities to use the technology not all people think on good ways to use.

Technology can change the way of people live and think. for example. On one part the technology can do that the people feel safety of how their live in a good way on their house because the technology is more advanced and their create many things for people can be safe. Also, the technology make that the people that like to express on public can had a work in the social medias and show the their like to do like the youtubers they dont know who are washing then but they always talk like their know who see. the technology change the form of think of the old people because their in the pass time they need to write letters but now they can send a text or do a video call they dont need to be face to face . the limitation of the communications it is okay if you don see the person for talk. and if you are with your friends on one online game you need to had communication with him and you can talk face to face because he live in the other part of the world you can talk between the technology that make that the technology had a positive effect on the limitation.

Conclusion, some times the limitation of the human contact had a negative effect. For example, when you are in your work you need to have communication with your companion of work because you need to had a good relation with him. Also,if you are in a relationship with someone you can't communicate with him or her only for text you need to talk with your partner for had a good contact each other. However if you see the things for other way like when you are in the schools you need to found a answer and you do trust on that you classmate said you can discuss with other people by technology or search for that. on the conclusion for all my examples i think that no matter what if we had or not had human contact because both had positives an negatives effects. sometimes humans prefer technology more than books for search something because that are Lacy and don't want to read and the technology no always give to us good answers. But in limitation i think we need to had more human communication that technology communication.",2.5,2.5,3.5,2.0,2.0,3.0
ABBA50242CFA,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. That might a good idea for some students but not all. Today, many High Schoolers from the age of 15 to 18 have jobs. They work part time to help their parents pay for their phone bills, cars or something else. Sometimes they might want to work more, but school is 5 days a week, they have to do homework every night even on weekends. Going to work after school is very overwhelming. They get out at 9 or 10 depends on where they work, go home and do their homework, then go to bed probably late, and have to get up early the next morning. That goes on days after days. Many students can get stressed out easily. So I think attending classes online or video conferencing help lots of students who have jobs. Staying at home and study is still better than waking up and getting ready early in the morning to go to school. That might not be a big problem in summer or spring. But winter is the worst time of the year for students. The sun rises later than usually and sets earlier. It gets really cold and there is frozen ice on streets. Nobody wants to get up early and go to school or work when the sun hasn't even risen and frezzing weather outside. Of course they want to wrap around in their blankets and sleep in. But in the other hand, attending to school directly is better for some students. Leaning and teaching face to face is always easier than online. You could ask the teachers directly if you don't understand, and I think the teachers would be teaching and explaining in a better way face to face. Plus, you can meet new friends, socialize and participate in sports or any activities at school. So in the bottom line. I think it's better to combine both ways. The students can attend school everyday, except for snow days. They can take classes online since they can't make it to school. Cut the students some slack on some Fridays. They can stay home and attend classes online. Or only apply on seniors. Because it's their last year and they have lots of work to do. But in my opinion. Attending clases online or directly at school don't matter. What matters is that the students find their best ways to learn and relieve stress.          ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0
AC3111702C95,"First impressions are always important and can really effect how you are looked at but they are not impossible to change. They impact whether you get the job, make that friend or even if you get service if you are somewhere. I believe that first impressions are not impossible to change, they are hard but not impossible. Firstly, because someone could always forget, people can change, and you could receive a second chance to redeem yourself.

I have met people a second time that either I had a bad first impression with or they did and we forgot all about it. When you forget about somebody, the first impression with obviously not matter. You will forgive and forget. Also when I say the word ""forget,"" I do not mean completely lose all knowledge of the other person, but I mean maybe you did not care or maybe the first impression was not terrible that it was easy to block from your memory.

I have changed and many people in my life have also changed. Your first impression or somebody else's first impression might change if you meet them again in five to ten years. Over a period of time if let's say somebody who had a bad job interview wants to change and really wants the job, they will change and they will ask for another opportunity. Even if you have a bad encounter with someone the five times you have met them, your opinion about them will change with just one good impression. People change and when they do, so do impressions.

Second chances are also very important with impressions. Redeeming themselves is something a lot of people tend to do. Chances are not hard to ask for, and when making it up to somebody for a bad impression, you need to make it count. I have asked several people for second chances to redeem myself for bad impressions and now, we are friends. When I first applied to my first job, I was late to my interview and that is why I did not get the job. Then I asked my boss for a second chance, he gave it to me and now I have an amazing job.

In conclusion, no, first impressions are not impossible to change because there is forgetful people, people change and second chances exist. It is not hard to be on your best behavior or to be well dressed when meeting someone new, especially if they are of higher authority. First impressions are not impossible but are difficult to change, that is why it is good to try and make a good first impression to save you from trouble.",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5
AC9719A6A375,"is setting a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people i agree that setting a good example by your behavior is the best way to influence people when giving a good example your trying to influence and direct the people so you must have a good behavior in order for them to be persuaded, you must also have good details to provide to the people or your clients,and good examples can guide you to next step or level.

when setting a good example for other people you want them to be to be persuaded, and to follow the example. so you must have a good attitude and a good behavior. when providing a information to other people you have to make sure that what your saying make sense and its accurate. i have a little brother that wants to play basketball just like me, every game i have he come and watches me play, the moves he see me do in the game, if he likes it hes gonna tell me and when i get home i show him the examples on how to do those specific moves. when you show good examples people will folow and will be pass those examples down to somone else.

good examples can guide you, to the next step or level. when i'm taking a test at school, it always begins with a three question example and it lets me know what i am going to be dealing with, so when I take the test i know what i am going to be expecting on the test ,and i am also gonna know what to do on the test. examples can help a lot of people succeed. when your working on any school work or classwork it always starts with an examples on how to show you how to answer the problems and do it. little examples can provide people with a lot of information. if you pay attention to the examples it can really help you in the future. some lawyers use examples when talking to a judge in court to help them understand or to persuade them.

when providing information to other people you want to make sure your attitude and behavior is on point in order for them to listen. my parents sometimes have trouble using technology so when they need help i'm ready to show them examples on what they are having trouble on, they know they can always count on me,and that is the type of behavior if they ever need any help. a lot of people doesnt tolerate poor behavior. when my English teacher is giving the class an example on what we are going to do later that day she makes sure that each and one of his understands what we are doing before she moves on. the source that your providing you have to make sure it actually or if it can other people out.

although some people may say giving a example with your own behavior may not work for a lot of people. another way you can show an example, is by showing them in person. I sometimes have trouble making or creating something so i got to watch someone else do it in order for me to do it. showing direction to people in person will make it somewhat easier for the the person to understand,instead of just telling them. you can influence other upon your action and they might follow id your attitude is good.

First, the students has more distraction in home; with vedeo play, and othe oction, more students work a time with taking a class, more with have a classes in distance, the schools need a tanking a other options. With lern in school the students are more specific learn, with a have a teacher opposite the student to learnig more specific, when she tanking the classes to has a more effective for a students.

Second, I hink this option for learning offer the class in distance wich a attend classes from home; not is a good option for example: in my house a have three brothers, and one sister, I think is distraction wich learning in home.

In finally; with reason with not is good idea the learning a distance the school, I think is more elementary, basic to taking the video conferencing online, because; learning more in the watch the vedeo conference, with online; is more effective memorize with the morning in not in evening, the students have forceful in the morning, but no think this is a good option for a students, not have a good benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

ACB4771E367E,"Imagine living an outgoing life or a lazy life. It's like talking about a traveler and a video game addict. In my opinion I think we do accomplish more if we are always doing something because when you are out doing something you gain experience, also when your out doing something you tend to meet new people, even though some would argue that living a inactivity life also serves a purpose because inactivity allows you to live a life closer with your family.

First when your out doing something you gain experience. In my opinion when your constantly out you gain social experience. For example you wont be as shy to speak to others, and you wont be awkward when socializing. Also, when your out you are traveling and getting to understand and appreciate many different cultures around the world. Another example you get a closer look into the lives of everyone around the world and allows you to help them get through any hurdles. These are some reasons on why gaining experience and understanding others is important.

Also when your out doing something you meet new people. For example your always talking to people when your out so you tend on making new friends. When your traveling and in need of a place to stay, by making new friends around the world you are possibly covered and dont have to spend a dime on a hotel. Another example when your out doing something you can possibly meet the right one, future (Husband/Wife). I've seen many stories of people traveling doing something and they end up falling in love with someone. This is why meeting new people by doing something is a good thing.

Some would argue that living an inactivity life serves purpose. For example you get to sit around and just hang out. Also you can make friends and do many things through the online world. Sure all these things are good you get to have a different form of fun. However you're just being plain lazy and choosing the simple way of living. Also once you have to go out into the real world you'll most likely be awkward and shy. This is why being inactive can be some what good but also bad.

In conclusion being able to travel and get to understand different cultures also gain experience is super fun. Also having friends from all around the world is just so cool and brings many different kinds of stories to the table. Even though living an inactivity life has it's flaws it also has it's pros theres so many different opportunities but your not living a fulfilled life. In my opinion we do accomplish a lot more in life being active and going out doing something than being at home being lazy not doing anything. This is everything on why I think we accomplish more by being active.  ",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5
AD175892EC1C,"Attending school and Attending online classes.

Attending classes from home by the way of online or video conferencing is not a really smart idea. You can learn better by making eye contact, and asking questions from the teacher rather, than just trying to learn online. Education is one of the most important things in our life that we can't continue it in a good way by attending online classes. Attending online classes might look a smart idea for some learners because they might be able to stay home, and study, but there is absolutely a reason that we build schools. Students might get benifts by attending online classes, but not as they will by going to school. Attending school instead of attending online classes have a lot of benefits that can change an idea of attending online classes.

Attending school can give us a freindly character by being able to talk in front of a group of people. When we attend school, we start talking, and communicating with people by the time we get in the bus. We can find freinds, and get help from them when we need. We will be able to ask any question from the teacher at any time that we want, and they can give us the answer without waiting or searching it online. We will get ready for bigger communities such as college and university by attending school. Teachers don't just teach us a lesson, but they show us how to talk in a good way, and how to have a good character in our life. which online classes would't help us in such a way. We will have a lot of events at school that we can celebrate with the whole school. We can't celebrate any event while attending online classes.

Our chatacter, and the way we are is really important, and attending school will help us to have them in a best way. Talking, and asking questions in front of the whole class or several classes will help us a lot to get ready for college, and more other presentations. Comunicating is something that we will need to use in every day of our life. School is the best way to learn how to comunicate. When we go to college or university there will be a community bigger than a school. Therefore, attending school is a very good option rather than attending online classes. School is not just a place to study books, but its a place where we learn how to live like an educated human. Friends are like family. while we are attending school we will make a lot of freinds but we can't make any freind while attending online classes. Celebrating some events will give us the best memory while we can have that by attending school but not online classes.

Attending online classes have a lot of disabilities to teach a student they way they need to be teaching. A teacher can show us how to use a good language with other people but an online class wouldn't be able to do that. A big community like school can make us get used to talk in front of a group of people, while in online classes we are alone. We need courage in order to study. When we answer a question in the class or get a good grade in our class, the teacher, and students courage us but if we get a good grade in online class, there is no one to see our talent and courage us wihtout a small class massege. Attending online class might be good for some reasons. When we are sick or we have a poblem that we can't go to school; attending online class will help us, but not for a long time. Video conferencig has a big different with wactching what the teacher does in class, and what questions students ask.

There is a lot of ways that we can study but, attending school is the best way. Attending school is a complete education than other ways. we build schools because we can understand the importance of studying at school. School is a place where we start how to to earn someting that we want, and teachers help us with that by giving us courage. Attending online classes will just help us read something, and if we don't understand a word, then we need to search online for that either, whcih is going to take longer time than studying at school. I strongly prefer attending school than attending online classes because there are many benifits we can get by attenidg school rather than attending online classes. We can not learn all the good things on online classes that we can by attending school. Attending online classes will be a big process, diffuicult, less apportunties, and there is no one to encourage us or show us what is good for us. Attending school is a best way to have a bright future, a good way to communicate and a good preperation for college and bigger communities.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0
AD5621D2A958,"First impressions will always change bceuase you dont know the persons true color's yet. A lot of people act so nice on there job interview, but later on that first impression is going to change. On the first day of school teacher's act to nice but, later on in the school year the teahcer's first impression is going to change.

For example, when you first meet the person they act so friendly and so nice until you really get to know them, they start changing. you will see the persons true colors if they act the same and do what they first did when you met them. Finally, first impressions going to change because some people just act to do good on thier first impression.

For example, people dress and act good at there job interview. When they finally get that job, first impression is going to change because they are going to keep calling off and not work hard enough as they said in the interview. Finally, when the manager see's that you changed your first impression you will get fired.

AD6986B56719,"Michelangelo once said ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" I agree with this because we should never set our standards low even if it means we will reach our goal quicker; we should always have a strong mindset in completing and tackling hard tasks no matter how hard it can be. This can be mentally be difficult for some people because they like to quit when something is too hard for them, this shows how weak minded a person can be and end up never completing that achievement. If you're setting your achievement low knowing that you can complete it, why do it then? It will be a waist of time and you'll most likely get no satisfaction out of it.

Waking up in the morning and looking at your to do list and seeing that hard goal you have to complete can really throw off people. They look at it and starting off their morning can put them in a bad mood. This can mean that the person is not mentally strong enough to finish his or her task, it can take weeks, months, or even years; some people just dont have the patience for it. This most likely means that you'll never complete anything difficult in your life and end up always choosing an easy goal knowing you can complete it in a short amount of time, That type of mindset will never get you anywhere in life, no one will want a lazy person working for them in the future; they'll want a hard working and determined individual.

A person should always set a task for them that is hard, but something they know they can complete. This can be working overtime at your job for that sports car you've always wanted or even just saving up money for retirement. Setting your goal low can mean the person will never grow up to be a strong individual or even be a hard worker. After completing your goal you should always get lots of joy, happiness, and satisfaction; if you're not getting any of those you're doing something wrong. It should never feel like your goal was just a waist of time or you did this for nothing, you should come out of your goal as a stronger and happier person.

Having a negative attitude can play huge role in why you're not completing hard goals. Two keys factors in completing a hard task are having the right mindset and having a positive attitude; Having neither of these will already be putting you in a major disadvantage. Through out your day you should always have a positive personalty, who would want to talk to an angry and negative person? These are very difficult skills to learn it takes patience and time, but already having these two key traits can put you in the biggest advantage for completing your hard task. Not lots of people embrace these because they think they are useless that it has nothing to do with your mind but more about the actions of the person.

In conclusion I highly agree with Michelangelo's statement, it can sometimes bring out the worst in us but that is how we grow and learn as a person. This quote separates the lazy week minded people out there from the hard working, strong minded, and positive people. Setting a hard task and taking the time to complete can influence yourself into completing harder goals you have planned for yourself in the future. This is how successful people are born and become who they are and make a name for them self, no millionaire would ever tell you to set your standards low just because you feel like you can't complete a hard goal; they would tell you to push yourself mentally and physically no matter what the cost may be. Some people are just born without that mentality that most successful people posses, you cant teach lazy but you most certainly can teach hard work, determination, striving, and dedication.",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5
AD730017246A,"Prime Minster Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" This quote indecteds that becoming successful is a lie in life that dose not have challenges,failures and have hard time in life to achive your goals and, without making it intersting. However, a lot of people belives this quote, because success is nothing with haveing enthusiasm and, lossing or being fail on something and being positive about it.

First, Haveing successful life without challenges is result of being fail in your success. The reason why you should have challenges in life to become a succesful its to make you a a better person in life and to make you a critical thinker and to garner your all skills and your talents for the better future. For example if you face your challenges later in life you would have the benfits from that hard or easy challenges.

secondly, makeing you challenigs intersting would led to be come successful, the reason why because having intersing and positive attuide towards your challengs would make it easire to handle. For example if your lossing a bussines or challnge do not bring nagitive atomsphere around it because it would never let your mind to have more oppotrunity that you could done more.

In my piont of view, failing or lossing is lie if you do not try hard for the intersting and successful goals. If you are lossing a challenge it okay to loss but with positive thought and never give up on the difficults challenge you have to face in you way to successful life and gaols. However a lot of people gives up on the diffecult challenges because its too hard for them to handle and at end they would have more diffcult thing to face.

ADFE2CDB6FF1,"Yes i think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home in the way that they can be more ready to start the class, and they will focus.

-The reason why i though that is because sometimes at school the students they have shame to show to other the best of them, "" the intelligent student told me that i can't do anything or i can't speak very well English"" still if we want make our goals we can do it. Without go to the school.

-For example:

If a student is on his house alone with no one told him what or how he need to do the correct things, but he has a lot of question about what he is doing in his online class. He will try to find the way to solve the problem by himself.

Also if i was in my home find new imformation and i work to much during the day then i would be hungry then i can go to the kitchen for cook something very fast and go back to my room continue with my homework. And if i have a question i will ask for help to some teacher by texting.

Eventually, attend classes at home with no pressure could made different and confortable for the students who are shy or maybe need a teacher only for one student for explain the class that the student is taking. Below for those students that don't like to wake up too early in the morningt they have the choose to study more later since at night without necesary be ready for school. Many cases when girls are pregnant they can still going at school, but it was diffult for them had to continue study and also after that they giving birth too. i know that because a friend told me and another girls too, she told us the process that she has to pass during her pregnancy and after when she has her baby with her I don't know how hard it is, but i can imagine in this position. So what my friend do? during her pregnancy she still coming to the school i saw her many time she was so tired with her belly and then when she has her baby yet she take in her house the next classes i was surprise about it either i do not how unconfortable it was for her that a teacher was with her when the baby start cry or when the baby need to eat, later she was done she back to the school but she didn't feel ok for leave her baby at home. This story make me think about it if i have the election to choose how i can study i prefer study and take the classes in my house better that school.

I think the students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home that's great idea. but there are many problems; what happen if the student do not have money to pay the online classes? either their families do not have the recourses for help them another reason that's why we have to work and make money for us and we missing many days in the school for stay at home because we want sleep more hours or we coming to the school and we are no pay attention what the teacher is talk about the class, So i think this if a student want money need to work and continue study online maybe in that way is more easy pass the class and the SOL. Attend classes from home by way online help this type of case the students go to work few hours and then coming home for the rest of the day to study or another option is one day work and the next day don't and stay at home taking the online classes, in summary ""NEVER GIVE UP"" when we want something that we can't get it in nowhere only in our effort we can make that possible. Also with some help ask when we do not understand something and put the best of us all including: try to solve the problems, research good imformation, and the most importat thing that we have to do is study. sometimes the other people make feel us so bad or without no reason to be in this world, go ahead and desmostrate to that person who do not believe in you that you can do it.

During school year is possible learning for online or video conferencing,in the videos explain clearly what or how to solve math ejercise or another kind of materials. Examples of benefit to attend classes at home are:

- Spend more time in the computer

- More focus in the homework

- Use the iphone for imformation whenever we want

- Study all the day

- No talk with your friends during your class

- Finish more fast with no distraction

All that things are benfit if the students being to attend classes in their home in the winter they don't have to worry about how cold is outside in the morning or what clothes is appropriate for school, and have to coming in the school in a good mood for study and see somebody that we do not want to see and prevent be involve in problems with another student. Could fine stay at home by self in own class than go to the school. Many student suffer of depreciation and that is so bad for them. If they school giving to them the opportunities to take the classes online it is more better for their healthy, this is my opinion about attend classes on the home.

Students would benefit from being able to attend a regular school because students will learn more if they go to a regular school and students can do more better or focus if they're in the regular class/school and they can ask for a help from their teacher or their classmate. The most important in a regular school is that you can ask your teacher face to face about your grade or your missing paper works on her/hes class. For example, Sarah is more likely to attend on a regular school more than an option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because Sarah is more having fun to go to a regular school to see her teacher, classmate, and her friends everyday.

After he got a driver's license, he can drive anywhere. He drives very well after he took the driving lesson.

Another example, Generic_Name wants to be a scientist. So, she is studying a science. Also, she is doing lab with the experiment materials in the laboratory. But, there are many hard science problems, and experiment materials. So, she wants to give up, and get another job that can do easy way. But, she decided to don't give up for her job. So, she didn't give up to be a scientist. She studied hard, and researched how to succeed in the experiment. After she did that, she got a job scientist.

AF83C17B5451,"In school there are a lot of fun and educational activities. One of my favorite activity to do in school is a science experiment. In science there are a lot of awesome experiments and tools you can use, and they are fun to use. If there wasn't any fun science experiments; I wouldn't like to go to science.

Some kids say that science is the worst subject in school and it is boring. In my opinion scinece has a lot of cool stuff that you can't do in any other fun activity in school. my most favorite experiment is when we are mixing chemicals because you don't have a major clue of what is going to happen when you mix them up, and that is what makes it interesting and fun at the sma time. There are more experiments that you do in science like making a volcano eruption or something else but science can be fun if you pay attention to what the teacher is saying and following the rules because there can be fun but there has to be rules or somebody can get hurt

In conclusion there might be some better educational activities but in my opinion i like more science experiments, however, it does get boring sometimes and you just don't want to do anything, therefor, you just can't complain about life, you just got to with it and enjoy it .",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0
B03AB7243AE5,"Millions of kids graduated last year when taking the program for early graduation, this program helps student to only take three years in high school. Most of the parents, students, and the teachers like to see students graduate early in high school, and this programs are mostly in the U.S.A. Student who graduated early will have a lot of opportunity to finish school and have a better life, most summer school lesson can also help students to take less classes at school. It is a good idea for student to take only three classes in high school in order to graduate and go to college, back those days my mom use to tell me a story, about the opportunities we have in we that most people don't really care about. She used to tell me a story about her in high school, how hard it is to graduate, most people can take five to six years in order to graduate and go to college. And most people did- en make it to college, cause they don't have the money to pay and it really hard to find a job in Africa. Student drop out of school just because they don't have the opportunity we have right now to graduate in high school. Most people will say it like this, ""Genius without education is like silver and mine"". People are brave, strong, smart, last learning, and well educated but they just don't use it and decided to let it go. This mostly happened to people who have the opportunity to do the right things but decided to let it go, and my gran mother use to tell me a story. If you ready to help yourself, God will be ready to help you, if you not trying to help yourself, God will not going to help you. All this opportunity we have are all helpful in many ways, taking three years in high school is very help full for most of the students, reasons why graduation early in high school is better than waiting for four years are.

first reason, the three years of high school helps student to graduate early and move on to the next level, helps student to finish school early and have a better life.

Second reason, helps students learn faster and makes it easier for college, it also helps student to take less classes in high school.

the last but not the least, summer school programs can help students understand better and easier than normal classes because, less distraction from other students and having opportunities to ask questions you don't understand.

Student must take this programs very security, so you will be able to graduate early in high school or a small leak can sink a great ship.  ",3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5
B2123357B114,"People have said ""positive attitude is the key to success in life"". I competely agree with the statement because the person would have a positive mindset even going through hard time in their life. They won't be giving up on their self. I belive without being positve a person would be depressed or being negative about their self.

I belive if you want to be successful in life you gotta belive in yourself. You gotta bring yourself up when feeling down. A negative attitude won't get you no where. I understand that sometime life problem can be difficult, but you gotta keep being positive. Don't let yourself get to a negstive stage beacuse you won't be anvoidable to accomplish your dream.

In life being a negavtive person isn't a good solution if you to be success in life. A person with a negative mindset would have bed thought in their mind. For example"" you can't do this"" or "" just give up on life"" . you won't have enough confidence to accomlished your goal. If you are a negative person then you should get some help or go talk to someone help. So, you can become a better positive person.

A positive attitude help you to be something in the future. It's give you happiness and make life easier. You won't be upset thinking "" did i do this right "" or "" am i good enough "". Also, with a psitive mindset you will want to keep trying unitl you make it. when you a positive person ; people would want to be around you.

B2DAE4CC6597,"Today schools offer many tools or ways to complete your diary learning process. one of these tool is called ""school at home"" or ""distance learning"". Basicaly students can complete all their schoolworks and learning process at home through different methods like, in this case, the students attend classes form home by way of online or video cinferencing, but is it really good for the students?. Probably not.

It is know that students learn how to be sociable at school, and also they learn how to act at to many different social events or situations in the daily life. For example, we have a group of students, they are all the day working in a classroom with other students and friends that they knew at school; and we have a group of students that take ""school at home "", they do their school work in their houses and they just can socialice with they family at home. How can you learn how to be sociable without socialice with new people? different than your family ?. The answer is: you can't. Talk with new people improve you confidence and helps you to make new friends, and as students or young people, we do not used to try to talk with new people, because we are afraid, we don't have self-confidence, etc. and school force us to be social with our partners.

Moreover, some people claim that school is not a good way to improve your social abilities, but that people passed and important point and is that the school is the best way to improve your social abilities. For example, you (as a student) are working from monday to friday at least six hours per day with other students and teachers in different classrooms, the students aren't going to be the same in each classroom. All these factors made you get used to different personalities or behaviors of your teachers, friends, and classmates. School have to many different people with different behaviors that can help you to understand the way that people act and how to be their friend.

In addition, school teaches you how is going to be your life when you grow up and trains you for that. There are to many similarities between school and a job, for example: the schedule that makes you get use to the early woke ups, the homeworks that make you understand how long can be a job journey, and the teachers and students that represents your boss ans partners at work. All these examples of how school trains us for our future. Without all the training that the schools gave us, it would be a problem to get use to or daily life when we grow up.

All these reasons show us that school will benefit students more than ""school at home"" or ""distance learning"", because it teach us how to be sociable, it develops or social abilities, and it is a necessary part of our training for our adult life. In conclusion, school trains us as people, it teach us how to socialice and work.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5
B37D0A9D7859,"Do you have a positive attitude? I agree with this statement about the importance of a positive attitude. Being positive is the key to being successful in life, I think having a positive mind can help us in our bad circumstances of life and help us overcome bad time faster. Having a positive attitude will give allow you to have a good days. Others may think you do not have to have a positive attitude in order to be successful.

Having a positive mindset will always help you get better opportunities, for example to get a better job or a better home or a better car, but everything requires that you have a positive mindset.

Also having a positive mind will always help you to be better every day every time you overcome a bad situation you will become stronger or also every time you reach a goal, that will help you be better.

Sometimes it is also necessary to be negative to understand or experience bad things or it can also help you be prepared for bad things, or also bad news or bad times. We have to try to be positive most of the time to be able to make good decisions and have better opportunities, but also being negative can help us make better decisions for ourselves.

Different from how I think, people say if you are smart, why do I need a positive attitude? They believe someone can be successful just knowing the skills. There are those that believe if, you work harden than most you can be successful.

In closing, it is my belief if you have a positive attitude you will have a successful and rewarding life. A positive mind will give you better opportunities, and great energy.

I think that we should have policy number one. All student should be ably to use there phones in their free time & in lunch. Its better to have them off in class time. Because if we don't then the student wouldn't learn. They should be turn off or it should be low. Some student would really like this idea about using phones in there free time. There some student who don't like to go to lunch or like to eat and by using there phone they have something to do. The teacher get mad when there standing up by having there phone i don't think they will be. Most kids use there phone in school when the teacher don't look so its better to have the rule about only in free time. By having this rule i think it will make kids be better because if there not then they will not be ably to use there phones. That what most kids like and want to be ably to use there phone in school. Not all kids have phones so to make it far for everyone the rule should be phones and ipods only in there free time .Think this would work good as a rule but we need to try it first. In high school you can use it so why not middle school. Kids should start see how it work with the phones in high school. So they can have in idea about it. But not everyone is going to think how i do but i think we should try it for a week or two to see if it works. But think that policy number one is a good one and a good idea.

We never now if we don't try. We should try if it work we keep it if it doesn't then we just say it didn't. But we can say at least we tried. For some student it will work good but for some it wont.

I think he is said is right you never give up on anything, you are always going to wings and sometimes you are going to fail. Because thats how you are going to wing never giving up. There is a lot of stuffs that I been done on my life, that now i start thinking i never finish what I start. But I dont give up i know I m going to end up doing them soon. for example there is a lot of people that have the motivation, then they start winning and fail ones and they give up. when you love something you gotta chases it because then you are never going have it.

Failure is a really strong word that nobody likes to like that hear some students get upset for failing a test or class they cant be late because they want to win is just like work if you want to start getting paid more you always gotta be on time and all that. so you can become better everyday. Soccer is one example about success soccer you got to learn a lot of new stuffs, Because you have to do a lot of practice. To win you gotta do something,and do it right all time. We all hate failing I hate failing, I always think that is just a waste of time. I fail so many times but i never give up because I know that I gotta finish what I started ow you are going to success

Enthusiasm thats whats the way to success on your dreams if never use that enthusiasm to do something you are going to be good at it you might fail more than ones but still think about what is going to give you.

B6B85CE5C8F5,"When it comes to trying to be someone, is it better to improvise or follow the script all the time?

Everyone needs to have their own individuality and be original instead of trying to be something else because that way you learn more about yourself. Also, you are acknowledging different methods about how to be better than yourself. And one of the most important things, you could make a good influence in someone else's life and teach him/her how to find their path in their own way. No matter what happens, you always have to follow yourself.

When you learn more about yourself it means that you do not just learn things that you already know about yourself, you also learn new things that you did not know about yourself. For example, one day you are going to the basement of your house which is really big and put some good music. While you are listening to your favorite songs from your playlist, you are dancing according to the tempo and doing the dancing moves that you usually do. After dancing for a long while, suddenly you let the music take control over you and you make a back flip without practicing it before. You are very surprised because you did something that you did not know you could do and after that, you keep practicing that move and perfectioning it and it comes out natural. That is how you learn more about yourself.

You are acknowledging different methods to be better than yourself. This means you will do whatever is right in order to become a better person. For example, Robert Downey Jr used to have a terrible life by consuming drugs and other things that got him in trouble with the law. He even went to court for all the messy things he did. After a long time taking bad decisions, he finally decided to make things better for the people who cares about him and specially for him. It took him over 5 years for him to get back on his feet; with his own effort and the support from his family and friends, he started to make a good difference for the world. Right now, Robert is one the best actors in Hollywood, he has an excellent life with his wife and kids on his side, and is a great influence for millions of people. That is how you acknowledge different methods to be better that yourself.

Some people say that you are copying someone else when you try to be yourself. However, they are wrong because you actually are listening to those tips that you have heard and following them under your own perspective. That way you are definitely writing your own script but at the same time, giving the deserved credit to the person who gave you those tips. For instance, when you are trying to get a girl that you met in a party but you have no idea of what to do in order to get her attention. You ask your friend for some advice to accomplish your goal so you do not go through a bad experience. He tells you what to do exactly and shows you with some women at the party and now you have some ideas of what you can do. So before you reach out to that girl, your friend tells you ""be yourself all the time"" and you get the courage to talk to her. After following those examples in your own way, the girl started to have deep feelings for you and everything worked out a lot well and make some influence to some of your friends who need that kind of help. That is how you follow your own script with your own terms.

In conclusion, it is very important that you have be yourself all the time because it shows that you do not need somebody in order to be somebody. You learn about yourself so you can get to know your own person more than you can know about an anime character. You acknowledge new ways to become better than yourself like if you were in a videogame, you are going to the next level slowly. You make a good influence by doing things as right as possible and you give people some benefits out of it. To be yourself you have to do what your gut tells you to do if you think it is going to give some benefits in some way.",3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

Although some people might think that taking online or video conferencing class can be helpful because student can get a lot of sleep before starting the class and the student will be the one to choose the time he or she wish to take the class or watch the video conferencing.

firstly why I don't agree with the idea of taking home school or watch video conferencing is because student find home school to be boring and they can't focus in the teaching of the video conferencing. like for example if the person who is teaching in the video speaks softly it will make that student feel sleeping and by the time he or she get up the video might be finish at the end of the day the student don't gained anything from the online teaching, and other student will turn on the video and still be charting with their friends on the phone while the video is playing, he or she will not focus on the video that is teaching.

secondly why I said home schooling or video conferencing can't be beneficial for student is because student will find it very hard to understand the teaching of the video conferencing or the home schooling. like if the video is playing but the student don't understand the teaching of the video he or she can't get the chance to ask question about what they don't understand .And some of this video teaching sometime is really confusing the student that why other student prefer to set in class while teaching so that if he or she don't understand they can ask question about the topic. other student have their young ones at home while he or she want to listen to the teaching their young ones will be make noise so they can't get what the video is teaching about and that will make them not to understand the teaching.

I am not in favor of the idea of student taking online classes because they will find it very boring which they can't focus on the teaching and it will very hard for them to understand the teaching of the video.

B948405746B5,"Many students like to spend time with their friends in the school. Specially high schools are good places for students to learn and get fun with their friends. By the way some students are coming to school just for the pass their classes and work hard to graduate with high grades. I think graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years from a high school would be good for these students. Because they can go to college/university early, or work 1 year full time in a job to save money after graduated from high school or get more time to think about their career desicion.

First of all a student who graduated from high school in three years can attend to a college early. This means this student also can graduate one year early from the college and start his career early. If this student already decided to which college or university that he wants to go and what career he wants to do, this can be good for him. Also, student can understand how college classes are.

Second reason for to choose graduate early is save money for college/university. Some students who graduated from high school don't go to college/university directly. These students choose to work in a job one or two years full time to save money for college/university. This is a good option for the students who doesn't have money to pay for college/university or who doesn't want to be dependent to his family. Some families don't have money to pay their childrens' school. In this kind of situations students choose to wait one or two years instead of go to college/university directly.

Another reason to graduate early from high school is to get a extra year to make a desicion about career and college/university. Some students think it is hard to choose the right career for them in high school because when they graduateded from university their careers is going to be their whole life. Like an example sometimes students choose the job according to the classes that they liked in their high school but after they go to college/university they understand this career is not interesting more to them. According to the scientistists 35% of the college/university students decide to change their career in their freshman or sophomore year in the university. This shows that students need to think carefully while they make a decision about their careers. Also the career that a student choose effects the college/university that he wants to go because many students choose the university that gives good education and opportunites to this students about their careers that they choosed.

In conclusion I think graduate one year early from high school is a good idea for the students who wants to go to college/university early. Another reason is save money to pay college/university and final reason is to get a extra time to make a desicion about right career and school. I believe also to study and get prepared better for SAT

to get a higher score can be an extra reason. Graduate early from high school is a good idea but also can be hard for all students. So, student who wants to graduate early from high school needs to work hard.",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,2.5,3.0

How could older students help younger students with school work. Older students are smarter then younger students, whereas younger students could learn faster then older students. My older sister is really smart every time I ask for help she always helps me and she shows me how to solve the problems that I dont understand. After she shows me how to solve the problem I would understand the question and solve the other problems. That is how older students could help younger students with their work.

When older and younger students work as a team it could benefit them both with their team work and their project that they are working on together. One time I had to work with an older students with this project that I had to do. They were such a great help and they showed me how to start it and how to end it. They were so intelligent and they would tell me if I had done something wrong and how I should correct it. That is how older and younger students could learn more about team work together.

Older and younger students learning viable things and give each other great advice when one needs it. When I was in third grade I was going to have my first SOL, I was so nervous and scared about it. But then my older brother gave me great advice and that I should calm down and focus on it. He helped me to study for and he was a really big help. That is why older students can give you really good advice when you need it, and younger students too can give great advice.

Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for education purpose. Many people say cellphones is a great tool for specific things, such as something you may want to know or something you do not know. In my opinion cell phones should not be allow to used it the classroom because students use cellphones all day and do no pay attention, cellphones it can be used for other things, and cellphones distract you.

The students use the cellphones all day and do not pay any attention during class is really bad for students because, they come to school to learn and not be in their cellphones. For example, cellphones it may help you to look for something you might want to know, but when the test and quizzes comes students are not going to know anything because students did not pay attention for being in their cellphones the hall day doing nothing.

Cellphone it can be used for other things, for text with friends or, play games during classes, for watch videos during class, listen to music and not listening on what the teacher is saying. Also students use cellphones to take videos, or photos that they want to search in their social media or just for have fun. For example some students likes to take photos of someone just for have fun or just for bully them in their social media.

Some people say cellphones is a tool to do homework, project, or something you want to do in your cellphone, or when you are confused with something, however cellphones distract you to do those kind of stuff, such as being at your apps and not doing what you suppose to be doing while because you are texting or face timing someone and you get distract and you forgot about to finish your homework or classwork that the teacher have signed you to do,and your grades might go down into a zero if your keep distracting yourself being in you phone during class time.

In conclusion some schools use cell phones in their classroom for educational purpose. Cellphones should not be allow during classroom for educational purposes because students would not learn anything if they are in theirs cellphones during classroom , we know that every student love being in their cellphone during the day, but cellphones will not help student in their educational purposes, and cellphones are not gonna help you learn what you need to learn during students school education.

BDA166D1989A,"The famous artist Michelangelo once said, ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" His quote implies that completing a low goal is far worse that failure. In my opinion, I agree with Michelangelo's quote; when people aim too low, they are preventing themselves to have learning experiences. In order for growth and improvement, one must be required to step out off their comfort zone. Because aiming high comes with better resluts, it can serve as motivation to completing a goal. Although one may fail while aiming high, you will gain experience and knowledge from the situation.

To begin with, growth comes with attempting to accomplish new things out of your comfort zone. While always staying in your comfort zone, aiming low, you will be confining yourself, which prevents you from improvement. When you set your aim high, it assists with finding out what you are truly capable of. For instance, when working towards a goal, it comes with finding your true self. You can learn about your interests and hobbies, or even new ideas and thoughts that come to mind. When setting you aim high, it improves you as a person and helps with your own growth.

Not to mention, aiming high for a goal is possible when you have the right mentality.

When you aim high, the results are more motivating than when going for a goal set low. For instance, when achieving to graduate high school, one may aim to graduate as valedictorian. Being the valedictorian comes with great results such as getting into a better college or even just feeling better about yourself. If you put your mind to it, belive in yourself, and work hard towards it you will be able to accomplish any goal.

Furthermore, failing at achieving a goal provides experience. When you fail, you can use that situation to understand where you went wrong. In order to succeed the next time you attempt again, you can improve your mistakes. Failing is essential to the learning process as it gives you a chance to better yourself to prevent future mistakes. This knowledge you have accumulated from this certain situation, will be useful if applied to other life problems. On the other hand, when you aim for a low mark, there is no learning lesson you may gain.

However, some people believe nothing is wrong with setting your aim low. Instead, they believe that going for a goal set too high is worse as it means it will come with failure. These people view failing as a discouragement as others may consider them as a weak.

However, aiming high and failing gives you a life-longing experience by having the chance to improve your mistakes. When attempting again, you will have gained the knowledge to do so.

In conclusion, I believe that setting our aim too low and achieving it is far worse than aiming high and failing. For the fact that we need to grow as a person, we can not always stay in our comfort zone. By setting goals too low, we are preventing ourselves to grow and improve. By setting goals to a higher level, we can gain experience and knowledge that comes with the path to achievement. ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5

One of the reasons why seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because when you ask more than one people for advice, they mostly give you different ideas and the more ideas you get from people the easier it feels to make that choice. Another reason why seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is that when you ask different people for advice they would give you their own opinions about that choice. For example, if you ask your friend for advice for a choice you are going to make, that friend might tell you something positive about it, in the other hand, if you ask another friend for advice for a choice they might tell you something bad about it which will be way different than what your other friend said. The third reason why I think seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because if one person told you a negative advise and the other person told you a positive advise, you could pick which one you think is helpful. The fourth reason why I think seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because if you ask a friend for advice they can tell you their personal thoughts about that choice and if you ask another person they might give you their personal thoughts about it.

First I would visit the Eiffel tower with my friends.

The amazing height of the Eiffel tower. When we were walking to go see the Eiffel tower, it didn't seem big, but when we got closer, it seemed huge, I was shocked because I never knew that it was very huge. Then on the top of the Eiffel Tower, the city can be seen. As we were on the top of the Eiffel tower I could not believe that I could see the beautiful view of the lights of the city. Finally we took pictures of the the beautiful surroundings of the Tower. My friends were very happy when we got to the ground, so we decided to take pictures, they had a big smile on their face as we took the pictures, the place was beautiful, we walked all over the place, and took a bunch of picture with the Eiffel tower, and where it was located. Visiting the Eiffel tower was a very exiting experience for me, and my friends, we got to see the view of the Eiffel Tower.

Second we can experience the life of the other people that live in Generic_City.

Meeting new people in the park is very exiting for me and my Friends. When my friends and I went out for a walk on the morning, we walked by the park. My friends spotted a groups of friends that were walking in our direction, they introduced themselves and we did too, we told them that we were visiting here, and they were so nice, and we started chatting. Then we experienced their food, and the Restaurant that Generic_Name and his friends like to go to. Generic_Name was a very special person, he invite us with him and his friends to the restaurant. When we were walking to the restaurants that they were taking us to, I could already smell the delicious smell of the food of the Restaurant.

I dont know why people dont accomplish something in life. People always says that things happen for a reason. There could be reasons of why things happen or not. In my opinion, people should always by doing something. If people accomplish what they want, then there would not be a purpose. It doesnt matter where we are, we could always be doing something. We could accomplish more by: helping our parents, being active, and helping our community.

My first reason, We could be doing something by helping our parents. It would be wonderful if we could help our parents at home, or, most thing may be done at home. Helping them by with laundry and cleaning the rooms, so, they dont be tire that much because they just come from work. Helping them with the chores would be a great choice because they would not be too tired from work. Helping our parents is good because they help us when we were little. By doing the chore is our responsibly because they could be mad.

My second reason, helping our community. Helping the community is a great choice because we could pick up trash so it doesnt pollute the our where we live. Helping other people good or bad. Some people could rape you or stole the money you have in your wallet. It depends of the people some people could be hypocrite and some people could be nice. The most important thing is help our community by pick up trash and cleaning the community. Our free time we could be helping the community so it doesnt pollute like other countries.

My last reason, being active anywhere we are. our health is important because if we dont care about our health, we could get disease. Doing one hour of exercise, workout, or something it could be good for our health. By always doing something our health could be healthy, and eat a good diet. Some of the disease are cholesterol, diabetes, and are other more disease if you dont eat healthy or you not do exercise. Being active is very important for you and other people.

Helping your parents is a great option because most things could be done. Helping the community is a great choice because we could pick up trash, so the community doesnt pollute where we live. Being active is very important because of your health. Your health is very important because you need to eat right and do exercise or workout.

To being, humans fail every time in life, every episode in our life there is always a failure, it is always there for us like if we need it and maybe this is why we always wondered why failure have to happen during the most incredible episode in our life, we always think this is because we did something bad or we did not tried our best as much as we can for get that job, pass that test or even keep all our problems in line, but why failure became a big role into our daily life?.

The reality of failure is not only fail, is to see what we did bad to get better, is to understand that we need to fail, understand that fail is good for us and help us to do not make the same mistakes that we did in the past because every time is a failure it is also an experience and a new lesson to success.

For example, scientists tried many experiments to just get one result and they fail very often but at the end they discovered new things not just only what they were looking for. This shows that not matter how many times you fail, there is always an answer and new things to discovered.

Furthermore, stay positive for humans could became a big issue in our community. Every human try everyday to stay positive and see all the mistakes as much positives as we can but this became more stressful after a failure.

What we all need to know is that feel stress, feel insecure of ourselves is good. We all are humans, our feelings make us more stronger than we actually are however, most people could feel depress after a failure and this is why we goes down, we loss our hope and most people stop to keep working in their goals and just get tired and feel depress.

For example, there is a book that the students of Generic_School were reading last year called ""The life of an Indian"". This book is about a poor Indian boy that lives in a reservation, he has no hopes after one day his teacher introduced the Indian to a different world out of the reservation to find hope and believe in himself, follow his dreams instead to keep poor in the reservation. He fail a thousand times, but instead to get back, he goes thought his issues.

This shows that stay positive after our failures even for a poor little boy is not always too hard. Clearly not everyone could do it that way, but we always want our happiness, and to get happiness, failure could became our big right hand.

In conclusion, join from our mistakes is the best way to be successful, to be better in life, to keep in mind that every failure is a new experience and a new lesson. Not matter how many times you fail, there is always an answer.

I am completely agree with Winston Churchill, feel enthusiasm for what go next in our life is more excited than we all think and as humans, if we start to believe in ourselves and stay positive and start to dream and also understand that failure is part of our daily, we will become more successful with the knowledge to how life really works and that life is not too hard as we all been thinking.

C4086056BD37,"High School

Regular high school is 4 years 9,10,11,12 grade for graduate. But students can graduate and 3 years some school has a programs that allow high school to graduate in three years,

this programas has three opcion for gradute in three years. The first opcion is summer school the scond opcion is evenings school and the last opcion is do not take any elective courses.

My first reason, why i think is better finish high school in three years for students is because all of the students high school are teenager and they need time for do stuff. So why i think is good idea finish high school in three years is because they could be take drive licenses, insurance, all stuff they need.

My second reason, is because all of the students are teenager, and some working for save money for college. If they can finish high school and three years they can working one year and same money for collage.

My third reason is because all the students who follow this programs could be more opcion for find a good college , and find a good place for live close of the family and find a good job.

conclusion.

I think this programs are good opcion for students who want going to college.",2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0

C51C5EA029D6,"There are many other ways, how we can choose our character traits. The first way is to choose our own character traits, by picking it for ourself. The second way is our character formed by influences beyond our control, by not being able to control it. The most reasonable character trait would be choosing our own character trails, because it makes the most sence out of all and most of the population can control on their emotions.

There are different types of character traits, for example funny, exiciting, joyful, and many more. Our character traits are formed by our own influence and by our own actions. That's what causes them to react from different types of emotions. For the most part, we are able to control our emotions, but sometimes we cannot control over them so they go out of control.

Character traits can be used in many different ways. However, there are some character traits that we can't control, it would happened to us by itself because we sometimes don't have control on ourself. For example anger, sadness, and depression are the reasons why we lose control sometimes because we are unable to control over it. These emotions can be dangerous once you are out of control, you don't even know what you will be doing, it could be something really terrible. That's the reason character traits can be good or bad sometimes.

Some people support the fact to pick there character traits for themself, some think it's not in our control and we are unable to control it. The people that said they decide to choose the character traits for themself, say when they do something they can feel the emotions in contol of them and do what best fits them. On the other hand, the people that think the charater traits is not in there control, say if they are working or doing anything the emotions of them just happens and they can't control it. In most of the cases it is caused by the bad emotions like being mad, or sad and more.

There are many more reasons of people talking about character traits. Not all of them are good nor not all of them are bad. It mainly depends on the person who is controling it. For the people that are unable to do so can control over it by doing couple simple things and not letting there emotions take over them. That's why controlling you're own character traits is different than having it controlled by some formed influence.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5

It really hard to teach young kinds because some older student don't even remember the work from any grade like me some time time my little sister be like can you please help me in be like am sorry dont even remember it really difficult to teach a young student. Older kinds have difficult time to teach young kinds they have different way that there teacher teach them how to there work. It really hard to know there work in explain the way we explain the kinds the better they understand what they supposed to do.We have to have a lot of passion to do it.

2.I think many student don't really get it because they older student some student don't really get it some of them dont get it fast but some of them need more extra work with it.Older student some time they explain good more then the teacher but for me it better in adult because will ask question in they know well because they teacher. Like some time i explain my sister what is bad but some time i don't know so I ask in adult to explain me really well that how in school work to young kinds may not really get the older kinds a younger need a adult to understand it well.

3.I go to a program is about math but i really understand because we share opinions of different work they do like student have com plenty different work they have it the hard way in the easy way student get more confused when they have com plenty different work like my math teacher I have different completely different work. I don't understand her nothing at all but I think because different language but asking some else in the program she explain the easy way i cant understand her.

4. Student can""t really get it they need some one to be beside them in tell them or teach them I really wonder if there were only one student or a lot because is program but if it was only one person they really can concentrate that really good because there a lot lot if there was more than one person it fine because it will be more help that the main effect if there was only one person in not a lot of them in was a big problem with then.if there were talking to much it was big problem for the program.

5. paying attention is really good thing so the student can really get the work they can get in learn what they do. The most important is if the young student get it if they don't get it they will fell the test because the older one properly know but can explain can find the easy way so the student can understand it really understand it good they really more information how to treat the student in explain it good make sure it good to them make sure not to just yell at them you have to have passion. talking with some one like your age understand it all of us have different kind of ways to explain it in to learn it.

C6555F21F7CD,"I believe that Winston Churchill's quote,""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", is true because after you make the mistake you learn how not to make that mistake again. The only way to learn how to be successful is to make a mistake. I think that you should always isten to your elders because they have been threw rough and happy days. When we are little, we always think that our parents are being really strict, but they're only trying to keep us happy.

I have made alot of mistakes when I was a pre-teen and I still make mistakes now,but at the end i realize that I was wrong. I was thirteen when I got my first phone and my parents always told me to not have social media till i'm sixteen. The only reason why my parents said,""no"", to social media was because they didn't want me to get hacked by people. All though, my parents said no to socail media i got it anyways. After couple weeks of having social media, someone decided to hack my snapchat. At that point, I realized my parents were always right.

My parents have made mistakes before too. When I waa a baby, my parents took me to my grandparents house for the first time. After we got to my grandparents home, my parents forgot to close the door behind us. So, I crawled out of the house and they didnt see me. After that, this guy saw me crawling down the streets and there were cars driving by me. So, the guy carried me to his shop to see if anyone comes to find me. After couple minutes, my mom realized I wasnt there so she ran out of the house to find me and than couple blocks down she saw in someones shop. My parents always checked if the door was closed after that incident.

Always keep in mind that you shouldnt do anything without thinking of the affects. If you not sure if its right or wrong, then you should ask someone for their opinion. If that doesn't work out than your probably doing something wrong. If you do something wrong then people will change the way they look at you. It better to keep in mind that your family and friends have faith in you.                                                      ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0

You will see your life in a different perspective, than people with negative attitudes. They doubt them selfs threw life and never reach there goal's because they dont have a positive attitude. You'll never give up easily or at all, because you see that it will help by making you fill more accumplished with yourself by having a positive attitude.

Having a positive attitude will also make you a good person. You'll show yourself and others how to change there attitude towards life. As you are accumplishing your own goal's in life, you could be helping others do the same. So by helping people out with the way you see your life, you could help others reach the same goal on positive attitude with there lives. life its self, is the biggest challenge anyone can go threw. Where put threw challenges everyday with out even knowing, and get threw them no matter how hard it may be. By helping others it could make' not just you seced in life but others as well.

Even my family and I have been threw the worse. From living in room's, basement's, and being envicted from apartment's because my parents would'nt make enough money to keep us in one place. They were losing alot of hope with life and from ever being stable for there family, but me as the only boy in the family I had to keep my positive attitude in life for our family goal in reaching stablebility for my older and younger sibling and I. I would wake up on top of some folded blankets the hard wooden floor with my mom and dad aside me but I would'nt care cause as long as I knew my little siblings were on the bed comfortbly sleeping it would make me feel good because I knew one day it was all going to change.

Keeping my positive attitude with my life really helped me alot, because once I turned 16. I started to work at Mcdonald's everday after school from 3:30pm to 10:00pm for five days a week. Everytime I got payed I would save up my checks because I knew my parents never had good cars. We would always buy junky cars off the road, because we could never afford new cars. So I set my self a goal on buying my parents a new car, because I knew it could help them out. By not spending on old cars, I also knew they could never save up from all the stuff they had to pay and such. There were many days at work where I wanted to quit, but I would always look on how my family and I lived. Also on how much my parents struggled just to give us hot food on the table. So I always kept my positive attitude with me for my family.

The day came after 1 year of working I had saved up over 10k for a new car for my parents and the family. My mom and my dad where so proud of me and told me they could never thank me enough for all the hard work I had put in everyday at work for the family. Me and my family started to gain hope on our family after they saw what a big change I had made to the family just by having a positive attitude. So my two oldest sister's and I where starting to save up for a home for the family and that too, we had accomplished. Now we have a home that we have been living in for 5 years now, everyone has there room I bought my self a car too. Life is good and I feel super successful with my life already.

It well effect everyone at the school because there are some student that dont like school very much. So by extend the hours they will not show up to school and that will effect the school and them.

I dont think it well be a very good because there might have some student that have work after school. Or they might have to go and pick up there little brother or sister. And by extending the hours it will not let them do it because they have to be in school and some student will lose there job because they had to stay at school all day.

Some student might have to walk to school and if you extend the school hours then it well get dark and then they cant walk home alone. It will get dangers to go home alone so its best if the hours stay the same because then they will all be fine and by keeping it all the same can help a lot of people.

By extending the school hours the student might not be mad to stay all day at school so some student will not show up at school. Because they will not want to show up at school because they dont want to and that will effect everyone that u know. Because the student will fail and that wont help them at all.

If you extend the school hour then there is going to be more homework to do and held at the end. Because there is go to be more work to do at the end.

Some teacher are going to have some thing to do and work at thing at there homes so by extending the hours the teacher that have think to do they will not be abole to do it and that will make them mad and then they will quit sand that would not be a good idea for the school and the teacher and the student.

So that is why we shouldn do it because it will effect a lot of people and then it will make al lot of people not very happy so if we just keep it the way its soapstone it will be all OK cause then the student will be happy and the teachers will be happy so keeping it the way we have it will help a lot of people.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0

yes, i think high school district should allow students to graduate in years. high school students should graduate in 3 years because most students have all there credits,they can go to college earlier, also you would have another year to explore new things.

Most student have all there credit by the 3 ears of high school so which mean i think they should be able to graduate in 3 years instead of 4 years because they would be wasting another year in high school and they would have been able to go to college and so they can can already be studying what they want to become in the future.

Student who graduate earlier they can start going to college earlier it can be benefictional for you and people should take advantage of it and they would get college done faster and you would be almost be set on their career and moving on making money because every one want to go to college and e

Third reason is why school should allow students to graduate 3 years instead of 4 years because students would have a year to explore and try new thing maybe find a little better part time job save some maybe even rent a basement or something

In conclusion high school students should graduate in 3years not 4 years of high school.

Some say by graduating early you would not be getting the full experience of the four year high school but there are benefits when you graduate earlier. In the future i think school students should only have to go to high for only 3 years.              ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0

C78AC0CB25F9,"A positive attitude is the key to success in life. A position of the body or manner of carrying oneself. Do yo prefer a person whit bad attitude or good attitude?, think about it. In my position i agree with the statement, because; people get better communication with others, get more jobs, and students have more opportunities.

Some people think attitude reflect self confidence to society, as positive attitude reflect peace and happiness. For example: When i have a positive atittude; i see more people want to know about me , but when i have a bad attitude nobody want to know me, because they know people with a positive attitude reflect more friendly, furthermore people with positive attitude have better relation with their family, friends and communitie as they energy is more pleasant.

A positive person with good attitude get more jobs. In some companies a positive attitude is a requirement for the employer. People who have a positive attitude do better works. for example: I am waitress and my boss say all the time "" if you want to be a good customer service you need to have a good attitude"" and thats true because when i have a good attitude with the costumers they give me a good tips, but when i have a bad attitude i get bad tips. Customers want a good service, employer want to make good money and companies want a good workers.

Some Schools want students with positive attitude. A student attitude is important because help them to get a better school opportunities. For example: Sports, Science, and others Team's in schools; the good attitude is a requirement if you want to be part of them. Students with a negative attitude have difficulties to connect with the class and work in a group. However, students with a good attitude facility they own work, and the teachers work, because if a student have a bad attitude is more difficult that teacher or coach teach them and help as student is good in those things, but have a bad attitude he/she loss the opportunitie to show their capacities.

I absolutely agree with that statement, because in my opinion I see success as a goal that everyone on this earth should somehow reach to. However, it's not that easy and not everyone is able to to that.

For example, my father is a successful business man by helping others and our family, he has done a lot for me. He also took risks and failed multiple times in order for him to be successful in life. Not just because he has a lot of money, because otherwise not every rich individual is successful. You must fail in order to better yourself and learn from your mistakes, because that will benefit you in the long run.

For me, I want to be a successful business man, just like my dad. I also want to travel around the world, and gain knowledge. but my goal for know is to pass all my classes with a high GPA, to show my parents and myself that I can do it. Yes, I failed one of my classes before but I didn't give up. As Winston said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". I'm going to keep working hard in order to graduate and chase my dreams, just like my father did.

In the conclusion, I think that Winston said a true statement. I personally agree with him, because in order to be successful in life you will either need to learn from your personal mistakes or others. That's honestly what I am doing right now, since I'm still a teenager. Learning from others help you develop new skills and knowledge, especially from the old generation.

C8620D9D22DC,"I think by having older students with younger students would be helpful. Because older students can help the younger students with homework,projects and classwork. Older students how to do the right things that can help the younger students.

To begin with, having older students can teach the younger students on what they need help with in school. This can be really helpful to younger students because with help someone that is older then you they can help you improve in school. Like for example my friend is one year older then me and helps me with school work when I need it. Older students can help teachers by help the students with classwork. Having older students in a program can be useful because they can show the younger students how to act the right way in class,and show others to do what they need to do.

Additionally, younger students can look up to older students that they trust. Because they have helped them in school and having fun spending time with each other. Some younger students might think an older student can treat them as a sibling. Like for example I see one of my friends as a sibling because we have been friends since we where little and I trust them. So it's good to look up to some one that you trust and count on and be their for you when you need them.

Finally , I think having older students and younger students in the same program would be great. Because older students can show the younger students how to be right and do what your teacher tells you what to do. And parents want their kid to do good in school so they can have a good life to live. Having a mix of older and younger students can learn to do things together. By having older students it can effect the younger students to do good in school.

Distant learning is already being used through online and video conferencing, This days colleges and universities allows students to choose online courses of their own choices . Students are used to online stuff like, web browsing, gaming, and etc. which gives them an extra advantage already. They would be more successful using online browsing. Video conferencing is another way of distant learning; this would let the teachers talk to students in case they need help. People has been using video conferencing to even take tests at home.

Distant learning would also help them have success in education socially. If students are to stay at home to learn, they would feel more comfortable around somewhere they been for a long time. They could ask people, family members who they are comfortable with, for help if they wanted to. They would be more fit and ready than going to school considering that you have to wake up early in the morning, get ready and walk to school. They wouldn't have to do any of this, and have enough sleep to have a fresh mind to work with.

C92C73888D49,"In my opinion

Thomas Jefferson wrote a statement that makes people think that, there's people out there who don't accomplish if we are doing something or we are not doing something. No one is grateful for peoples struggles and hard work they may thank you but they won't mean it.

Imagine being in a world where people thank you for every single thing that makes you feel respected and needed for more work and accomplish what we suffer for and we do it because of the need of some personal struggles your going through. If humans were different by showing others there help and respectful this world would of make every single thing differently. Some people are accomplish of your hard work , some people never care others people hard work they just say thanks without meaning it and can say stuff behind your back.

Although humans think they doing the right thing, they aren't we should be a world without cruel no one knows how damage a person can be and fake it just because they want to accomplish the work they have to turn in or be finish with because they will know that if they don't finish the work it would be harder for them to get rid of you with your negativity. For example people don't serve Hispanics equally for differences but most of us have but our effort on work hard to earn some cents to take to our family but no one sees that all they do is put there own rude opinion on us. We shouldn't care what others say as long as you know your a great person with a huge heart your good.

It would be wonderful how much may be done if we are always accomplishing others people work and being grateful for peoples effort, it would be a great idea if every single person listen to our life story before talking. Can't you imagine how many kids needs our help and we might see them with some eyes that we think there okay but they are really not. Humans have the benefit to change and become a different person and accomplish a goal to become someone grateful for little things and make the world a different place with different though.

We should take a position to serve people with kindness, respect and give them a hand for there need of help sometimes helping others can make you a great person you can never know one day you will need the help of someone too and you will feel how much it hurts to not receive help from others or by someone you though wold of help you out you should always tell people how grateful you are for having them because they will realize you once helped them and they will help you out on the need of help, they will serve you as how you will serve them by now on, you can't judge a book by it's cover,

Thomas Jefferson wrote "" Determine never to be idle.."" and what i think about what that means is that you should not be ungrateful and you should help others, with simple words that are accomplishments.

The studies of

Thomas Jefferson old days history probably were different they did things differently and though different ladies suffer in the old days, now everything is sort of different they accomplish women for the things they do and treat us better than how women were treated back in the days ,

Thomas Jefferson wants things to be different and probably doesn't want people to do the same mistakes they did in time of history. We should all be a group of good people and do the right things the right way. We can make this world different if we stand up for others and help the world who need help and accomplish them with needs they need and everything would be different and make people think different.",2.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.5
C93925EDB882,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote a quote that has Inspired me,""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"". I truly agree with this quote because it demonstrates who you really are by doing hard work,everyone has something to give to the world and it is important for self esteem.

By doing a lot of hard work and not giving up, it demonstrates to people who you really are, that you are a person who is determined to get where they want to be and who preservers no matter what the chanlleges are. People may or may not agree with what want you want to do, their are always going to be someone who is going to try to bring you down emotionaly, physically or mentally but you have to show them that you are going to be yourself and do what whatever it needs to take to accomplish it. This reminds me of myself because in my senior year of High School I didn't have enough credits in order to graduate that really got my family disappoint that the time I was going to an online school and it was harder for me to make up for all the classes but I saw how my own family started to put me down and it did hurt my feelings but that used that feeling to pick myself up and work everyday on the classes to be able to graduate on time. This showed people and most importantly it showed me that im capable of showing people who I really am by doing hardwork.

I think everyone has a lot to offer to this world, you never know who will be the next person to discover a cure for a illness that people thought it was terminal. Everyone is capable of doing what there heart desires it just take determination, hard work and desire to accomplish what you want. People should not listen to what other's say it only matters what you know that you can accomplish and that you believe in yourself that is all it takes to became and be where you want to be. My plans after High School is to go to college to become a ultrasound technician. I speak two languages Spanish and English and I believe because I speak two languages fluently I have something to give to the world, to the community and to any one in need. I know my own family wanted me to be a lawyer to help people with immigration lawsuits and for a while I started to consider following my parents dream of me being a lawyer to make them happy but my passion for the medical field was bigger and from my knowledge a big percent of pregnant women are Hispanic and as a person who speaks Spanish very well,I think I could help out people who don't know English in order to get the resources they need.

Being yourself and showing the world what you are capable of shows the world that you believe in yourself and it is important for your self esteem too because it makes you feel good about yourself and most of time your going to be alone doing your own stuff, taking care of your business. You can not always depend on people to get you what you need, to get you where you want to be. I remember when I moved out of my parents house with my son and having my own room, my own space and paying bills made me feel so good about myself. I finally felt like I was doing something for myself because my parents wanted to keep me at home but I managed to get through everything and anything while living on my own and It made me more independent person and it helped me boost my energy and believe in myself.

Nevertheless, Author Ralph Waldo Emerson quote ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"". This quote has reminded that you should truly believe in yourself, be yourself, do hard work and it will motivate you to be where you want to be. I think this quote has a lot of different meanings and I think it depends on your own personal experiences and It has honestly helped me a lot through my teenage year and overall my biggest accomplishment was to follow my heart and be who I really want to be in life just like the Ralph Waldo Emerson said.

C97C2190DB65,"Imagine someone asking another person wheither they should go to a friend's party or to the movies, but he or she told them something like, ""It's up to you to decide, not me"". That person eventually agrees; but when they finally decide on wheither to go to the party or to the movies at the last minuate, they end up missing out on both. Sometimes, making decisions on your own can be pretty tough and frustrating, but it helps you become more independent and you do not have to relay on other people's decisions.

People can not depend on other people for what they think all the time. It shows that instead of being progressive with their work or anything else they're doing, that person can not make up their minds or is just being lazy and is always looking for someone else's opinions instead of their own. This also shows that they are not self-reliant or progressive like how most people usually are.

Making our own decisions also means following our own intincts. For example, a group of teenagers are planning to skip school to got the beach for the entire day. They try to convince two other of their classmates to join them, but they told them no and that they are going to get in trouble for missing out on their classes. Trusting our intincts can be very helpful when it comes to things like skipping school, alcohol, or even having sex with someone. It can maybe even save your life or someone else's in the future.

It also helps people become more independent on their own. People can not always depend on their parents for the rest of their lives, they will have to move out of the home they grow up in to start looking for jobs and earning to support themselves. Another example is when a teenager starts appling for colleges that they want to go once they graduate from high school. They probably have been told that college will help them get ready for when they are ready to get a full-time job (which also has to be something they want to do for a long period of time), pay taxes and bills for when they have a house or apartment to live in, and maybe even take care of their familes.

People should make their own decisions because they can not always depend on other people's opinions, they should follow their own intincts that can probably save their lives one day, and it helps them become more independent to get ready for the future.   ",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,3.5,4.0

This can improve human society in many ways by making life more easy, even kids nowadays are using different sources to find something fun to do or watch for example on the platform YouTube kids can find toys reviews or cartoons which its fine but that's also keeping them from playing outside.

Playing basketball for the school is a good thing,for an example:Your getting sponsored,you get to participate in activities like drills,and you get to play against teams from other county schools. If you make it to the basketball team you have to be healthy because high school is different how you play from different other leagues and also you have to work out a'lot to get in a good shape so you can have a higher advantage on driving a lane or shooting a three on you opponents while playing basketball.

One important thing is that you gotta listen to your coach and have good sportsmanship because if you do,then you will have a perfect team to win the championship game because if you do good college coaches might scout and look for good players that knows how to handle the ball and play defense so they can prevent the other team from scoring. If you do really good on both of those things then you might have a good advantage that college coaches might pick you to be on the team.

My second favorite sport that i would choose would be football because in my personal opinion football is the best sport because you get to tackle people. If you participate in football for your school you have to go training because there will be defensive and offensive coaches that will be there to train so you can get on the team for high school football. In training,you would do dead lifts,hills,drills,weigh lifting,and scrimmages. You have to do those things because thats what coaches want to see,they want to see their players train hard because the players want to make the coaches know that they will work and train hard to make the team.

Finally, the best sport to choose would be football because it is a very aggressive sport and also the sport is very hard and you have to be a lucky person to make it to the NFL.This will be a very hard thing because you also have to do good school but if you dont the coaches might think about cutting you out of the team because they want your grades to be perfect. If you make it to college and you do good, you can be the luckiest people to be invited ti the NFL combine.

Sometimes the success in the work is not easy to get, but neither impossible.

Finally, the people have many goals in their future, but also have obstacles to get success. The goals are difficul to accomplish, but not difficult to do.

In my conclusion, we nedd to be a ligth between that people is addictive in their phone. Because that bad for they life and their future. That was I agree, because technology is nor the best thing human created.     ",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
CE2EC298670A,"I think that it a good that some schools offer distance learning for the students because some of them can't go to the regular schools and some of them are not able to finished one school and the distance learning offer a good idea for them. and is a very good experience. If can be a good apportunity for does who can't fiinish the school for example

Some of the students have kids and have to take care of them.

Another reason is that the students does not have the support of their family and they have to work for them self.

Also the family of the students can not affords the students education.

The person who received the distance learning it an oldest person who does not finish the school and that person is trying to finished now for get a better job.

I think it good that some of schools offer distance learning. First some of the students that are taking the distance learning have kids and they need to take care of the kids. Next The students does not have their family support and they have to support them self and work. Also the families of the students can not affords the student education. And finally the person or students that received the distance learning it an oldest person who does not finish the school and is tying to finish now to get a better job. because with a better job they can support the baby they have and the things they want to finish up.

First some of the students that are taking the distance learning have kids and they need to take care of them. Also the students a girl or boy get a pregnancy when they go to school and they had to leak of school for the baby. Also the parents make them to work because they have to support a baby. And some moms have to leak school because the other parent of the kid does not take care of the baby when she was pregnant. Study in the distance learning program they want work in the day and in the night they cant received classes.

Next another good reason is that the students does not have the support of their families and have to work for them self. Some of the kids are immigrants and they doesn't have their parents in this country. And also the student have to work and maintain by them self. The students have to work and go to school .But sometime get difficult for them and the time it not always log as they want to do many things at the day. And it better to have a option .Because with that option that can still working and receiving a good education.

Also another reason is that the families of the students can not affords the students education. And they try to do another thing for them like the parent can buy a computer. And with that the student can received the classes online or in the distance learning. But some of them use their phone to received their classes. Also some of them like to study but their parents cant not affords the school and they try to do anything to get a good education and a better future. Because that is going to help them to be able to have a family. And with that they prepare for the future.

The last reason that why is a good idea to get the distance learning is because some of the people that is getting the classes online are oldest people the they did not finish the school and now they're trying to finish the school .Because they want a better job and a better future for their family and their kids. Some of them did not finish the school and they now want to finished. They just want a opportunity to study and the distance learning give that opportunity to the old people that want to overcome. And that is a great help for the people that just want a better life a great future for them and their families. With that the people who is trying to finished the school can be prepare to have better opportunities of work. And also finished the school he or she can get a better job and be able to be with their kids. And don't leave their kids with another person many time. And spend more time with them.

In conclusion the distance learning education is a very good idea in my opinion. because the people that can not go to school because they have kids or the teenager that have a pregnancy when they were on the school. That give opportunity for the people with low income. The people that can afford their school. And also the people that does not have their family in this country. The people who work and study and does not have the time to go to a regular school. Classes in online is good for does that need to finish the school. For does that when they were in the school have some problems. Also is a good benefit for those that there time is not long as they want. The people of the distance learning have good opportunity for their future. And can be productive for the people who does not have a work because they did not finish the school. because have an education is important for this country and for all the people that want a good life and better opportunities of work. Finally the distance education is a good ideas because help people with the things they want and that they need too.    ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0
CEFDC545C24F,"Should high schools extend the school day two hours. This is important because students need time to learn the maternal. I think students will get a better benefit from two hours more. My first reason is students will have a better education learning. My second reason is students wouldn't have to stay after school hours to get get help, while they have extra time in class to ask any questions.

Students will have a much better understanding on the subject. The high schooners would get to learn the maternal more, spend more time on the subject. They would ask more questions on the topic. Students wouldnt fail if they spent more time to learn it. They would have more practice and more additives to do in class. Because some teacher teach it way to fast because of the sols they have to finish all of the units before sols. We have to be prepared for the sols but we have to take time on it learn it.

Students will have time to learn everything, therefor they wouldnt have to stay after school.

Students wouldnt have to waste teachers time after school to caught up what they messed from class. Teachers have to come home to there families too. Most teenagers have jobs so some of them cant stay after school. Some students dont have rides after school. They would have a three day weekend. Only go to school four days of the week. Have time to study on the weekends.

This is why high school should extend two hours more of school. They will have a better understanding. They need time to learn the maternal in time for the sols. The highers schools will have a better knowledge. They would know the maternal on time for the sol comes, more will pass it if they understand it more.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
CFBD5DD8ECFD,"Having shorter summer break can be beneficial for students to remember information. Although, some students enjoy having long summer breaks, but I think there should be year-round schools because students can have 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall.

I believe it is enough for students to have 3-4 week break in summer because long summer break can make students bored and forget all information that they already learned in school. For example, in three weeks I can go to beach with my parents and friends. I can start my basketball practices, learn new skills, and be more active. Also I will not forget any informatin that I learned in school in three weeks. So this is the good reason that schools should have three week summer breaks.

The second reason that schools should be year-round is because students can have longer winter breaks and celebrate the new year with their family. For example, one of my friend loves winter break and he always wanted to go back to his country and celebrate the new year with his family but he never got chance to celebrate the new year with his family because he didn't have time because of school. So having longer winter break can help most of the students to go to their country and celebrate the new year with their family.

The last reason that schools should be year-round is because students can get a week off in every season of the year. For example I love to go out with my friends in spring because it's close to summer and weather is very nice to spend time with your friend. Me and my friends always like to play soccer in spring because it is so fun and you can enjoy the weather while you playing soccer. In addition I can rest and sleep more during the weeks off in each season, so I don't get tired and get bad grades in school.

In the end I agree with having year-round schools because students can have 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. So government should start thinking about these issues and make schools year-round. ",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0
CFD0D13D3180,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill got the concept that ""success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."". Many people failed and successed in life. Some people learn by their own mistake, fail is part of growth. Others, feel like to fail is being a loser and cannot admit their defeat from a battle. In other words, they have no modesty. Success consist to not give up on your goals, to not leave your dreams from a simple mistake; to not describe yourself as a coward.

Many people failed during their career, even the most professionals, but they kept trying. It may be that to fail bring some issues of closed minds, fears, etc. For example, There is a doctor that knows the hard work to finally done with college plus to achieve what you'd love to be. This doctor studied for 7 years, this is a huge and long way of his career. As you know doctors never stop studying because the technology changes every year. Therefore, the start is not easy as, others, thought because the first stage of college, it may be the hardest stage than the others. Some people fail the first test, or the first semester so they prefer to abandon their studies than do better in college. This doctor have failed on the way of his career, but prefered to ask for help instance of giving up. The importance of failing is to learn and the importance of learning is to success in life. Above this, a 15 years old guy used to fail in High School and this student was down-hearted, but the family supported him without criticize him. It was not easy because some are not smart enough, but this 15 years old guy put a little bit of effort and now he is a doctor in Spain.

Failure to faliure is the key of succes. Besides, Failure gives you more knowledge of your mistake and opens your mind to discover news to things to learn. For example, a cook is trying to do new dishes from differents cultures. Now, the cook wants to try peruvian dishes because the gastronomy of Peru is one of the most populars in the world. Also, this would be a benefit because will gain more money. By trying these new dishes, the cook fails because most of the customer did not like the food plus received many critical comments. As many cooks receives many critical comments, they decide to abandon the kitchen and do something different. This cook enjoyed when he commited a few or big error; to do better next time. Learned to do better the new peruvian dishes, listened to the rest of people and finally, succeded in the kitchen.

Some feel ashamed to fail, they usually compare themselves to others because life is a competition and this may bring issues of insecurity. That is one of the biggest problems that many people have in these days. If there are 2 lawyers that wants to face a case of an innocent and important person, who is involved, in a serious problem. The best lawyer would defend the case and will be recognized as one of the best, would get inmmediatly many jobs for being recommended. On the other hand, if a lawyer fails a case would not get inmmediatly many cases often. Therefore, the lawyer knows that to fail have a positive side of learning, gives you more skills of how to face any case.

In conclusion, as Churchill said that to fail is the start to success. As many people fail, they learn. Some people are not smart enough, but they put effort of what they want to do. Even though they fail, they keep trying because is the ability of their knowledge. People that are already professionals, they make mistakes and enjoy of their mistakes because they learn more of their speciality. Finally, even if you want to be the best of something, do not feel ashamed because life is a competition and do not closed your mind of making a few mistake. ",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0

The phrase that Duke Ellington said is a good phrase and i totally agree with it because the problem you have or that you will get is a chance for you to do you best at fixing it or solving because the problem will give you a chance to do your best unlike if you come across a problem of just get a problem and you dont try to fix it or dont care or sit back and just watch your problems just pile up and then problems just come and come one after another then you have more then one problem and its just better if you do good on your first problem and you fix an if its big problem and you over come it at the end you will feel great like Duke Ellington he is now legend at jazz music and you know t is not easy to get were he got to be called a legend at jazz music and on his way to the top to become a legend all ways remembered every were you go for he had to over come lots of problems the hate the way he was going to play jazz were he would play his jazz to start up who could give him a boost or help with the jazz to be known more around him were he would get more new instruments money for a place to keep all his music how would he sell his music and all those problems he had to over come and fix and he still made it to his dream and know he is legend.

D044FCEAE0D7,"Based on my experiences

I agree with Emerson's statement when he said, ''Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow''. sometimes in life we have to do things that we already have mastered but it never grow. One time when was little child I learned that I can't master the things that I already have done.

For example; My brother took his master degree when he was 22 years, now he wen back to school to take his master degree again .He regret what he already took his master degree in the past and come back to take it again it did't help him it all. another example my friend decided open his old store after the government shut it down. he open store and the government came and shut it down again. I learned in this life somethings that we mastered we should leave it behind and move on to different things. I try do something I dont liked it didn't work it all but when I try work on the stuff and things that I like it works and master it no matter what the thing is. This why in life we should master the things we like and never go back to it .

While, I understand that some people disagree with Emerson's statement when he said, ''Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow'' and could be right sometimes we should master all the things we have been done in the past .

These are the reasons and specific examples why I agree with Emerson's statement when he said

People who are motivated all the time tend to rich a 99% of their goals easily at school or Colleges. As they know being focus is the key to succeed in life. But those who has never tried are the ones to come last , because they do not have enough motivation or self-confidence to do it.

In some cases people are reponsible for their own motivation in life and what'd help them to be successful it is to take good decison.

There are so many opportunities out there, that will make us to be better and what we don't have to do is to make mistakes that will lead us to bad life style. Because later on we won't have second chance to prove our skills and be someone important to admire.

Although people who has a positive attitude are trustful, smart, and kind etc. Even they could help people to reach their dreams. But not always people have the same motivation or satisfaction to stand up and fight for what should be helpful and worthy. Most people tend to give up, because they think it's complicated or hard to get it. But if they do not put a bit of effort to make it won't happened. The success of a person is being dedicated all the time and no matter how hard it's going to be. But they will always give their lives to make it real and that's when they realized that all the effort was for a good reason to be on where they are now.

Those who keeps a positive attitude are the ones to inspire other people by writing books, quotes, poems, etc. People look at them as a way to motivate themselves and believe they can do the same to reach their goals. Sometimes people apply their concepts as how to be successful in life and what it is required to the success of school. People just have to be apassionate for things they love to do in their daily life and the opportunity to prove they are better. Even they will shine like a pearl for the effort and work ethic.

D16B3304A010,"A positive attitude is the key to success in life.

Can you imagine the world without positivity? Some people are doing successful achievements through the positive attitude, but others have a discrepancy to that. I believe that positivite attitude is important because positivity points to the healthy mental health, genial and successful accomplishments.

To begin with first reason, there are successful and unsuccessful people in the world. We are all humans, and we all have feelings, strenghts, weakneasses. Usually, those weaknesses make me stronger and give me lessons, and good lessons bring the keys to the successful doors. Life is like a school, teaches, tests, grades. However, my attitude decides who I want to be, but the importance is in being positive.

Another reason, ""being positive"" for me means being patient. For example, the person who is admiring me everytime. He is my father. I know all of his experiences connected with his job. There were a diffucult times too but because of his positive attitude, he is at proffessional level of his military career. I remember, when he had strict bosses, not very loyal friends, when we had the money shortgage. My parents teach me everytime: ""It doesn't matter where are you, be mature show them respect, take your community to the positive sides, be kind. Therefore, it will help you to be successful"".

On the other hand, some people say that the world is diffucult and success is not in the positivity because there are other things like money, good community, good education. Yes, that is true, but thinking positive and having efforts to accomlish something, that is already success. Success doesn't mean being rich and eminent. For me success is when I follow my dreams, help people, motivate them to be positive. However, there is the times when there is no place positivity, like loosing someone, or being unresponsible for something, hurting someone's feelings.

Eventually, to be successful in life, I have to stay positive in difficult situations. I like to be humor ,when I want to cry. I am responsible for my life and I choose positivity to achieve accomlpishments to be better and helpful to the community because that would help me to be successful and success makes the bliss!",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0

Some people believe that students would do better if their classes are at home. I believe that you can learn more if you are in a regular class than just being at home because students can learn from other cultures or more things about life with other friends, if students do not interact with others in a future they are going to be afraid to do it, and finally if you are in a regular school you can do more activities and share with your friends.

First, when you are in a school of the united states you learn a lot from other cultures. Therefore besides than world geography, you learn from your friends countries and how is to live there. Also, when you have friends at school you share your problems and most of the time you learn more things about life with them and how you can be a better person.

Second, sometimes there can be shy people at school because they do not know how to interact with others or how to start a conversation. When you do activities in groups sometimes you make new friends and talk to others became easily than before. However, if students do not learn how to talk to others in public places they are going to be afraid in a future; imagine if they need to make a presentation at work, they are not going to be able to do it because they will be afraid to talk in front of all the co-workers. Learn how to interact with others is important for your future.

Third, it is important to get involve in activities at school; activities help you with your curriculum when you apply to college. Also, if you are in any activity you can share more with your friends. However, when you get involved with activities at school helps you to clear your mind when you have to many homework or when you are stress out about your classes. Therefore, some of the activities give a lot of skills in the thing that you would like to do in your future.

In conclusion, if students do not interact with others or neither have a friend to talk with, and they do not have activities to get involved with other people; students are not going to be successful if they try in a future to interact with a large group of people. Therefore, it is very important to learn from others and interact at your school. That is why I believe that everybody should take classes on a regular school, to learn how to get involved with others and be able to express your self.   ",3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.5

Although sometimes cell phones in school might be used for personal reasons like soical media the pros of being able to use your cell phones in school outweigh the cons. In todays current society millions of people use electronic devices at work and school , Schools should implement more use out of technology and let kids use their phones in class to help complete tasks assigned to them ,

for example , If a kid does not want to use a dictionary and to find a word he can easily just look up the words meaning on he internet using his phone.

If someone needs to call you during school they can easily do it by just dialing up your number instead of having to call the school. It is much easier to call someone during school on there celluar device instead of having to call the school wait for the school to find the classroom the student is in and then transfer the call to the student in that classroom. In case of a family emergency , parents , relatives will call you on your phone most likely they will not call the school. I have had personal experiences with that as my parents do not contact the school when they wish to speak to me , they call me on my cell phone.

Implementing better rules in school for cellphone usage is beneficial , instead of punishing a student for having there phone out in the classroom the school should make better use out of cellphones by allowing students to have them out and or use them. More schools , classes are making it easier to access assignments that can be completed online ,

you can view what assignments you have to complete in class by using your cellphone instead of being overwhelmed with paperwork , your tasks can be completed online.

We have to help the government by paying taxis so they can do something to the country make the roads safer for us so we can drive in a better roads. We always have to do something that the people whos lives in the country proud of us such as the police mans, military and air forces or anything else who ever work they should be honest with their work. That way we can do something for the country.

In conclusion we always have time to work its never late if we want work or do something and instead of staying home is better if we work outside.       ",3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0

D344D0003B84,"Every person has their own feelings, emotions, and their own talents. But people are thinking that if they that talent or skill, and they can not do that in front of the world or people. As all people has different talent, that they really want to show to people. Before they think about their talent to chance their own world, they will be so nervous that they can't do that. They will be afraid, they will not show that to people that can learn from it. That they can try it on their own life, so they can learn new thing from new people. Over 90% of all people in the world has their own talent or skills because they are being being appreciated that who are they, and by believing on their self that how hard they worked.

To begin with, one way that all people can develop their talent is by being appreciated on their self that who they are, and how they can change the world. For example, one day it was our first day that we came to America, and I even didn't know that much English that I can talk to person. So one year later I learn some English, and I got to 8 grade, by other day we were going to do the student let decision. I really did not talk that much because I was so nervous about it like how I have to talk in front all the teachers, and students. I wanted to try it but I couldn't do that. This evidence shows that, being in different country and not knowing their language is really hard. My mom, and dad was always trying so hard that one day I will be able to speak English. My mom, and dad were always telling me that ""always be appreciated that how you got to this level, and think about hoe you can make different talents that people can see, so they can improve it on their life."" After that day I told to my self "" I always will be able to be appreciated to my self, and by being in this world."" As always that one day I will show my talent to people that I never thought of that one day I will learn English too. clearly, if I wasn't being appreciated to my self, to my teachers, to my family that they were working with me together. I wasn't be able to even write this essay. now even if I am not that much perfect I am happy that I got to that point that I and my family really wanted.

In addition, there is other way that you can show your talent to people by believing in your self that you can get to your goal by working hard as much as you can do it, and as much as possible. So you can see the result of it by your working hard. For Example, my brother Generic_Name, he is in 12 grade, for him it was really hard because he was always worrying about his grades, and he was saying ""how I can get to finish my

12 grade by being a perfect student. He was always wondering about his self, and that how hard will be next year.

One day my mom, and dad told him that ""if you believe in your self, by that time you already got this."" this evidence shows that,

Generic_Name couldn't believe on his self. Generic_Name wanted to know that how he can show his own talent . He was always worked hard to improve in his new talents or skills. Now he got to finish his 12 grade by being successful. By next year he will go to collage. Clearly, if Generic_Name didn't listen to my mom, and dad he wasn't able to finish his 12 grade by showing to all of his teacher that how he improved om his talents.

In conclusion, developing your talent or skill is a different way or different thing that you can bring it into your own life. By being appreciated and believing in your self that change your life, and bringing a smile up on your family face. As always people want to develop new talent to their own life to make them change, different, and happy. Clearly, being in a different country, far from your own family, And you can't see them. It's really hard for everyone especially me with my family. But I got a strong talent that no one can pull me back from it. For bring appreciated to my have that they were working together with me that I can get to this part. Today I realize that how much I improving in own life, in writing, and speaking English. Even if not that much perfect. And like Generic_Name, he believe on his self, and he worked hard that he got to that point. Now he is working hard that he can make this world a better place for his future that is coming up. Clearly, if you want to improve in your own life or in you own talent or skill that is in your heart, and that can show your develop to the people for this world, and it will be applying to your own goals. Always be thankful, be appreciated to your family, teacher that they worked hard for you to learn new things that will persuade you to your new goals. As everyone has a talent to the world, And that way they can change the world too. Always work hard in your life if you want to develop your talent. By improving a skill can make your own place, and your own world beautiful as they can see the result of it at the end.  ",3.0,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.0,3.0
D35A126B4379,"Anyone can have a talent or skill, you just need to see what it is. They can help along the way to get you something really helpful, for example collage. Your talent can be playing an instrument, singing, or dancing. A skill can be building things, sports, and cooking. The talent I have is playing a Guitar because it took time, practice, and studying.

When you want to do something big it can take a lot of time. Time is what we all need and time can go fast or slow, but thats good because it can really be helpful. Playing the Guitar took a while but it payed off, mostly because I used my free time to play. Sometimes I can get stress playing mainly by not having much time playing before a concert. It could be hard doing it ,but by doing so I can see my self getting better each day.

Practicing could get hard, but if your relax and not think too much you'll see it will be easy. Practicing can make you accomplish anything you've been doing a long time. Doing the Guitar was hard but not too hard because I've been practicing for a while. Playing some of the songs were fast and long, but when I got home I'd play the song over and over until I got it just right. Thats how I know by practicing is really helpful and made me be good at doing the I wanted to do the most in life.

Some people don't like to study and its not something we have to do, but something we need to do. I think studying is more of a thing you want to do if you care so much about what your doing. Studying the notes was one of the first things I had to do before playing the Guitar and the songs. By studying I can see the notes were not that easy to play and also tuning the Guitar, but thats why I studied to see what I was doing wrong. Studying is what I did to be fantastic at the Guitar also being amazing at the concerts.

In conclusion, If you want to be awesome at what your doing you need to use your time wisely, practice, and study. By doing all that you'll see that you will be amazed at what you did. Maybe you can even be famous for what you did by focusing on your goal. To sum this all up just do at what you do best in life maybe it can pay off real good.``",3.0,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5

D3A6B04B54A9,"Should school have a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall? People said most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. Some people argue that there should be year round schools, where there would be a 3-4 week break in summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. However I believe that students should have a longer summer break because a long summer break will give the student time to travel, spend time with their family, and work in summer. The first thing you can do by having a long summer break is travel overseas without worried about how many day you can stay. By travel overseas you need time to explore the country go around the city, and enjoy yourself. Cause travel in a different country you can learn new thing that you never learn anywhere, or experience the thing that you learn in school like go to a history site that you learn from history class. Traveling is not all about playing around didn't learn anything, but you can have your choose of where you want to go, and what you want to do. There are one type of travel that I think is really good for student that they're going to have fun, experience, and still learning. It's the tour during summer break with your teacher, and your schoolmate. It's recommend by school where you can come to a country that you learn about their language, and culture in school. There are a lot of different thing that you need to get ready to go to another country, so you can't get everything done in a week of spring break. The second thing you can do by have a long summer break are spend time with your family, and friends. When summer come you, and your friends plan to go on vacation together because all of you have the same summer time even if ya'll come from a different school. Because all the schools doesn't have a same winter break, or spring break that is the reason why you, and your friends can't go to vacation together. Family is the most important thing for everybody. On summer you can spend more time with your family, or go visit cousin. Summer are the students break, but their parent still have go to work. The 3-4 week summer break is too short for students to have a chance spend time with their family. For overseas students that even worse they're study in a year, but still don't has a chance to come back to see their family just because the short amount of time that they have for break. The third problem is the student work on summer break most student are get their job during the summer. Because with the amount of time you available to work for them, they will hire you. For a student work in the summer is the best choose when you work on summer you can save a big amount of money to use during the year, and don't have to go work during school year, so you can be more focus in school. With a week off in winter break, or spring break you can't find a job because the short amount of time. Some people say their should be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and week off spring and fall. It's will help the student return to school without forgot everything that they have been learn. However I disagree with this idea I believe there should be a long summer break by that student can do what they want, and still learning new thing. I think a long summer break is the best time in a year for students travel overseas to study in the United State like me. Because this is the only time in the year we can come back to the motherland to meet us family, and visit cousin. During school year we can't come back to our country to celebrate holiday like Christmas, or mother day...etc. We have to celebrate a lone because the limit of the time won't let us make it home. A long summer break will help the student overseas spend more time with family because there are enough time for them to get ready, and travel a long way home. For students that live in United State you can go travel with your family to make more memory. When students have enough time to enjoy them self in summer it will help them return for school in a exciting way, so they can learn faster. ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5
D3D5841674F5,"Technology has positive effects on people's lives because they can help you with many information that your trying to look up for example if your trying to shop, play games, or even buy or read books. They help you do a lot when you really need it. Technology is not for only buying or doing any other things it's for doing projects in class or a if your doing your homework, applying for jobs, and applying for college. Here are my 3 reasons why technology is positive for people's lives.

First, let's say that you want to go to college but you can't go to the college because you don't have time or maybe that you just can't go. What you can do is that you can go on your laptop and go to the website and apply there and you can take your time on it and not have to worry about going there. You can apply to many collleges online and that is really great so you can get accepted to many colleges out in other countries or states. When my brother was in 12th grade he wanted to go personaly to the colleges but he said some of them were too far and that he didnt want to go because he needed to do something really important and so what he did was that he went online and started applying for 5 colleges and he got accepted to 4 of them. He said it was not even hard. Having to fill papers with people takes up so much time that you will be there the whole day instead of you doing it online at home and not having to rush up anything and if you mess up the laptop tells you that there is something that you typed up is wrong.

Second, If you don't feel like going to the store because your just tired and you just don't want to go out but you need some clothes for that night and you don't have any then what you can do is go online and start shopping there and buy everything you need for that night and you will be fine with out the need of going to the mall or going to any other store. At the same time even tho your not going out if you shop online there is a posibility that your clothes that you ordered does not fit you or it might not come on time when you really need it. The process of returing it and everythig is just too much. That's why people prefer that it's better to go to the store and just buy it from there. If that was me I would prefer to go to the mall or the store to. When you go to the stores sometimes you have to handle some workers that are aggressive and they have a bad attitude. I don't like seeing people with bad attitude it makes me mad and it always makes me just go away and not look at them anymore.

Third, In school sometimes you have projects and you have class work but you can't find information about your research or anything about your topic or about your class work then you have to find information online. When you ask your teachers what they would say is that go on your laptop and look it up and then go ask your classmates if you can't find anything. For my US VA History project are teachers gave us many different websites that we can use and they were very helpful I got all my information from there. I didn't even have to go ask him for help or anything. Also when you have test it's mostly technology because you don't really have test on paper anymore now it's on laptops and you don't have to write anything now it's only typed it is really easy and fast. Even essays it used to be essays on paper and now it's essays in laptops.

In conclusion, These were my 3 main reasons why technology has a positive effect on people's lives. There can be many positive effects on technology but theses 3 were mostly about how technology is even tho you do not interact with other humans face-to-face it is good doing online things. There are better chances that you get many things done and also you get the chance to have some time off of looking and talking to people. If I were to ask many people which side they prefer they would choose the positive effect side. ""It's better technology instead of talking to people"".",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
D401F5D87E45,"Dear Principal

The Police i think is correct is Policy 1. I think police one is correct because not only the students sometimes need to call their parents to come to pick then up or pick up early or come bring their lunch, but also because is impossible to make everyone obey Policy number 2, even if is a school policy most people will ignore it, so I think Policy number 1 is harder to be ignored. And even if we have a Policy against cell phones students would ignore it if is at lunch time because nobody is there to tell them not to use it, and the school already have to much to pay so the school would not pay someone to look at those students who are using cell phones during lunch. I think sometimes phones are problem while using during class, but if is in lunch or free time I don't see much problem, because you are not being rude, or interrupting anyone. So I think that sometimes phones are useful at school.

If we put policy number 2 at school it wouldn't make any bad things but students would still not following it, and lots of students would have their phone taken away or get in trouble because of their phones uses at school during lunch time or free time. So I think that school are a problem while using it in class but I think that is not bad to use it during lunch time or free time.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0
D4269468970A,"I agree with honesty because it's good to be honest and make people trust you and believe in you and because you have honesty it will get you friends and teachers will like you as a student. And also it is respectful to be honest and if it's your friend or family I think you should be honest because it's your friend and they probably wouldn't care what you say if it's mean because they probably know that you don't mean to be mean and that your just being honest with them.

But being honest is also not good because it can hurt someones feelings and can make them sad and not being honest could make you lose a friend and or make your friend happy. And if your not being honest and the person finds out you could lose them as a friend or they will dislike you a little bit.

But if i could choose both I would because it depends on the situation on why you have to be honest being honest or not honest could make someones feel sad or happy. And being honest or not could make someones day and make things better for them.

In conclusion:I say it would depend on the situation on why you have to be honest or not so that is what I think if you should be honest or not. But you have to be careful on what you say with honesty or not because depending on what you say it could be a big situation for you if you say something wrong.",3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
D45494CE3D2E,"Human survival depends on technology, we can not live without it. Technology is used in our everyday lives, from the very moment we open our eyes to the end of the day when we go into our sleep. Technology has really advanced a whole lot in comparison from the first telephone made up, to todays modern devices. Technology may have a negative impact to it, since technology is everywhere it is almost impossible to keep out of reach. Young children start to us it to early in life, they get addicted and they cry if it is taken from them. Technology may have that negative affect but it has many positive affects that come from it as well.

The beginning of technology all starts back when the first telephone was created by Alexander Graham Bell. The telephone he had created is much different from the ones you see today in everyday use by millions of people. His creation of the telephone was like a brick, very big and heavy. That device was more of a at home used only kind of device, not something you could easily just carry around with you. his invention probably was not the most popular right away since everyone was so use to living with out one it was not much of a necessity. As time progressed other inventors took Graham bells invention and invested further into it, adding and taking away things it had. For one the size and weight of it was changed by a lot through out time as well as the capability of what you could do on it. At first it was used only to transfer calls to communicate with somebody verbally without having to be face to face or even at close distance with them. Many individuals wanted to be the inventor of a phone and there are more than one, therefore because of this there are different companies, not just one that produces electronic devices. Around the early 2000's Apple, which is one of the biggest electronic device companies had released the first Iphone. Everyone and everywhere all around the world people were purchasing Apples new product. Throughout the years Apple has made so many products for people to purchase from cell phones,earphone, tablets, computers, watches, portable chargers, to just about anything for people to buy that they may use in there everyday lives.

Though all these advancements in technology may have caused some negative impacts in life such as that children from a young age get addicted from them it has also helped them. Parents have a big impacts in this whether they decide to hand their children a electronic or not, most parents that do let them opporate a device usually have limitations in what they can do or watch and for how long. Letting young children use this technology isnt all bad, there are television shows that help them learn their shapes, colors, objects, movements and simply learn how to communicate with others before entering school, nothing wrong with being a little ahead of others. ABC mouse is one of many great resources online that help children with their education and it is also done in a fun way for them to learn and enjoy their studying.

Technology is used by everyone all around the world and even out in space! Everything around us is being technologically used by us, inside of our own homes and outside. Security cameras, the thermostat that keeps us warm in the comfort of our homes and AC that helps us cool down on hot sunny days, the foods and drinks we store away in our fridges and freezers, WiFi box, T.V(s), door bells, all of that technology and thats just in our homes. Outside everyday technology would be like he vehicle we use to get to our jobs, the traffic signals, GPS to help guide use to get to our desired destination. You have a paper due or something you really need information on whether it is school related or not and the library is closed or you just can not get in reach of one you can simply do your research from any location you may be in with a click and swipe on a screen like your cell phone or computer. Machines are technology used like those in hospitals that are seriously used for human survival when someone is terribly injured or a new baby is born. Technology is still progressing and it will only become more advanced through out time, everyday inventors and scientist use it to make new ways to cure up diseases, find out where they come from and how they can be prevented.

The creation of technology on our world has been very helpful to us all in every way possible, without it there are many possibilities of certain deaths and accidents that could have occurred if it did not exist. The amount of advancement that it had gotten to will only help it get greater so we can be prepared for future tragedies that we would not want this world to face. Technology has been an extremely positive thing that has happened in this world for millions possibly even billions of people who use it.             ",4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.5,4.0

D579D6F26A91,"Have you ever wondered if you have extracurricular activities are getting in the way of your homework time or study time and if the activities you take should be up to the school or the student and his or her family? I'm going to explain why I believe the decision should be left to the student and his or her family memebers.

My first reason why I think extracurricular activities should be left to the student is because capable on choicen activities that would like to take and enjoy. For example if the school choices classes that you dislike and not enjoy you would have to be stuck with it. Also you would be very stressed that you're in that class and that stress can affect other classes in a negative way.

My second reason why I think extracurricular activities should be left to the student is because idf students choose to do more activities they gain more expirence in diffrent types catagories. This is a good thing beause it allows students to test the waters and find out what thy like to do so they can think about studying in college and persuing it. For example if you have more activities you have a way better chance to find something you like than less activies.

However, the school might say that if a student has more extracurricular activities it would affect the time students has for doing homework and studying. They also might say they know more about time managment but some students are fast at doing homework and are very fast at studying. So I think that the decision should be left to the student and his or her family memebers. The family and the student should know if they are capable to have many activities and still get their work done. That is why I believe the student should choose if they want to do many or little extracurricular activities. ",3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0

They will be discipline,and have respect of themselves and others example lets say you have a child is a minor and he or she breaks the laws and always gets in to trouble the military is one of things that will keep you discipline or otherwise they won't be well trained. The next thing I want to add is young people have to be shown and have experiences the a 10:pm weekend curfew is a descent amount of time to get them well trained other places like military, Juvenile, and like closing of businesses. Teenagers have a hard time staying in one place of a very long time with no free time a midnight curfew for teenagers is good for them so they can reflect and learn for their mistakes.

Some teenagers are committing crimes and getting away with it but this program well benefit them but in a matter time they will become good teenagers and obey the law. However, they will carry the behavior through their work place and public areas with good attitude and good behavior and it will never interfere of young person's live for example,lets say a job interview and the person who wants to hire you and he or she will see your characteristics and how many times you have broke the law and getting into trouble the person won't hire you can't get a job when you have a bad record of committing crimes and facing the law so, curfews are a good suggesting with young people that you can't say no to. However, another example is vandalizing when you harm someone's property without permission as an example like graffiti, braking car window's, and invading somebody else's property.

In conclusion, every teenager who brakes laws should attend to curfews for a beneficial life experiences so they can get the best out of them and they can prevent teenagers out of trouble.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
D5C8C29F17D8,"If school can offer options to students to finish school at home is great because they want students can learn and give them more opportunities. Students can be more benefit if they attend to school and they can learn more than to did at home. Also there are many students can't come to school because they have a job and they have to did school at home. Students are not that much of prepare if they did school at home. If students could attend to school it can be great for them to be more able to did more prepared them for the future. Also that can get opportunities if they attend to school and good reviews from teachers.

If students attend to school there are more ways to learn. Also students can be more able to ask more question to teachers. If they did classes from home that are not able to ask a lot of question and they can't met friend who can be a big help for them. If you attend to school also teachers can prepared you more and they talk to you if you did wrong in classes. All teachers in school i believe that they can see your capacity or level that you are and at home they just give you work and they didn't know anything about the student. The teacher at school can see the way that you better learn and they can work with the student to don't fell classes because the know you better if you go to school. Home school is a great idea for people that can't come to school.

In the world are students that can't attend to a school because they have a job or others problems to go to school. In the world is not only one single reason to don't attend to school. Many of the students that can't attend to school in the United States of America is because they work and this work can't give opportunity to attend to school. Sometimes they don't attend to school because is hard to work and wake up in the mornings to go to school. They also many times prefer to do school at home because they maybe have physical problems and they feel better if they did at home. Many students can't come to school but if they did at home this shows that they are planing to graduate even if they don't receive a good chance to learn more.

Students at home are not learning what they can learn in school. They are not very prepared if they did school at home because sometimes teachers give activities with friends and students can learn from that activities or presentations of projects that the whole class did it. School also you can practice more if you are learning and at home you can't practice what you learn. If you are learning English and you did school at home if they speak other language that is not English you can't practice it. If you did school at home there are also many distractions that you can't concentrate and if you are not concentrated in what your working on you are not going to understand what you are doing. If you are in a classroom teachers make sure that you are concentrated in your own work and they also make sure that you are doing right that why students who attend to schools can be more prepared than students who did school at home.

In conclusion if you have time and the opportunity to attend to school you should do it because you will learn and get more opportunities. If you can't attend to a school and you are doing school at home you must concentrated in your work and don't get distracted. Also if you are receiving school at home you must find some one who you can work with to practice. The opportunity that many school offer is a great idea. School wants to students can complete their dreams even if they can't assist to a school. But the schools are giving opportunities to finish at home and must students should appreciate that because school is thinking about the future of the society. In fact school programs are working for people who really want to have opportunities and make their dreams true.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.5
D684AE8A9418,"Many people are going say that we can be our self, but even though we can be as we want in certain things, our character is formed by influences beyond our control because we tend to try to fit in society, we fear making mistakes, and we try to be like someone we admire.

As humans we tend to try to fit in society; we like to feel liked by the people around us, so we act different than we actually are. The feeling of being liked by society in most cases makes us feel pride and self confidence, which is fine but makes a line between being our self and being influenced. Fitting in a society might be hard for some people,even frustrating, but people still are willing to do it so we can not be seen as different. trying to fit in a society might be the biggest reason why we do not act as we want and tend to act as everyone else in front of other people,because we fear that if society categorize us different then society is going to dislike us,however, there is some people that are careless of what people say about them. There is always someone that will not care at all of what people say about them which is good,but, there is always a time where they cared or will care about it. It is part of being a human that we care about what society says because we do not want be seen as someone different that can not fit. For example, students in schools dress as the trend is, so they can fit in society,even when they grow they will care how they look.

The fear of making mistakes influences part of our character. We fear that making mistakes will make us imperfect or not good at something, therefore, we think that if we are not perfect we are a failure,the fear of making mistakes is what makes us human, and that is a gigantic influence to us and we can not control it but makes people stronger and, help us to develop a character that will represent us in the future. we fear many different things in life for example,our appearance, if we think our appearance is not as we want, we get insecure in many different ways but, it is a huge help in the development of our own character because we learn from those mistakes. Being insecure is a huge obstacle and mistake for people to get to choose their own character, because it does not let us decide for what we really want,therefore people should learn from them which it will hopefully help people to develop a better character. Many people find themselves as insecure because of the fact that people might dislike them. Scientist have said that having the fear of making mistakes will make it harder for people to achieve their most wanted goals in life. We all as humans make mistakes, therefore we can not or it is harder for us to find our own character by our own self.

As humans we all have at least someone that we admire a lot,and we see them as a person we should imitate so we can be even a bit as them. Imitating someone in any way will make our self to struggle when trying to develop our own character because we are thinking of how someone else would think. Imitating someone else that has had such a great impact in life might be good for your self and you might achieve your goal because that person did. Even though our character is formed by influences of other we admire we also have to have our own character into it, so we can feel the pride of achieving a goal that has had our effort in to it. Having a bit of your own character into what you do is important too because it is not a full imitation of what someone else did. Many famous es have said that they also had followed someone else's steps to get where they are, so being influenced by the people you admire might help the people a lot to achieve their goals as it did with the famous people,and they also said that the people they admired a lot was the one helped them to find themselves, because if it was not for them they would have probably the same as they were before being famous.

In conclusion, we can decide how we want to be but that does not remove the fact that our character is mostly formed of influences that we can not control because we tend to try to fit in society,we fear making mistakes, and we try to be like someone we admire a lot. People are going to find themselves mostly from experiences and influences that they can not control,however you should have some of your own character to do things so when you achieve something important you feel better about yourself, but we,the people tend to act different so people like us and it is something inevitable,either control in life. As humans we dont like to be categorized as different and our main goal in a big percentage of people in the world is to fit in society and that is something that can not be controlled, but it helps us a lot to find our self afterwards and form our character at the end.",4.0,4.5,4.5,5.0,4.0,4.5

D7B9BEAEE50E,"Dear ; Mr principal i have done some resarch, and i think that it's a good idea to change the school cafeteria menu, to a more healthier food. I know that it wil be a big change, but it will help the students alot here in school, i have some reasons of why you must change the school menu and how it will help us.

The first reason is because the parents of the students won't have to be worry anymore of what thier children are eating in school, you know that there are some parents that want thier children to eat healthier, and if we change the menu they wont be worry all the time, because they will know that thier children are eating healthy food, every single day they wont be eating junk food.

My second reason is that the student will be heathy, and strong, they will also be more active, and ready to learn at school they wont be sleeping that much, and they wont be so lazy, because what the student are eating right now in school that is junk food it will make them, less active and their brain won't function good though the whole day. Thats why you should consider to change the school menu do it for the children that goes to school so they can be healthy and learn new things every single day.

My last reason, is that the student won't be geting sick alot, and they will coming to school more often, they wont be missing alot of school day beause of the healthy food that they will be eating from our school every day, we will also be helping their parents because when their children get sick they spend alot of money for doctor and medicine, but since we will be giving healthy food to the children they wont be geting sick alot. and we will be teaching them the importance of eating healthy food and being healthier.

This are my reason of why you should change the school menu so please consider this idea because we will be alot more healthier then what we are right now and our brain will functon good, and it will help us for the rest of our life, because in school is were we spend must of our time and we learn everything here, its like our second home do this for our future and for the good of the school.

D8D90E042134,"In my personal opinion, I think that students should decide on their own. I mean if they're eight-graders, they should be smart enough and decide on their own on what they want, or don't want to do. For me, I would choose helping the community, 'cause if you think about it, your actually doing it for your own goods, maybe in some points your not, but most of them from peoples personal experiment's basically, your doing it for your community and your country, the world and people that are around you. What i would do, I would make a list from easiest, to hardest on helping the community, and start from the easiest because at first, your not used to it, and you need to learn how to be responsible for your things, and for what you do. For example, I'll pick, helping students in your classrooms. Then, I might start tutoring my cousins or neighbors, something to start of with, like a practice. If I'll see or think that I'm good enough, I might move on, tutoring Elementary kids. Later on, I'll be a famous tutor! If I'll be doing a good job at tutoring, I might starting subbing for teachers, then they'll ask me to be a teacher! Which means, that now I'll have a job! So basically, I made my own personal carrier just for helping the community! What I'm trying to say, helping you community isn't as bad. If your one of the lucky ones, you'll make your self a carrier, if not, keep on trying!

D91D25F55AD9,"This world would never be how it is now if it wasn't for technology. Technology has made a big change to this world. Most people think it has made a positive change, and others think it's made a negative change. Technology has helped schools and business, but also has made some people's life impossible. So maybe, some people are wrong maybe having technology isn't so great after all.

Over time people stop talking to each other. Stop focusing in school, families, friends, relationships, All because of technology. If there was no technology there would be no social media. People see thing online that will make then mad and always want put it on other people and it all makes it a big problems. The relationships with those people then gets broken and never want to talk to each other again.

Before technology was created, families use to have game night, the whole family would all be at the dinner table eating their food and talking about their days. They would go on trips and have fun and enjoy their beautiful moments with friends and family. They would have a nice healthy sleep. Now it's all different. People get home from work to go watch T.V. or be on their phone all night long. People don't have family dinner anymore. This is a big problems that has effected a lot of people.

When I was younger I remember my parents giving me a lot of attention. As I started growing up it started to go away. We wouldn't go on trips anymore. We all wouldn't be at the dinner table anymore. Everything started to change, then over time I started to realize it was because of technology. They were just so obsessed with it, they never got off it. Then I got my first phone and I understood why they didn't come out of it. You always wanted to know what was going on with the drama, news, Facebook, Snap Chat, etc. That shouldn't be how this world should be running. God created this world so we can all stick together, be nice to each other, and care about each other.

If technology wasn't created then maybe everyone would be happy with their life's. Everyday would be a happy day for everyone. Even though technology has made some good impacts, I still think it would be better without it. Life will never be the same how it was before without it. ",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5
D949A947DD92,"Asking one person is great! Maybe asking your best friend for there opinion is great and all, but have you tried asking more then one person? However even though asking your friend is great, but have you thought about what other people may be thinking or there opinions on it? Wanting to ask your friends is nice of you, however they could be lieing to you about there real opinion. Therefor asking more then on person is better then asking just one, and you get honest opinions on what you may have asked about, or what you may have wanted to know about.

People think if asking more people for there opinions on what they asked about is better then just asking one person about there opinion. For example, somebody wants to know the best why to make some great yummy cookies. Nevertheless, there may be some times were when you ask people you may get a tie between the two choices, and if you do get a tie just go ask one more person for there opinion.

Many people ask more then seven to eight people some people don't have even numbers, however if you do get a even number there can always be more on one side of the vote or opinions. I was drawing in my note book and I finished a drawing, but for some reason I did not know what colors I should use. Then I asked my two sisters my mother and my father for there opinions on what colors I should use. Most of them picked the same colors, but my mother and my two sisters all picked the same color.

Therefor, if you ask more then one or two people then you can find out which is the most best out of the two things you wanted opinions on. Even though some times asking more is great you still have to pick which one you like the most if there were to be a tie and you don't want to go ask anymore people for there opinions about the topic if not your fine. Either way the most voted would be best, but if you pick the least liked am pretty sure that other people may not like it. Like my grandma used to say, ""more votes are more points in life"". There are most likely 10% of people who don't ask for others opinions, and 89% of people who go out and ask people for there info about the topic or there opinion about it.

Go ask your friends or family if they ever asked more then one person for there opinion. See almost everybody has asked if they haven't they well soon. My mother want's to get a tattoo, however she doesn't know which one she should get, and she doesn't want to get something that people or here kids may not like.

After she put the pictures of the one's she liked she then put then on Facebook to find out which one people like the most. Also I gave here my opinion as well, and now she has enough opinions and she knows the one she is going to get.

People now are smart and makes wise decisions on their daily basis. However, people tend to take risk upon their decisions without any consultancy with experts and authorities.

People should always seek guidance from experts and authorities whenever they are making any big decisions. It will be more easier for them to choose options when they seek guidance from someone who already knows about it. People often tend to make wrong decisions when they make decisions by themselves. A lot of celebrities have their personal guidance which is their manager. Manager makes a thoughtful decisions for celebrities to keep them on track of their career. If celebrities tend to make their own decisions many celebrities would go downfall in their career.

The decisions people make should be thoughtful and have guidance from experts. Christopher from into the wild book, he is one of the example for to take advise from experts or else people will end up like Chris. Christopher did not take any guidance from anyone while going into the wild of Alaska alone. He did not have any good materials to take with and didn't ask for help. MC candles died into the wild of Alaska because he was not prepared for the trip he was going into. This is exactly why people should take advise, if he would have taken any advice what so ever he would most likely have survived in the Alaska wilderness. He chose not to take any guidance which is the reason he died into the wilderness.

Everyone wants to have a successful life but not everyone gets it. If people wants to have a success in their life they have make right decisions or seeking the guidance from experts. There are only few people who people who succeeded in their career while making their own decisions even if they succeeded on their own they will need a manager to keep on track of their career. Person who seeks lot of advises from experts and authorities tend to be on advantages on their business. It will be more reliable to make a big decisions while seeking advice from expert rather than making it all alone. People are more likely to take a wrong decisions while doing it alone.

I think that it is a good way to influence other and guide them to a better way of thinking. so that they can understand the main point of the topic. My three reasons are guiding others,influening others, and sharing your thoughts.

Guiding other will make people believe in what you are saying and that will make you feel great because you are teaching other what you have been taught.

Influencing others can make others listen and hear what you have to say and then share it with others. Sharing there thoughts will guide people to doing good things in there lifes. Like buying stuff when they are old enough to. So when they go somewhere they would already know what there are doing.

Sharing there thought will help people to doing great thing in there life even though life is not always perfect you will have to make the best out of it.

7:35am again you lost the bus, according how you are, especially we can be lazy.

Especially always we need to be prompt because is necessary, in different place where you go. you need to be the first person, but no't the all peron are prompt, some people have a excuse,

but we can accomplish if you want, and if you can, also some people have a lot of things to do, but we can meke a calendar, and be more responsible, we can take the time for different things to do, also looking you watch or clock.

It brings optimism into your life, and makes it easier to avoid worries and negative thinking. If you adopt it as a way of your life, it would bring constructive changes into your life, and makes them happier, brighter and more succesful.

Whith a positive attitude you see the bring side of life, become optimistic and expect the best to happen. It is certainly a state of mind that is well worth developing.

Also a positive attitude leads to happiness and sucess and can change your whole life. If you look at the bright side of life, your whole life becomes filled with light. This light affects not only you and the way you look at the world, but it also affects your enviroment and the people around you.

If this attitude is strong enough, it becomes contagious. I'ts as if you radiate light around you.

When you are positive, you tend to pull yourself out of negative loop and don't lose focus from what you really want to achieve, the person with a positive attitude has a better perspective of life. understand that is important to take resposibility for one's actions for example: problems in your work, family, school etc. A strong sence of responsibility always envokes positive and constructive actions. A positive thinker is never impulsive, they always wait to get clarity of a particular situation.

Being positive and calm always enable you to see both sides of the coin.

People should considere setting their aim low so that they can star by reviewing the stuff that needs to be fixed,those are going to the things that are going to make you stronger and capable to lots of stuff.

The people that start the lowest are the ones that overcome their dreams,the ones that are capable,the ones that set their aim's low and achieve a mark. People overcome themselfs because of the mistakes that some people make along the way are the ones that help by building their character and makes themslef in a way stronger and more capable of lots of more stuff out there.

Some people will star high thinking that by doing that they would be able to get on top of stuff and all problems that are along with that are somehow fix without putting any effort or even think about it for a second,people should star a bit lower than that because that way they can work built that character that can help with achieven their goal by just putting a bit of effort and try to not aim high and fall short. For example a person that saids thats going to do lots of things riskign everything he or she may have a by just taking a single step loses it bacause of not being able to a list think before doing anything,by starting low can help not putting things and not taking any risk,by taking stuff step by step and learning things along the path.

Setting the aims at a low risk help with not losing what it was to hard to get or to achieve,by understanding that thats what help getting far in life and not let anything fall short and just taking the time to think and overview that things that are still around and star making them better and just work on them step by step. As some may say that its good for people to chalenge themself once in a while but without risking whats around it because whats the point of being able to work so hard and by just one step that was taking without having a chance to think of what was happening and lose it all by not taking it step by step.

My oppinion is that people should considere think before doing anything because that what helps getting you on the top and not just let anything fall down in front of your face,by thinking that to risk thing and not having to even think about it for a second was going to get you to the top,and if your going to chalenge yourself make sure to think about it stuff before doing it.",3.5,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.5
DB0A595A4723,"Dear Principal,

I write this letter to you because children are not suppose to perform community service. so sometimes children have time to do community service, and some don't have time to do it. For me I rather kids not doing community service because maybe they have better thing's to do. first of all, that kids have to do homework and important projects. secondly, children have the choice to do community service. finally, children have to do chores at home or help mom do something important.

first of all, kids have to do homework and important projects and that's because they have final project for the quarter, but you have to do community service what do you rather do i rather do my project for the quarter. Also homework is a important thing in your school grade and you also have to another community service again, and it is important too and that's why children are not suppose to take community service it take away to much time from important things like family, class work, and projects.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5
DB34A89420F2,"I understand why you want to add an hour and thirty minutes to school for kids to get more time to learn.

But think about the children may think its a bad idea and I agree with them as well. Why? you may ask, well lets think about it kids dont want to be at school for a very much more time in what they are already in for. Many students go to after school activities at certain times and get out later others dont but do some outside of school activities like sports, helping the community, getting chores done, {etc.}. You may seem like those arent important but for the students do think its important and also school, but the home work time they have left to do at home my not be a good idea on the different after school programs they may be in at different times when it starts and when it end times go fast and may not be time to go over homework or study for a test the next day. Education are good for the kids but getting low grades may not help them in the future and for the family. Many students wont have anytime to be spending with their family together any more with those times being spent on school and sports and other activities.

Families may think its a bad idea too add more hours to school and to take away time after school to get things done and to have time to enjoy with families at outside places at an restaurant or to go out for walks before bed times and the next day. While other parents my think if there going to add more time to school then students should arrive to school at least 20 minutes later for kids to have more time to sleep for an long school day, so they wouldnt be sleepy in the mornings. As may I think that over the week ends families like to go to far places and if students end up having projects and home work to do could effect the time with family and school and that wouldnt be so good for the students. Think about it kids not doing well in homework and test for not studying for not have any time after school for the extra hour and thirty minutes they are going to get that wont be good for the school county and less students would start coming to there schools and rather transfer to a better school with less hours or just consider home school and your school would have kids leaving and wont be able to have students to teach anymore. Witches end up shutting your schools programs and closing the school and there wouldnt be any jobs for teachers or you to find quickly enough to pay bills and rent witch wouldnt be so good for the employees.",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.0
DB69B98973B6,"One topic that is frequently debated today is if schools should be allowed to control students involvement in extracurricular activities. They think that sometimes students take too many extracurricular activities to the point that they do not have enough time to do their school work. They feel that extracurricular activities don't help students manage their time wisely. I believe the decision regarding extracurricular activities should be left to the students because it helps students learn how to manage their time, make new friends, and it helps students make colleges be interested in them.

Firstly extracurricular activities helps students learn how to manage their time. It helps students learn how to manage their time by making them make a schedule. By making a schedule students learn how hard it is to an adult. Students make resposible actions and learn how much work they have to put in for them to be good in school. Extracurricular activities doesn't always take studenst time but prepares them for life

Secondly extracurricular activities helps students learn how to make new friends. Extracurricular activities helps students how to communicate and make new friends while making good memories. Students shouldn't always be focused in school I believe that students should also have fun and friends. Friends will make school and other school related activities enjoyable for kids and teengers.

Lastly extracurricular activities helps students make colleges be interested in them. Colleges get interested in you when they see all of the thinggs you've done althrought high school. If colleges see that you've a lot throught high school they would be even more interested in you. Colleges also check your grades and other stuff but the thing they check the most is extracurricular activities because they want to see if you were consistant.

As you have read I believe the decision regarding extracurricular activities should be left to the students because it helps students learn how to manage their time, make new friends, and it helps students make colleges be interested in them. Only when we let our students choice they would resposible and wise. When that day comes our students will be great and mature.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5
DBC60BDBC49E,The school board shouldn't add one and half hours to school each day. To begin one reason i think they shouldn't is that a lot of kids who play sports or clubs after school might not be able to because they don't have time to learn about how life is and how difficult it is and people's life difficulties. One example is that some kids play videos and since they dont have lots of time out side of school they might just play video game instead of sports and if you give them more time out of school more opportunities students will have. secondly Students will be more tired and less focus because if students have more time in school the more earlier they will have to sleep and most students don't fall asleep early also students have homework since they well most likely be tired from school they might take a nap and there might either wake up to late to do homework or not have time to finish all there homework. Thirdly more students will not want to be in school and may drop out from either too much stress or they just don't want to be in school because the longer time there in school the more tired they are and less time they have to do what makes them feel relaxed or not have time to do what they love to do. students also might not have time to make friends because there focusing on school and it might ruin there social skill and conversation with strangers out side of school. Lastly less amount of time they have to spend with there families because they would have to go to school for extra time and as soon as they get home they have to do homework and honestly by the time there done there going to be most likely tired to do anything beside resting or sleeping. Also some students have younger siblings to take care of after school so that would put more stress on a student and either a family would have to pay for a baby sitter or some families don't have money to pay for one so parents might take there student out of school just to take care of there sibling and so the extra time in school wouldn't help him. To conclude those are the main reasons why I think we shouldn't have more school hours in school.  ,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5

You could also observed the extraordinary Cherry Blossom. You wouldn't want to miss this would you?

My first stop would be at the breathtaking sites. The white house is a really old house that was built a long time ago. All presidents of the United States have lived there except George Washington.

Next, i would visit some museums. In the

Air and Space museum you could have a memorable experience. You could learn about rocks from the moon and about the first rocket that was sent to the moon. Also you get to see the first airplane that was created by two brothers. In the art museum you have fun gazing at really good pieces of art.

Finally, taking a little trip to the Cherry Blossom wouldn't be so bad. Who would miss having a great view to relax? People that have been to the Cherry Blossom before has enjoyed a lot.

DC56EF65D59D,"""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm""

I agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success, the life consists in make mistakes, nobody is perfect, everyone in any moment of our life we failure, but the purpose it's stand up with faith and enthusiasm, and doesn't give up; failure is not something bad like many people think, that's the reason why too much people feel lees than other's, when they make failure's in they life, so we resolve our mistakes with sadness, without enthusiasm, or fear of what people can say, believe in yourself is the key of an better life, and failure in our life it's just the teacher of our own future.

Churchill's statement bring a beautiful statement of what successful can be signify in our life, so success it's something what everyone can obtain in any situation, however, it's the most wonderful opportunity for our own willingness,while, in my other hand failure means practice of our own future, because failure it's just the perfect manner to learn, to be better with the past of the time. How your going to teach your children's, if you didn't make mistakes? Failure make people with experience, ""if you don't make mistakes,you don't learn"" and you can't teach other people, when they are in warning to make the same mistakes that you did before, this is a great example of family, so you need to be the example of your children's helping to show the danger, but as well the wonderful manner to see the failure with enthusiasm to commence again.

The failure make better people? absolutely, because mistakes sample the things what we didn't wanted to see before; failure to failure probably it's tired, but have a great recompense; failure prepare our own life, for example if we failure the test, probably next time we are going to study better than the first time, but we get a great experience to see with better perspective than before. The point of failure is what we need to live failure in our own life, for understand and see with different perspective than before, failure create a maturity person with experience, and big knowledge;however this great statement it's a example of persevered,progress, and growth in our own life to get experience, maturity, productivity, and fortress.

My conclusion is basically in the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success, so make mistakes is no bad it's part of life, just don't give up and show that we can be better, we can do better than before;failure is the teacher of your future, don't be fear on what people can be say about your decision's, or you manner of see your failure, it's fine make mistakes ""we learn something new"",but it's important the manner that we see it, with enthusiasm or sadness?,because we continue,we start again,and we can get better results. Failure it's the experience of the teacher, of a persevering, progressing, and productivity person,life it's not perfect, but depends the perspective in what way do you see life, so"" we need to make mistakes to be the teacher of the tomorrow"".",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0
DCDDFA12E124,"We humans aren't really perfect, there hasn't been one human that has never made a mistake, for example the person that is writing this prompt, has had a decent amount of failures in his life. One time he was taking a really hard test like this one, but he didn't know that it was going to decide if he is going to attend college or not, so he just sat down on the chair in Generic_School Library and he began to take the test, he had to take another year of high school, but he figured that he doesn't want to fail this senior year.

If he fails again he has to graduate with a bunch of kids, that doesn't sound right, does it? i'm from a family that always want their kids to be a doctor or an engineer, and they want to show to other parents that ""my child is better than yours"". So they kept putting pressure on me for months and years but it didn't seem to help a lot, but I had to make a change one day not because I was trying to make my parents happy or impress the other parents, but I was tired, I was tried of not having respect in the family, like anything that i said didn't mean anything to them, so I had to change, and with that change came a lot of consequences, for example losing my friends, not leaving the house as much as I used to, working less so it means less money on my paycheck by the end or every two weeks, but i didn't care as much, because I knew that this is going to be my last year at Generic_School.

I will learn from my defeats, and make sure that they wouldn't happen again, like one time I was working at Panera, my main job, and it was still my training week so I had no clue what the names for the dressing and the food was, so there is this computer above every line that tells you what the name of the food is, and it tells you all of the ingredients in the food and what kind of dressing that salad or what kind of sauce that food needs, so I followed the ingredients on the computer but i had made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich before the order i was making, and the costumer was allergic to peanut butter but i didn't know that so i made their salad with the gloves that was contacted with the peanut, so I gave the salad to my friend to bag it and he asked me ""Hey Generic_Name! did u make sure to change your gloved after each order?"" and I said ""I'm sorry, I didn't know that i have to change my gloves every time."" he said ""It's fine, just change your gloves and make another salad."" after that i have always changed my gloves after every order.

By the way my side job is detailing cars at all in one auto group located in Generic_City, VA. It's not a really easy job, but the pay is good, $50/hour, for a teenager that's a really good amount of money and imagine me working every day for a year and working 5 hours every day, yea, that is a lot of money for someone like me, last year i bought a lot of stuff with the money i made, I bought a car, a new phone, a really expensive watch, and a bunch of other stuff that u get when u have a lot of money, they don't affect your life, but they are just there, for entertainment purposes, like who really needs to have a Nintendo switch and a ps4 at the same time, like what type normal person would do that, you only do this type of stuff when you have too much money, and having too much money and not knowing what to do with it is insane.

Me failing makes me stronger, it's like you are running a marathon but every time you fall u get faster and faster, you keep getting closer to the finish line, and that is a good thing, the finish line is where we all are going to end up, but it depends what u do during this race that decides if you are going to win or not, if you keep failing and failing and not learning from it then I feel bad for you, but you have to focus and learn and decide what is good and what is not good for you, you should not be distracted by the stuff around you and your life. humans are stronger that what they think, i read somewhere that humans only use %1 of their brain capacity, imagine the day that we all would use at least %50 of it.

If you ever feel like u have be defeated in life, you are not correct, get back on your feet and started working hard again, there no way that you would do something the right way and not get a good result out of it, it's impossible to do so, unless you are pretending that you are doing it, in fact that used to be me last year, pretending like i'm doing homework, pretending like i'm listening to the teacher, but where did i go with all of that, just because I was lazy and didn't want to pay attention, I lost the race, but I got back on my feet this year, and i'm making sure that i'm happy, more than anyone else, I'm not going to let any negativity impact my life.

My dad used to tell me, he still does, but he says that ""imagine you are a racing horse and you have covers on your eyes, so you would only see in front of you"", apparently it makes the horse focus on the race but he said that ""you have a lot of distractions on your way but focus on what you have to do and only that, nothing else. just keep running and don't let the distractions affect your life, if they do you will lose balance and either affect someone else or you are the only one that will fall over, and that is not a good thing.""

In general just focus on your life have fun at times but make sure it doesn't affect anything and if it does, make sure that you, with the help of someone else or by yourself can figure out a way to resolve the situation, sometimes it's a really good option to get help from the people that you know, like for example friends and family or even the school counselor or the principal, just get some help if you think that you can't resolve it by yourself. so the former British prime minister called ""Winston Churchill"" is right about ""success consists of going from failure without loss of enthusiasm."" I agree with his opinoin.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0
DD279F25DC1F,"""Oh my God Generic_Name,"" I did not have enough time to finish my power point, me too Generic_Name said. I think our school should add two hours more and we should come four-day school weeks like some businesses they work for ten hours and they only work four days it can benefits students and teachers because, some students can have more time to do their homework, some teachers and students can saved more gas and money, and some students can ask their teacher for more help.

First,students and teachers saved more gas and money. For example, my friend needs to drive herself to school everyday and she needs to pay for her gas. The other day she told me that coming to school for five days is stressful because, she has to pay for gas and she is not working everyday like she just too, so her parents have to pay the gas for her .They told her if she do not start to pay for her own gas they where going to take the car away from her, I told her about how some businesses have adopted just going four- days to work for ten hours and I told her that our school should have four-day school week too, I think that would be a good idea and she thinks that is a great idea too, because she gets to saved money and gas and she do not have to worry about paying a lot of money for gas anymore and her parents would not be mad at her anymore because she would have the money to pay for gas.

Other example can be my Spanish teacher she lives a little far from school and she has to drive to school, but she is having some problems and she does not have enough money to pay for her gas. She told me that if she do not get the money to pay her gas she was going to be absent for some day into she get the money to buy gas for her car, that make me so sad because she is my favorite teacher, she is like a mom to me, and she would not be able to come to school just because she dont have enough money to pay her gas. My friend told her about what I said and she things its a great statement because she would have more time to grade students homework ad would have more time to spent with her family.

Second, students can have more time to do their homework. For example, myself sometimes in my math or chemistry class we talk about something new and it takes almost the hold class and my teachers give us a lot of homework so I think the if we go school for ten hours it would be great because I would have a lot of time to do all my homework or I would have time to study too and I would just get home to relax and I would not get stress because I already did my homework.

Other example can be my best friend Generic_Name, she is taking all AP classes, and she gets a lot of homework sometime she does not get the enough time to finish her homework in class and when she gets home she has to take cared of her little sister, so she does not have time to finish her homework at home or sometimes she has projects do the next day but she does not have enough time finish in class. Generic_Name said that she gets really stress about all her homework and how she has to do it in so little time, she thinks if we go to school for more time she would have a lot of time to do her homework and she would just go home and take care of her little sister, she should not have to be stress about doing her homework.

Another example can be my friend Generic_Name, she loves to do homework because she likes to compete with other students, but ladle she has being so worry and angry about everything. I ask her why does not she compete with the other kids like she used to, she told me because she has a lot of test's coming up and she needs to study and that she wish that we have more time in school so she can get everything done the same day because now she has to take her homework to her house and finished over there, now she does not get time to relax and chill like she always did.

Third, some students can ask their teacher for more help. Like myself the other day in math class we were talking about a new topic it was so hard that I did not understand the topic. After the teacher show us how to do it, I was asking for help every three seconds because I did not understand, after she explain me for the hundred time I was still confused, before the class end she gave us homework I did not how to do the homework ether, so I stay after with her so she could it explain me again, but the after school time is only for fifteen minutes. My teacher explain me again and show me how to do it again but I did not get it, she told me the if we have more time in school hours it would be better because would take her time and explain us how to the work more slow, but we only have like one hour in her class so we do not get enough time ask a lot of questions. Other example, my friend Generic_Name sometimes his teacher talk so fast that he can understand what she is saying, he want it to stay after school so she could explain him again, but he could not stay because needed to go soccer practice he being missing a lot of day because he always stay after school with a teacher for extra help and if he does not start going to soccer practice again, his coach is going to kick him out of the team, he is the only one that has been missing a lot of days, and he needs to get back in track because his team has a really important game coming up, so he can not stay after school for help anymore.

Some students think that they get stress for being in school for a lot of time;however, they are wrong because some students think that if they go to school for a lot of time they would get more time to do their homework.

Some students and teachers get to saved more money and gas, some student can have more time to do their homework, and some students can ask their teacher for more help this are some benefits of why should my school adopt a four-day school week.",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0
DDC3C4A828DA,"It has been said that first imperssions are almost impossible to change, do you agree or disagree? In my past experience, I would highly disagree with this statement. When first meeting somebody, you don't always get the right thoughts about that specific person. Once knowing somebody personally your thoughts start changing, your mind starts messing up on thinking ""What should I think about this person?"". Due to my past experience I always have luck to my first opinion changing to a good opinion after getting to know them. I always ask my friends what were there thoughts of me when they met me for the very first time and all of my friends would always tell me that I look like I was mean and not very kind. After, they're opinions later changed once they got to me personally, knowing my personality and knowing how kind I am. My friends were very suprised.

Second, I would insists of not always having a first opinion on when seeing somebody for the first time because that usually is never how the person actually is. First imperssions always depend on the person on how there feeling or just based of anything that can be said.

Second impressions always get more better once they seen each other at least ones.

Third,

I would like to speak on my past experiences with this statement on why I disagree with this reasoning. When I was a couple years younger I had some very means thing said about me in middle school due to a couple of very mean people. Due to those sayings and rumors a various amount of people knew about me and the stuff that was said about me. People thought they already know me through thick and thin but in reality they really didn't. Once, I wanted to meet new people they never actually really wanted to speak to me or actually meet me because they already had there first impression because of the sayings. Later on, years started passing by and a few people started meeting me more and started speaking to me and once they did they noticed that I was very different person then what people would say about me.

In Conclusion, In my past experience I would highly think in my beliefs I would defiendely not based my first impression on somebody I'm just meeting. I like to get treated on how I treat others. First impressions are never good that's why it's never good to get based off that. You've read my about my past and now know why I don't go off that. If you ever decided to go off first imperssions and not change your mind about your first impression then good luck to you.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.5,4.0
DE0F5C13960F,"Have you ever wondered what it is like to have a homework club at your school, well its pretty useful. The idea is for kids to do their homework at school instead of at home, you can get help from a teacher and also work with your buddies.

One reason why I argue for school clubs to be available is because you it gives you time to do other stuff such as, spending time with your family,spending time with your friends,and even go to the movies. If you do your homework at the homework club you won't have to worry about due dates, quizzes, or tests. If you dont go the homework club you will always have tons of homework and not even do it which can cause your grades to fall down and probably not graduate if the required skills aren't meet.

Secondly, if you and your friend are in the same class and get the same homework then you can work on it together,check each others papers, and quiz each other on it. If you work on it alone you might get confused and frustrated, or maybe stressed, obviously copying one another does not make you learn anything, but there is a teacher who can help both of you at the same time.

Video games are very fun and addictive but you cant play if you got homework in the way. If you get you homework done then you have the whole day to play with your friends, communicate with them and even battle to the lat one standing. Some video games have blood, gore, and violence and some kids love those games which can be a small problem but not a big one, most parents can take devices and electronics away because kids dont do their homework so if you want to play video games and have fun you better go to homework club.

In conclusion the homework club should be available and going so that kids can finish their homework all at once and have fun in and out of school. Homework is really important and kids very often dont do their homework and thats probably the reason why kids hate school and do not want to got to school.

DEA1F417949A,"Did you know that people who stay out of trouble, have greater change of succeeding in life. So the city council should take step forward in to adopting the curfew law, because that would keep the teenagers out of trouble. Many teenagers follow the law, but those who do not will be breaking the law. This curfew law is going to help many ways, some teenagers stay out late socializing with they are friend; many times they are late to school the next morning. The benefits of this law would be that, it keeps the teenagers safe and out of trouble.

If the curfew is adopted, it is going to keep the teenagers out of streets late at night. Me and my friend sometime go to 7-eleven late at night during weekdays around 10;30 p. m. If the law was in order right now, we would be breaking the law. On the weekend some teenagers might want to stay out longer with they are friends: socializing, making new friends, and building a good friendship. But a law is a law, If you are still out on the streets after 12 a. m then you would be breaking the law and going to be in trouble.

This curfew law will set a boundary for teenagers who always come home late at night. This law might cut down little bit of they are freedom, but it is for they are own good. My mom always tells me to be home by 9:00 p. m on the weekdays, but I am always an hour late. When the curfew law is in order, my mom knows that i will be home by 10 p. m, because i do not like to break the law. It is better to be safe and out of trouble than getting in trouble and breaking the law.

Many people would disagree with the curfew law because some teenagers work and do not have transportation; they have to walk from work to home after those hours. There-for it is parents job to make sure they are kids make it home safe. As parents you never want to see your child in danger or in trouble on the streets. The city council should adopted the law in order, so the teenagers will be out of streets late at night and home safe with they are family.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0
DEC50B420484,"Think about the benefits of working with a group or working alone. Which do i feel is more beneficial?

Well working alone get you more focus and not playing around. If working with a group it will be different then working alone, because you can work faster or get the answer of them and be a great group to past the class and work on it but working together as a group it will be hard not you not gonna focus too because they gonna be playing around and not pay attention to what the teacher is saying in class.

Some people wanna work alone or work as group and the reason why people want to do that because working long they can focus and not play around, and working as a group people are gonna work together just to play around and not be paying any attention just being in the phone or talking.

Teachers need to do something about working together as a group because they just gonna goof around and not do there work they just gonna be talking and being on their phone. I feel like people need to work alone so they can focus on there work and be paying attention to the teachers and do there work. I don't think people should work as a group. At the same time people should work as a group because they can help each other and give answer to each other ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5
DEDD5C568B4C,"I agree with being honest at all times because you need to be honest with your true friends, you need to be honest with your family, and you to be honest with yourself.

The first reason you need to be honest is with your true friends because your true friends are going to want you to tell the truth to them.

Your friends always check on you to see if you are okay and tell you how is your life so far .You got to tell the truth to them because they really care about you a lot. For example, what happens if you are in a bad situation like being chased by a stranger and you told your friend to call 911 because you are being chased. The police got there in time to arrest the stranger who was chasing you. You see, friends care about you and for your safety as well.

Your friends will always got your back no matter what happens to you or them.

Your friends just want to hangout with you have fun .

The second reason you need to be honest is with your family . You got to be honest with your family because you got to tell them the truth of what is going on in your life. What happens if your Mom or Dad are calling you while you are walking to school with your ringer cut off. They just checking on you and for your safety. Your does not want you tell them lies cause sometimes kids do not want to tell their parents what is going on in school. You never know when they are getting bullied and being harassed.

The lesson of the story is that always be honest and tell the truth with your family.

The third reason you need to be honest is with yourself at all times. You have to trust yourself because you never know what is going to happen to you. For Example, someone is selling drugs in school and he told you that you want some drugs . You have to think is this going to kill me or just say no. In my opinion I would say no to person who is selling the drugs. This actually can happen in real life . If you were in that position just say no or make an excuse . The lesson of the story is always be honest to yourself. ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0
DF74545A44C8,"The great artist Michelangelo once said, ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.""

This is mena that people setitng their direction to high they falling quick, but they setting their direction too low that achieve their mark.

For my opinion, people set their aim as high as they can, because they know that if they set too low; they won't have that power to finish or to get it. This made people thought their aim is high; they need to work harder not just the 100 precent they need to put more than 100 precent into it and get thieir aim. Not all the people can reach as high as they set, but at least they try eventhought they fall they still on a good postion. For example, I have a quze total points is 100 and I try to get the full points, but in the end I only get 85, it's still good, because I know my aim is high, I need to do hard. When people set their aim too low, they won't have that power to finish it, because you know that it's easy to get it, and you don't even have to prepare or try for it. This make you don't know what you really want and need. It will let you just stuck there. From my opinion, I really agree Michelagelo's satement ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.""

In my conclusion, people should set their aim as high as they can, eventhought they cannot reach it, but at least they try it, but don't set a easy aim that you don't even have to try your best to get it, this will not improve yourself. ",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.5

Many people today likes give advises to others, sometimes about their life, work or personal relationship. But the question now is, ''Example is not the main thing in influencing others; is the only thing? I think it is, for two main reasons.

Fistly, When you talk to others, you sometimes gives a example about other people experiences. For example, someone who was a bad person in the past and now he change. You can change bad relations or yourself . You are influencing that person with reasons, examples and actions, he can change himself. If he wants.

Second, always we influenced people with reasons, maybe bad reasons or good reasons but is the only way to influence others. Influence people is not easy, you need to be prepared with the examples they need to ear.

DFB7AB4481AC,"I think that people can success without having the cosists of failure without loss of enthusiam. There's other way to success without failing, one of them is to practice. An another way is sometime you can get it on your first time without have to fail. Then you can just study other's failure and not make them same mistake, or sucess and try to do the same. These are other way to success without having to fail, and they are maybe more ways also. So Winston Churchill isn't wrong, there's still other success with out failure.

First you can practices, practices makes you better that thing to want to success with. It like you can't success to be the best soccer player if you don't practices. So instead of taking the test or what ever if you practices, you might not fail, you'll be ready for it or good to do it. If you want to success in a sport, you can success by practicing you can build mussel memory that can help you in many ways. If you want to success on a test you can practices on practices tests, that can help you out. That one of the ways you can success without failure.

Also you can success by getting it are on you first time, there's some time people do will on their first time without having to fail, practices, or study. They are mostly lucky when that happen, and it does happens much, but they still success. Most people like to call this, winging it, some people might success, and some might not but that a other way so still success. it might be the best way success, but might have done it and success for it.

Another way people can success, is by watching other's failure and success. When you watch other's failure you can study and try not to make the same mistake as they did. So if you saw some player or some slowed down when they were about score, but they miss or someone block them you can say, ""they shouldn't have slowed or whatever that would have help them. So when it your turn you can try to not make the same mistake and success. You don't just have to watch their fail, and can also study their success and try to do the same thing. So by watch others people success and failure, you can copy their success or improve their failure.

So Winston isn't wrong you can success form your failure. By look on your mistake and improve them and making you'll self better, at what you have trouble at. Failure without loss of enthusiasm is better then getting so mad about it and might make it easier to success next time.

So I don't agree with Churchill's statement, because their is more then just failure to success. There's so much way to success with having to fail. You can practices, study other's failure and success, and sometime success on you first time by winging it. So those are some reason, why i don't agree with Winston Churchill.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0
DFCF2A3BE972,"The program that the school provides for attending classes online could have a positive outcome or it could have a negative outcome. Different school have different ways of doing things. Some school don't provide this type of programs, in others do. Different type of people have different type of view of attending classes online. People would agree that is a good idea but other would say its bad idea. Having online class you don't have to wait for other people to finish. You could do what pace you want and to do your classes. It could have a negative part to attending online school. Your WIFI could go slow or not work at all. Having a hard time to achieve the work. Not having a different environment with people with the same age. Not doing the work that they assigned you.

When a student have class online they could find it defalcate to achieve the work that they been assigned to. You would not be able to ask question about the problem. Would have to figure it out by your self. Some online website would not help you to achieve what you are looking for. It could give a bad answer and then you got the whole assignment wrong. In videos you could find ways to achieve it but sometimes there is not a lot of videos on things that you are looking for. If you where in a class room you could ask a teacher to show you how to solve it and you would probably would understand it more. In online school sometimes there is no teacher available at the time when you need them. Sometimes student don't have the time and sometimes they don't turn in there work on time. Would just put it to the side and say"" they would probably do it later"" and never do it. It could be found defalcate to achieve the work on time.

When you so round your self with people that are the same age. You could have study patterns and you could ask them for help. Doing online school its just you and the computer and the class you are taking. Probably have friends but they mite not be taking the same class as you,would not be a able to work together or study. Doing online school would maybe not have time to socialize with new people. You may work or do other things but most of the times they could be older or you just don't talk to people a lot. Having different environment could help you to learn more and plus you would not be by your self. Have other people with you in the same room. Not just you home by yourself with a computer. Having classes online you would not be sou round with people your age.

Doing online class sometimes could give out a lot of work to do in one day. In the same day you have to turn it in. It could be challenge when you dont know what they are talking about or you just don't understand it. Doing your work is one important thing to do, to understand the class and what its teaching. Not just going online to find something that kind of looks like the work and you just copy it down. Sometimes student could get lazy and not do there work. Would probably leave it for the last minute to turn it in. The laziness of student could end up with no good grades or passing the class, would take the class all over. You could get distracted really fast with other things that is going on in your life. Not doing the work, it would not take you no where and would not finish the class on time before the due date.

The school would give different ways for student to attend class. It could be online class or going to a classroom in a school. It would be helpful for student to attend more class and probably have more free time. Sometimes student could take advantage on this program to just stay home and do nothing. Life could be hard sometimes and you could go through things that you don't expect to happen. It could be defalcate when you don't know the subject and there is no teacher around to help you. Students always choose whats right for them. Attending classes online could be defalcate to achieve. Would not be sou rand by people their age and probably not do there work. Attending classes online dose not always work out for students.    ",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
E03B0AA78E40,"Committing to a job at a Young age is bad and good idea, why you may ask? Well at a young age you might have a fantacy and a very huge immagination well at least i did, as a kid this could help because if you commit to a career at young age. When you're older you'll be an expert and know the job by memory. Having to commit to a career at a young age can save you time in the future, when you have graduated you would automatically have a option and know what job you are going to do. This can also be a terrible idea because at that a young age you don't really know what you want as a career, you just go with what ever your parents or the person you look up to does and as you get older you relize you were not really into that career. Your brain also isn't fully developed until you're older it is a proven fact.

Having a fantacy and a very great immagination is good because it can motivate you to choose a good carreer which you would obviosly enjoy in the future. May aslo be a bad idea because when you get older you learn to hate things you enjoyed as a kid and it would just leave you with a career you cant enjoy as much as you use too. For example when i was a kid i enjoyed to play Football i always thought i would do it until i died. As i got older i began to hate it, because it wasn't really what i wanted to do it was what my dad wanted me to do which i enjoyed because it made him happy. Now i know i want to travel the world and be a Photographer and learned to speak up for myself and it helped me to communicate with my dad and be straight forward with him there for kids are confused at a young age.

Reasons why commiting to a career at a young age is a good idea. The more you get older the more you know about the job so you'll be a wealthy man getting paid good by the time you are twenty five. There for you wouldn't be worried and freaking out about what career you are going to do after school you would already be prepared mentally and physically.

As a kid you enjoy whatever your parents are doing, so you would obviously choose a career to be with your parents and thats a good thing as a kid. It'll make the job easier, funnier and more comftorable.

""In some societies, students are expectected to identify a career by the time they enter high school."" Personally i think Choosing a career at a young age is a bad idea, because like i said it is a proven fact that your brain isn't fully developed at a young age. That can be a bad idea to choose a career at a young age because you can choose a career you know nothing about, which means once you learn the job you might not even like it as much as when you first chose it. For example let's say Your father could be working as a construction worker and because he does it you might chose your career to be a construction worker. When kids are young they like what others like its just how society makes you think, as you get older you become wiser and realize thats not what you actually want to do. There for you should not choose a career when you are in high school and just enjoy your school year's once you graduate you'll regret it and wish you had just relaxed but that does not mean you should'nt plan for upcoming careers you should have more than one option, prepared for after you graduate.

E06EDBA28C44,"Some people say that aim too high is not for them. This should be because people does not feel ready. Some people would want to aim high, but they do not want to know how would be the outcome. Although, some people think that aim too high is a waste of time, nevertheless, humans really need to set their aim too high to know if they would achieve their goals because some humans thinks that they are not prepare to aim too high and fail and some humans prefer to aim low and achieve their goals.

My first reason is that some humans thinks that they are not prepare to aim too high and fail. For example, if a person aim too high but fail that person would not feel good about him. Some times people who fail get depressed. If that is a humans who is a persistent person he would be trying more time. Until that person achieve their big goal. Also, that kind of people who are persistent that always keep trying that people one day they achieve all their goals. In addition,

the key to have a awesome overcome is to never give up and never stop.

My second reason is that some humans prefer to aim low and achieve their goals. People who do this are people that always want the easy thing. These people does not want to effort that much and achieve their goals. However, these people do not know the significant of have something that took a lot of efforts. In addition, some people may say that if they aim low they can achieve more things in the time a person that aim too high. Thats not the point, the thing is that every human have to effort to know the significant of never give up. Also, when humans has owned something by their own effort the valuate more what they had achieve.

In summary, humans really need to set their aim too high to know if they would achieve their goals. Some humans thinks that they are not prepare to aim too high and fail and some humans prefer to aim low and achieve their goals. Also, on these latest years humans has been lazy than doesnt want to effort to do big things and achieve it. Now humans really needs to efforts for something.

For example I met my best friend other friend, the first time I saw her other friend I instantly like her. She was so sweet always giving me a good energy that I want for a person. She was so kind and love to smile, and she dress neatly. Her smile effect me she makes want to me smile, from that moment on I know that her and I could get a long.

Another example my seatmate, my first impression about him was a good one. Because he was just calm and his attitude is the same as mine. I see myself in him, him and I just get along well and his giving a good energy that I like for a person.

Another example first day of our club meeting, my club teacher paired me to someone that I don't know, For us to know who are other club members are to know each other.

E12401B92C3B,"Some people want to be the best example in life; however, not all of them can be. Even the most famous and intelligent people that we can know is not the best example to follow because if we go and investigate their life they also have done things wrong. Everyone makes mistakes and is alright in this world. I disagree with what Albert Schweitzer said. In fact my personal conduct is not the best way to act for other people to follow me because it is difficult being a good example and is better if we influence them differently.

To begin it is difficult being a good example. Everybody does good things in their life; however, there are some days where we do not feel good and by accident or because we want to do it, so we do things not right. For example: I do not like when my aunts talk to their daughters about me. My aunts explain them that I am a good example in my family because I have two jobs and I go to school and in my free time I prefer to stay with them at home than going out with friends that they do not know. I know the things they say are correts but I told them do not use me as an explample because now I am like that, but if tomorrow I decide to quit school or I do other things is not going to be the best example they are waiting for. Some might say that it is easer having jobs and going to school and being a good example in your family because there are many people who does the same, but I know in reality is very difficult mostly if you are helping your family too.

Next is better if we influence them differently. Not by being their examples but being as a guide to follow. For example: I have an aunt who had her first kid at her 14 years old. Now she is 30 years old and she does not have more babies just the firt one. She tells to my cousins and I that it was the worse experience that she has not for her child but for her husband. She remembers everything that she lived at that age and how she had to deal when she can not have her baby because she was young and her body was not completely develop. Later for her surprise she had to work and maintain her child and her husband because he did not work or do anything. Now she cries when she tell us her stories, but my aunt says that she wants the best for us and she does not want it to happen to us. My aunt says that she is not the best example in our family because she did not obbey my grandparents, but she has learned many good things in life base in her experiences. Some people may say that they are the best examples for their children even if they do things not right in the past, but I believe that we learn from those mistakes but still we are not the best example because we already did bad things.

In conclusion being an example of our own behabior is not the best way to influence people! There are many different ways to influence others as you know it is difficult being a good example and is better to influence people diferently. There are many occacions where we recognize that we do great jobs in life, and people have to see us like good examples. However; people can see us like good examples but not to exaggerate because some people think that just because they do something good they are the best. And I know they can think that because every single minute in our life is count it and also challenged, and we do not want to waste our time.",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
E19CE100743C,"""Getting something by doing something or doing nothing also bring us something""

We accomplish more if we are always doing something ,because if we do more than what we want or have we will always be growing ,everytime that we do something no matter what it's we receive something back ,many people called ''reward"" , when we want something and we work hard to get that, we create a confidence in ourself's that we now that by doing something we can get what we want and we motivate ourself to accomplish that. we get more if we do more ,but some people think that by doing nothing you can get something back . accomplishment is something that you get by working hard , giving your best ,and by doing something about it , if we dont do anything we aren't going to accomplish anything or get anything in this life .

We accomplish more by doing something, because if we do more than what we want or have we will always be growing more. like one time I remember that I was in six grade and I really wanted to participate in the math competition that Generic_Name prepare every year ,only the fastest student's in math can participate ,so Generic_Name tell us that they were math reviews after school to practice for the competition ,but I didn't have the opportunity to stay in does reviews ,because every day in the after school I had swimming practice and I couldn't skip because my classes were already paid , so I remember that I was sad and I start thinking that if I really wanted to be in that competition I should do something to be there ,I start to wake up two hours early in the morning and I would practice math and also I will go to the library in lunch to work on math exercises ,but that sacrifice was worth it because when Generic_Name make the list for the people that would be able to participate in the competition my name was there. My mom always tell me that no matter how many times you fail in getting something , because the next time that you tried you wouldn't do the same mistake twice and at the end because of your effort and hard work you will accomplish everything that you want to make in your life. that's something I will remeber the rest of my life.

We get more by doing more ,because every single time that we do something ,no matter what it's we are going to get something back ''recompense''. when you take your time to do something with patience , will ,and gratitude that can benefit other people by not expecting something back ,we have that selfsatisfaction of making someone happy. like when you see a poor child walking in the streets ,looking for food in the trash ,bacause he is hungry and he doesn't have money to buy some food or maybe he doesn't have a mom that can feed him and you know that you can make that kid happy by giving him some food , because you have that feeling of helping him and make him happy once. one time I remember that I went with my mom to work , we went to clean a house of a 79 year old woman that the only company that she had was her dog , so I remember that I ask my mom if I can come the weekends to her house and join her during the day , and I didn't know that this woman would became someone special for me. she was very sweet ,kind , and lovely woman that i have ever meet in my life , she use to call me grandaugther and I was so happy to get the opportunity to meet her and when the time pass; her son that lives in Generic_City came to country and decide to take her with him and when the moment to say good bye comes, I was really sad because I would not be able to see her again ,but after she left I would always remember the words that she tell me; ""I'm living ,but dont worry because you would always be in my heart ,and i will always have in present everytime that you spend with me and make me happy."" that day I learn that when you do something no matter what it is you will always receive something back and that something it can change your life forever.

We get more by doing something ,because if we want something and we work hard to get what we want , we create a confidence of ourself, that we know that no matter how hard we have to work to accomplish that ,if we put our effort we can get what we want. like when you are at school and you have alot of assigments to do ,but you still motivate yourself to complete everything that you have to get done and you make the effort to continue until you are done, that's when you realize that you have that confidence of knowing that "" if you purpose yourself you can do everything "". confidence is something that is going to help you in every situation that you are in , it would help you when you are struggleling to take a important decision that maybe it can change your life. I remember when my sister was confused , because she didn't know if she would be able to accomplish the career that she wanted to take in college, and since that day I admire her ,because she believe herself ,she take the career and I knew that she knew that confidence help her to continue fordward and to accomplish what she already know that she wanted ,but at the same time she was scared of taking the challenge and fail. Sometimes we have to take that fear of failling out of our lifes ,and bring that confidence that would help us to belived in ourself's.

Getting more by doing something, is better than don't do anything expecting that we are going to get something.

By doing something we will always be growing more than what we are , we would always receive something back and that can be the happiness of another person's , and we would have that confidence to believed in ourself knowing that we can do everything that we want if we work hard for it. It's important for people to know that in this life they can have the opportunity to accomplish everything that they want tio improved their life ,but also at the same time they have to know that to accomplish something they have to work hard , have confidence, and they get everything they want in this life.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0
E1CAFEEB258E,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson, have's kind of a point about the world trying to make you something else.

My point of view is that we all have choice's we make to better our selves to make us better people in the world but some of the choice's we make as human's can lead us to a wrong path. We as people have to set goal's for the future and plan ahead to accomplish them. One thing i learn while being incarcerated you got to value yourself more than you value other's, if you dont value yourself what's the point for setting up goal's if all they going to do is collect dust.

Everybody haves different opinion's some people might think the world is at fault for the choice's they make and thats not true, people blame others when they know their in the wrong or done something wrong than try to say it's the other person's fault. I'll say is, with everything going on in the world we got to get together and help each other more and come together as a team NO! more as a family, when one of us fall down we lift each other up, if one of us get's hurt we heal each other. There's got to be thing's we can do, hard time's dont last forever at these moment's we got to remember how far we come from hard time's when things didnt look good for us. The world can try to charge you, it can try to break you, it can throw you to the side but the goal's you set up and the people by your side will help you complete the dream's and goal's you wish about.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
E1E09D32484D,"Do we choose our character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control? Some believe people choose their own character traits and who they want to be. Others believe that our character is formed by influence. I think we choose how to make our own character traits and we choose the attitude we want to give to others. This is important because our character is what represent us and is what makes us responsible for the person we chose to be.

First, people have the power of choosing who they want to be and producing their own attitude. For example, characteristic is important because is the quality, or property of us and it is what makes us committed to keep moving on the person we chose to be and different from others. Furthermore, I believe that people should choose their own character traits even though if they think that is formed by influences beyond their control. Perhaps some people should do the effort to change it because not everyone have a good and nice character.

Additionally, a person's personality is the collection of emotional and behavioral traits that characterize them. Personality and attitude is the key to be a role model for others to become a great person and care more about whether we choose wisely our character we're giving to other peoples. People's humility and kindness is priceless. Personality and attitude is what represents us and what makes us noble. For example, people can think that our own character traits is formed by influences but they still change it and do the effort to be a better person everyday.

However, not everyone agrees with this position. Some people claim that our character is formed by influences beyond our control. If we do not choose our character traits and they are formed by influences beyond our control, it might have its disadvantages.

For example, one must consider that there are people who have a bad character and end up alone because of their attitude, also their character can brings other people displeasure and make them go away and not get close to you just because they think you will never change your character but our character will be what we, ourselves choose to make it.

In conclusion, I think choosing our character, personality, and attitude is what makes us a humble and noble person to look up. I also think that some people should focus on the attitude they are giving to others and analyze if its what they would like to receive from someone else and if it brings them displeasure, perhaps it encourages them to change a bad character for a good personality and attitude.

E1EC4869981F,"The decision that the principal made that students should get involved in the activities is an unethical idea. Who would like to waste their time doing something that is not really beneficial? At school students have a lot of works to do, and now being in another activity might have a bad affect in their academic goals.

If a student get involved with the activities they wont have time for there daily work. They will have less time to do their homework or projects. This can keep students away from their academic goals. They also wont have much time to spend with family. which means that there will be problems with those relationships, and there will be separations between there family.

Getting involved in these activities brings stress for students. There will be one extra program added in their daily routine, Which contains more work. The work that they didnt choose to do, but the have to do. By having stress after this much work students wont get enough sleep, Which is an unhealthy situation.

Having this much pressure can affect students's grades. By spending their time on something that they dont really want to do, but they have to can put them in a lot of pressure which keeps them away from what they want to do. They will join these activities and wont focus on their studies. Students will start getting bad grades.

Will i disagree for being honest at all time. You don't have to be honest all the time it might hurt them but they need to know the true. For the person who have to tell them the true is hard for them because they don't know it might hurt there feels or might lose there friendship and maybe not forgive them.

To contact people, persons have friends and family that are in other countries or states that they can not see them but can talk with them by technology, is using technology to meet new people and be more social, and it is easily to contact with friends and plan to hangout with them.

Some jobs and companies need the technology for; save information about its costumers as their names and orders, to organize documents that can be important to the company. and to contact with the workers more quickly or let them know what they have to do next day by calls or emails.

E31B2A06C28C,"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key success in life, that having a good thinking about what you do, and be proud of it is important. Well, in my opinion it is the only thing, because time is going forward, and not backward, things that you have already done cannot be changed, but by having a good attitude about it you change your future, like being successful in your goals, solve economy issues, and even in day to day life.

A positive attitude is really important when it comes to achieve your goals, if you want something but you think you can not make it, it is because you do not have enough attitude, in order to be successful with it, you must forget all the negative thoughts, and believe in yourself, and after all the effort you have been giving you will be a little bit more closer to achieve your goals.

Sometimes money can turn your life real hard, it can make you stop trying for what you want, and make you give up; is in this kind of situations when a positive attitude must come in, let me give you a personal experience: I used to live with a stepfather, my mom, and five brothers. At that time bills and debts were easy to pay, my stepfather was making around $3,400 dollars a month, my mom like $1,300 dollars a month, and my brother and I around $800 dollars a month, all these money was the house income, but after my mom and her ex husband divorced, everything changed, now we had all those bills on us, but because we did not give up, and we had a positive attitude about the situation, we started to work even more, now my mom is single, and we can make trough out the month.

Another good example is living every day with a positive attitude like at work, at school, at home, even restaurants, it does not matter where you are right now it is important to always have a positive attitude, it is crucial in life to be proud about what you are, where you are, how you are, be the one who makes the change.

Some people say that because you did something wrong in the past, it is impossible to make a change about it, but they are wrong because they might not able to change the past, but for sure they can change the future by fixing and understanding in what they have failed, the attitude is important be proud of everything you have done and do not be ashamed.

In conclusion, it is really important to have a positive attitude because to be able to achieve your goals you must have to have a positive attitude, money can make it hard for you to live, but you have to think and analyze the situation, wherever you go remember to have a good attitude about yourself, and never be ashamed about something you did wrong remember that you always can make a change, only if you have a positive attitude.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0

If younger and older students get paired together it would have a good effect on students because they can learn different methods of learning, give advise for what do expect in high school, and learn different ways of managing stress.

the first reason why it's a good idea to pair older and younger students together is because they can learn different methods of doing things. older students can show the younger students there ways of learning. younger students can ask questions when they don't understand something on their homework, and the older students can show them how to answer the questions and show them their skills. Other thing is that the students can show the younger students short cuts on any subject they need help with. When the older students show the younger students their ways of learning it will help them when they don't understand something.

The second reason why is that the older students can give advise for what do expect in high school. They can tell the younger students how much homework they will have and how hard it is. They can also tell them what classes they might enjoy. They might enjoy theater or cheer. The younger students can tell them what classes they want to try out. Other reason is that they can tell them the skills they should and need to known. it's a good idea to be prepared for high school and the older students can help them with that.

Finley the older students can show them how they mange stress. They can give some advise on how they take a test. they can tell them their test strategys. Other thing they can do is show them how to prepare for a test. older students can show them how they study for a test. and the last reason is the older students can tell them how they mange there time. they might tell them them what time they do things and how they sent up their work space. when the students known some ways of managing stress it will help them in high school.

thesis are all the reason why it's a good idea to pair younger and older students together because students can learn different methods of leaning, get advise for what to expect in high school, and show them different ways of managing stress. when older and younger students get paired together it's a different experience that is good to have.

Kids who finish high school, in four year they're going with knowledged that they know better than other, some high school's have programs three year until two years to study, but in some high school's it is necesary make four years for wherever reasing or for that is traditional four years as well one motive is because student after graduate they will go to work they don't go to college and that's why they took three years.

For example one's of my friend's took three years and her sister took two years my friend's who took three yaars she said that her don't have the opcion to take elective classes for the simple reason that her will graduate in three years from high school.

Occasionally teenagers look for ways to spend time doing what they like. In fact, there have been many cases where teenagers use a sport to feel less stress or to spend more time with their friends, for these reason teenagers should be able to participate in extracurricular activities. Recently researches discovered that kids that are more active in their life-style can concentrate more than kids that stay in their houses doing nothing all day, like when

Generic_Name was practicing the sport she start making new friends and loving the progress she was making every day.

Also I've done projects on my own and it takes a lot of time and a lot of effort to finish it and turn it on time. Needing a group would be helpful not just for me but for everyone who is in it because by doing together we would all get a good grade.

Doing your project wont take as longer no more because we would do it in groups. For example, doing your stuff takes to long when doing it yourself . As in doing it all together it would be much faster. Everyone would take a part to do of the project and put it all together. In a group everyone would put a part of there assignment they have done to pull in the whole project together.

There was this one time we all got to pick are group to this big project about the earth we all got a part we want to do. We had to full weeks to turn it in but because we all did want was assignment to us we finish in a week and turned it in and got ""A"" for our project. In for all doing it in group would be much faster.

The first reason is that some people are avaricious, is a bad influence for the people that want grown in the jobs, school and in the milieu family, for example my brother not finish the school, Because He like the money and He think the best solution will be leak of the school for work more and have more money.

For instance, doctors they have an opportunity to keep a person alive. They do all of that because of their adorable attitude; and care a lot about another people's life. Small thing can make a difference in the world.

Nevertheless, some people say a positive attitude is not the key to success in life. They argue that thus born with positive attitude, but they start to change themselves later. The point has merit, because not all people has positive attitude success in life, some of them are struggle. However, positive attitude benefits people to receive a lot of knowledge, and become more successful. Therefore, positive attitude can give a person chances, to make connection with different people.

To conclude, positive attitude carry the mean of being a human. Because you can't say you're a good person with negative attitude. It's necessary to have a quality attitude, that may persuade other to change theirs. Lastly,

a guest person who have positive attitude can live anywhere he or she goes. The lesson, if you see your attitude people are not happy with try to modifying it.                                                   ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0
E6338A929654,"Having self reliance is a important key to success in life because self reliance is making your own efforts and decisions. I agree that people should make their own decisions because they should have freedom to make their own choices. They should think for them self.

Having the freedom to make their own choices is important because if they can have the freedom to choose what they want the experts are going to choose something that they dont like, or want. For example, the person wants to buy some fancy shoes but the authorities dont like those shoes they are going to say no and decide to buy other shoes. In my thinking I would not like to someone choose for me because they dont know what I like, or what I dont like. If they let other people make there choices they are not going to be happy because the expert or the authorities are going to choose what they like not what the people want. For example, they go to the lunch room and there is a lot of food there and they are trying to get something but they dont let them get what they want because they dont have the freedom to make there own choice, so the authorities are going to come and choose the food for them.

Another reason is that the person can think for them self. If the persons cant think for them self they are going to have a lot of problems in there life because if the expert, or the authorities comes and ask the persons something and they cant think, the experts are going to think for the persons and make choose something that the persons will not like.

In conclusion, having the right, or the freedom to make the decisions for them self is a good think because everyone wants to make their own decisions they dont want no one to be telling them what to do, or what to think. The persons are going to have the freedom to choose what they want to do with there life.         ",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5

To begin with my talent, my talent is roaring like a lion, is like a deep voice and just pushing air in my throat. My other talent is hoola-hooping with my arms, just making circles with my arms for the movement of the hoola-hoop. My final talent is drawing, i enjoy drawing because i can draw what i'm feeling but i need to be more detailed.

Next my skill, my skill is swimming fast, I only use my arms and legs for more movement and i would need a lot of energy for it. My other skill is running fast, I use my legs and ball up my fist for more movement. My final skill is holding my breathe long, it's risky but I would beat my friend's scores.

When i first came to USA all my family was tellimg to learn english. First when i was learning a little be of english, and my teacher told me to practice english in the class (talk to others students in class), but i was scare that the student make fun of me, so that day i did not spoke english in class i told my self ( i going to learn and make my self proud)

at the end of the school year my english was better i was always epeaking english with my sister and to my teachers too.

Others people think taht if you can""t do something you have to stop doing it or stop trying, others will told you that you can""t do it, but remember you can do everything you propouse .

E853D5DD528D,"People should be guidance by experts and authorities because in that way we can have less people killing each other; however, their are people that don't like to share their situation and there is where the suicide came from.

Although some say that people shouldn't to be guide by experts because they don't like to people tell them what to do, actually people should be guide by experts because they can show people to love each other and make a better world with no violence.

Their are people that don't like to be guide by others but they have a knowing in their life in what is good and bad by their experiences. For example my gram pa, he doesn't like to be guide by others but he said that he has an understanding in what is good and bad. He also told me that some people try to guide you for the bad way, by showing you how to drink beers or smoke cigarettes and you have to be ready to say not to those type of drugs but, I believe that we need to have experts and authorities to guide us about life's important.

Actually, people should seek guidance from experts and authorities because some experiences have better knowing then other ones and learn how to love each other. I would like to be guide by experts and learn about their experiences. That could be awesome.

Some times is better to make your own idea because that person that is by your side such as, your girlfriend or your mother could be wrong, and there is when you make a mistake and start to be disappointed with your self, In that time is when you are frustrated and you could kill your self or hurt someone else.

Violence can be make by a bad understanding. That's why people should seek guidance from experts and learn how to talk to each other. Usually if you are young , sometimes we don't know have to talk and their where problems came from. However

I encourage to al young people you seek guidance from experts until they have a better knowing in their decisions.

We need to stopped the violence and start to love each other, but we have to seek guidance from expert and authorities about life important matter.

E8795A1AA404,"When making life decisions it is good to ask someone for help then making the desicison yourself. Why is it better asking someone about the decision is because they could tell you either the desicison is good or they could tell you that don't do it and try to find a better idea. When making a life decision you have to think about the importance, how much it would cost me or whats the overall budget, and how its going to help me achieve in life.

When making life decisions it really matters on how its important to you or how its going to effect you in life. As life goes on do I think its going to help me improve what Im doing right now or is it going to drop me and destroy me for life. When making life decisions it also depends on how you're looking at that particular thing/object. Thats why you should ask someone else who is already doing that particular thing from before or ask someone who could give you an personal opinion/advice that would actually make you think if making this life decision is worth it or not.

When buying something big that will have a effect on my life i would have think about my budget and how am I going to afford this project without having any issues. So to do that I would ask someone for advice who is already doing that business or investment. When asking others for advice I would have to think about how they're going to respond and what they're going to say. This is why budget is also a very big thing when it comes to making life decisions is because I would have to pay that amount in order to have my business or investment stand out out the people around me.

Why would I have to ask someone to achieve my investment or business. To achieve my business i would have to ask someone for a advice who is already doing something similar to that. As Im asking for the opinion or the advice i would have to think how or what Im going to do to improve that decision. What hard work or thinking of mine or someone else's would have to go in that play to achieve the decision. As I would be achieving the decision I would have to see how Im being affected with it and how much pressure its putting on me. Why would I ask others for advice when I have brain and thats because they're going to have a different mind set from me. They probably think better than me or in some way where we both agree on the same fact to achieve the business or investment in a better way. This is why you should ask someone else for a advice or a opinion than going in alone in such a big decision that could impact your life in less than some days.

In conclusion to making life decisions it is a good idea to ask someone else for a advice than making the move alone. Its because someone else has a different mind set than you yourself. Thats why when making a life decision you should think about what things and what mind set you need to proceed with your investment or business. So the mains things you need is how important the investment or business is to me, How high or low my budget is, and what will I have to do to achieve this business/investment. For all these reasons you should always ask a person about their advice or opinion even though I might not listen to it but it doesn't hurt to ask. They'll give me the best advice or opinion even how big or little the investment/business is.",3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5

Then after all that he learned that he will never let the haters get into his head and take his life and use him like a toy, so he told me that is that if people try to do use you or say that can't be this in the future all you have to is do ignore everyone who tries to get in the way in the way of your life.

One reason the school board shouldnt add one and a half more hours is because there will be no time for after school activities. For example if Generic_Name has soccer practice anymore. Another example is if Generic_Name hosts computer club she cant host it because there is no time for hosting her club. Another example is if they and one hour and a half then there would be no time to have fun at school.

The second reason the school board should not add one hour and a half is because your going to have to give the teachers more money for the extra hours. An example is that if there child is sick and they need to pick them up but they cant because they are teaching. Another example is if Generic_Name is the boss of the school board and the extra one hour and a half she is going to have to do extra work so she make sure that everyone gets there pay check. Another example is teachers are going to have to make sure they have enough work for the extra time and plus they have to grade all of the work the students do. The last example is that the bell schedule will be different and the people who work are going to do a lot of work to schedule lunch and everything.

Another reason i disagree with my school adding one hour and a half more time is that the teachers are going to have to face a lot of tied and sleeping students. Another example is if half of the students are sleeping and tiered there is no point of teaching them because they are likely not going to do work or forget everything they learned that day. Another example is that the teachers will be angry from all the students with their heads down because they are tiered. Another example is that students and teachers have family and places to be.

If we have online class it can be hard to these people who got distracted for anything .Once I had a friend her name was Generic_Name, and she had a online math class that she needed to be able to graduated.

One night, i decide that it's not the time to just give up on yourself, after everything what i've had done. After that night, whenever i thought this to myself. I went every single day to my swimming practice, also thinking thoughts of head to never give up. All this sudden, i became more successful ! i was a leader to my swimming team.

Also, failure gives us more experience and mastery before we complete our goal.

Those who believe that we should lose the enthusiasm after fail many times in what we want, have their reasons. They think that being pushing your self getting stress by starting something that you couldn't have done before, is a way to waste time because, you're not going to complete it anyways. They also believe that it's really hard to start over again knowing that if you try it one more time you might fail it all the same even though you don't achieve success.

One reason why we should not lose the enthusiasm after failure is that people learn from their mistakes. A way to learn is being consistent and do not give up, even if there are many difficulties that make us think that we should leave our goals and dreams. As example of this is my friend, Generic_Name, who had to take his math test multiply times. First, he took it at the first time without even study, as result of that he didn't pass it as well. Second, the teacher gave him a second opportunity to take it. This time he studied much better than the first time but he didn't pass it again, he felt stressful ""what's going on to me"" he said because, he knew that he needed to pass that test. Then, he asked to the teacher for a third chance to take it. But this time he studied really hard for many hours, he also knew what the test was going to be like because he had taken it before. As result he passed the test with a good score. What happened to Generic_Name is a perfect example why should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed something couple times. If Generic_Name hadn't been consistent by studying and taking it more than one time, he wouldn't have passed the text. Therefore we should never lose the enthusiasm after fail many times.

Other reason why we should keep the enthusiasm even if we have failed something is that, failure gives us more experience and confidence before we complete or reach our goals. As example of this is my self. The last year I had lost to do, such as school, work and other responsibilities that required me to drive. Then, my parents decided that it was time to let me drive. I was really excited thinking in the way that my daily was going to change. But it wasn't that easy because, firstly, I had to pass the driver test, next learn how drive and finally get a car. In that point I wasn's really sure if I wanted to continue with that. Then I decided con continue it and I went to take the test, I couldn't pass it at the first time. I felt sad about it, but after studying all the rules again I came back to take on this time I was able to pass it as well. But, I still needed to get a car, fortunately my parents brought me one. Now I have a car and my driver's license even though I was hard to make it. What happened to me is a perfect example of being consistent and don't give to get success. If I hadn't been consistent even that I had failed it, I wouldn't have gotten my driver license. Therefore we should never lose the enthusiasm after fail sometimes.

In conclusion, based in those reasons I support Churchill's statement, and I'm agree with the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. Although some say that we should give up after fail multiply times. Actually we should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed something that we want because, it's a way to learn more and a way to build our confidence, and we also become successful by being consistent.

EBF9131A638F,"Distance learning is a new learning method for students to attend classes from home by online or you can video conference. Schools have brought distance learning in their system for students can do their assignments from home. Many people think this is a great idea and some oppose to this learning method. The schools can see if they are on track or online to their classes but if they arn't in the online class they will be behind in their assignments. Is this new learning method a great way to learn? or does being in a class with a teacher more beneficial for the student?

The main problem in distance learning is if students are really getting on the online class. Students who do get on are on task and on point. The students who get on the computer and get on the online class for a short period of time at home might be playing, or might not be concentrated, because he is at home and dosen't feel like doing it. Students who don't do their assignments they wait until they are at school because in school you arn't distracted like at home you are concentrated and ready to work. Is distance learning beneficial for students at home? for some students it might be but for many it isn't.

Is online learning at home beneficial for students? some students do think its beneficial and a really great idea. Many people prefer learning in class with a teacher because they can ask questions if they don't get the question that is being asked. Students do some of their work but get off in a short period of time if they are at home, if they were at school the students would be on task and doing their assignments, unlike at home they would be off task. Many students prefer teachers teaching them so they can get more information of what they are being taught. Distance learning isn't capable of doing what you do in a classroom. Is distance learning really beneficial?

Is being taught in a classroom more beneficial for students? many students prefer being taught by a teacher than online. Students are more productive and they share their thoughts and explanations in that specific assignment than online classroom. All the students are in the same page and all gathering more information by writing notes and being concentrated in their tasks. Students are more interactive with each other and sharing thoughts and many techniques to get the answers by fellow classmates, also getting good grades. Classroom learning is beneficial for many students and teachers.

Students have their own way of learning, it doesn't matter if its distance learning nor in a classroom. It is how they feel how they enjoy learning. Students will say this is the best way for learning other no this is, it doesn't matter what you think is the best way to learn its how you enjoy learning something it is the best way for you. The students who prefer distance learning really do it at home and feel like they are learning mush more at than in a classroom. Students who enjoy learning in a classroom like being around peers and want knowledge from everyone around them. They are both beneficial for that specific student.     ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5

Why the most students like working in group and not alone? the most students prefer working with friends, because in schools the works or homework require more the one students ,but .Some people said of working alone is more benefits for the students. I believe of working in group you can make friends, helping together, and have more time for you work.

The first reason,

if working in group you can make friends because you need talk about the work,

sometime the students speak their experience or opinions about the work,but when the students is not the same country, and the works talk about the country or religious is good because. The students have different opinion and sometime you make friends when you with other students have the same opinion, and when working in group you and your friends have time for talk.

In second reason helping together, because you can ask if you work is good or opinions about the work and look of more information. You can help for materials if you friend not have, and helping together if you consider the work is good or not or change sometime or have or ideas you can tell.

The third reason you have more time for you work if you working in group. Because sometime the teachers not give much day for you work ,and the work is hard, and require much information you can divide the work with you friend . The finally check the information, and put together or you can decide what part you wants working or what parts you can create.

Students might change their minds of playing around in school from visiting this type of job students will see people working hard and fast every single day and getting paid a small amount so students would not want to be working at a place like that in there future so it could pursue them to start putting more effort in school and not to play around in class, and have a successful job.

Some parents don't have money to put their child in school Furthermore there are going to have to work at a hard working job but students don't have to because you have a chance and you got your education so it might teach students to take this advantage to have a success job and not to play around on the other hand teens that don't get their education will work at a place that pay a small amount.

If students don't take their education serious your parents paid the money for your education and if you just don't pay attention and not try the money your parents paid will be a waste because you didn't learn anything cause you goof of and you won't be able to have a successful job so visiting this job will change students thought pf whether they should play around or not so if you take your education serious you can have a job that pays you a lot of money and be successful in life but not doing anything in school won't get you anywhere.

Girls,if you reading this please don't make the same mistakes that i did in my past be always honest with your partnership or whoever, because the consequences are not how you might think. When i was in 8th grade i met this person i was so in love with him,he add me on snapchat so that same day that he add me i post a pictures that i was in the field,35 minutes after he text me i was so happy,and nervous because i liked him so we start texting but we never talked in person,a week pass by and he start to being disrespectful with me,playing with my feelings i knew that we were just friends in those time. One day i told him that i want him to be honest with me,he always said that he was honest with me,2 week pass by he were keeping playing his little games and i did not say anything i just leave his message in delivered,1 years pass by he texted me saying that he felt so bad for everything he did to me in the past,i just told him everything that i felt for him in the past but he was not honest with me. Girls,let me tell you my big mistake that i did,we talk about 5 months as a friend after we talk for 5 months he make me his girlfriend,at the time i was still feeling butterfly for him that first years is was perfect like any relationship,those 12 months i was so happy,i always told him that he was ''the love of my life'' and i just say it for everything we went trough since middle school also,because he was my first boyfriend and my parents were fine that i was dating him because they though he was a good person.

Yes, they might be real and make you feel butterfly 5 months or 6,but things changes in this life person change not everything is always the same,anyways he started to lie to me when i knew that truth of that problems is when he start to hurt me all the time but when you love someone you let them hurt you,so i keep letting him hurt me,i started crying and to supplicated to stop hurting me he stop like any relationship we were okay for a week and then he started doing things that hurt,he started talking to girls,and cheated on me but us girls we so dumb that we keep them.2 Years after i was in depression i did not tell my parents they found out when they take me to the hospital because i passed out in my room crying, without eating for days i was in the hospital for a week after that i was able to go they take me to therapy. after 5 months of going to therapy,i was able to talk him to close a chapter because i learn to forgive but in my heart i felt hate for him what i told him was ""i love you but i love other person more than you and that person i'ts me"" yes, he cried but he did not deserved me .Finally i let toxic people leave my life,i'm not going to lie like i'm afraid to talk a guy again because i feel they will hurt me. i'm not thinking to go out with a guy because girls you have to love yourself to be able to love other person.

A test can be enjoyable because you can proof that you smarter than other people by getting a high score and thats fun and proof the people that they were wrong about you. Life is enjoyable because you have a lot of memories that happen since you were born until whatever age you are now but time is relative so don't stop having fun in life. Enjoyment can come from many things like getting a goal in a game, a hundred in a test, accomplishing something for the first time but there are many things that can bring joy in life. As you get older you learn new things, you get wiser but also you have more befits and disadvantages. For example, adults and older people have money and with money you can get things and spent it in anything you want and plus y'all can drive and go places and thats what people enjoy too. A huge disadvantage for adults is that they have to work for 8 or more hours but either way imagination never gets old but instead it gets newer.

EDA0DCA3FC41,"I don't think that school districts should allow students to graduate early. I believe that this is a bad idea because students have to take more classes than what you usually take, students would have to stay after school or maybe even take summer school, so they can get enough credits to graduate early, and students would be very stressed having to learn all this material for each of their classes, since they won't be taking any electives. For these reasons, I don't think school districts should allow students to graduate early.

Students who are graduating early, will have to take extra classes during the school year, so that they can earn the credits for their classes. In many schools, you have to have at least four credits in one subject, so that means the student will most likely have to take two classes of one subject to earn the credits for that one specific subject. Some students graduating early, might have a difficult time being all caught up in each of their classes, which can lead to them having to stay after school to take tutoring classes in case they don't understand the material being taught.

Most students, will either have to take school during the summer or they stay after school to take extra classes. Students who stay after or do summer school do this, so that they can earn all the credits they need to graduate early. Students who choose to do summer school don't have to take that many classes when they go back to school, since they already took some classes during the summer. Students who choose to stay after school to take extra classes, will have to stay in school longer, so they can learn all the material for the subjects that they are taking after school.

Students will be stressed and under pressure when it comes to learning and studying for each of their classes. They will be stressed because they're going to have to study for a lot of their classes, when they take tests and sometimes they can have tests in multiple classes on the same day, which means they are going to have to study for multiple classes. Same thing applies with homework, they will feel under pressure to get all their work done. They wouldn't be taking any electives, so that means all their classes will be hard, since elective classes are usually easy.

This is why I think that graduating early is a bad idea, because students will be very tired and stressed trying to catch up on school work. If you do four years of High School instead of three years, everything will go a lot slower than three years and also you will be less stressed, when it comes to catching up on school because you will have less classes to worry about. This is why it's better to do four years of High School.        ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0
EDFFA0E4D88C,"Should school weeks consist on four days with days of 10 hours of school ? on my opinion there is no point on doing that, people that work is going to miss hours at work because of this, students are going to use that extra day to not study and be home doing nothing, and people instead of using electronics at school are going to use them more at home.

Some students work after school, they need time to go home and get ready for work and with school days being longer it would be pointless to work, you will be making 3 or 4 hours a day, some students,specially on senior year, need to pay bills or make money for the future to pay college. on my opinion the best thing to do is to keep the regular five days at school, and to keep working at least six hours a day.

Teachers and staff members are thinking that students are going home and they will do their homework or study, but what they dont think is that some people need help with school work, or they feel more comfortable studying at school, now with that less day they will be more students failing projects and exams, for example if a students used to study at the library after school he is not going to be able because it is going to be late by the time he gets out of school, they should keep the normal schedule for all the students that are getting benefits from it

People wants to save energy and money by taking away a day of school, but they dont think that students will be going home to use their cellphones, watch TV, play video games, and a lot of more things that consume energy, if they stay at school they are not going to be able to use their cellphones or any other electronic device, they will just use it during breaks and lunch, so that is less time than being home a whole extra day.

For all this reasons a think that it would be better for students to keep with the regular schedule and keep coming to school everyday, for the regular hours, in that case they will not miss any hours at work, they will have more time to study and to do homework at school, and they will not use their electronic devices as much as they would at home, even though the idea of saving money and electricity its such a good idea some students dont understand that and they will not do it at home.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

The students who have a job can have problems with their bosses and it can make a more hard schedule for the student because they don't gonna have any time to rest and they can have troubles at school if they don't rest the necesari for their health and their consentration at school; other negative thing is because it's unnecessary because it's not a big chage, if the school want to save energy one day don't gonna make a big change and also, maybe it's okay as it's and I think the original schedule with five days of school is good for all and it don't make any problem, and the last negative thing I see is the hours of work of the teachers, the teachers maybe don't do enough hours of work and don't get the same payment and maybe can affect them in that way.

These idea also have positive things like the chance for students and teachers to rest more or just for students, they have more time to do homework or work, other positive thing is to save a bit of energy and some resources, in some way the school can get benefit of these.

First reason, that Community service is important because the mayor of the city will be proud. Some people say ''What a mess is here!''. The community service is come for help.

I would like to do is to stay on top of all my classes for school to be succesful in life. People say its a challenge to stay on top. When I look at it, I say every challenge always has a way to get through it.

The reason why I would like to pass all my classes is because I want to use that as a skill in my life. At the end of college, people always wanted to be big things like presidents, surgeons and other important jobs. In real life people who cared less about that, are just sitting in a cubicle just to answer calls for a living, which is not a bad thing. I dont want my life to end up as those people, I want to make a big impact in our everyday society, like Steve Jobs. He made a big impact in peoples lives by releasing a new iPhone model every year, but he didnt just start a company that fast. He needed to be educated and was the smartest kid in his school, all the way to college, he was a smart and cooperative guy until his passing. Thats why I am planning ahead to stay on top of school and college so I can try to make a great impact for people. Instead of trying to stay awake in a boring office with the meanest boss in the world and with a low salary to one meal per week.

Another reason why I would like to be successful in my classes is because It made a huge impact on my uncle, Generic_Name. Back in my uncles time, my parents and my uncle lived together in a small town house in Generic_City, he was uneducated. My uncle was an outgoing guy but didnt care about his education back in college, he was always on the couch eating Cheerios and watch Tom and Jerry on the T.V. My parents and I started to convince my uncle to start repeating college, but he didnt care, he just wanted fun in his life and not care about anything education related. That all changed when he realized that he had pay rent and that he wasnt educated, so he finally took the opportunity to repeat college, we were happy for him to do it. He scored high scores in all his tests and was awarded a scholarship for Generic_School and graduated with a high masters degree for law and got a job for jr lawyer. Now, he rose up to make the best lawyer in Generic_City and makes 500,000 thousand dollars a year and lives in a mansion with nice cars and to share all his fortune with his family. This story has inspired me that I should stay on task with all my classes and to plan my future career ahead in time.

The final reason why I want be a successful kid in all my academics is because of opportunities, just like my uncle, Generic_Name, He came to the top because of smart he really was in college. Just like my uncle, I want to be like him and to open the door to so many career opportunities in which society has to offer, like Will Smith's movie, The Pursuit Of Happiness which was based on a real story . This talks about some emotional topics about a man named Chris Gardner was not making money and has his son with him to look after. He wasnt able to do his job right by selling bone density scanners and barely enough to pay rent or daycare after his wife left him. He got his life back together by repeating college and moving, but soon he opened the door to so many job opportunities and later in his life became a multi-millionare in 5 weeks. Based of this act, I started to think that anything can be possible as long as you put your mind to it. That way I can open many opportunities in my life.

These are the reasons why I want stay on top in all my academics is because I want to change the world the way people see it. I want people to know my name for all the hard work and impact I did, staying on top of classes accomplishes anything, it can make me into a very important person who makes a lot of money, but in order to complete that task.

According to Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""determine never to be idle. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, because we have more activities, get more possibilities to be someone in the life, and develop our mind.

My first reason is we have more activities help our body to be active ,and health for example when we play some games like, soccer, baseball, track, our body imediatilly is activated, because we need to be active and that helps that our body can be healthy, and that prevent some diseases because if our body is inactive we can feeling,sad and stress. My second example is, when I went to field trip, I was happy ,because I went to some place where I can distracted and relax with the nature, and that help me because doing activities that maintain the body active and it is more helpful for our mind.

My second reason is get more possibilities to be someone in the life,for example, we can always pay attention in the classes,and concentrate, we need to be more active the mind because that help learn more and that too help in the future. My second example is, last year wanted to pass my grade, I needed to be active in my classes and had better scores in all my classes and do my homework, so I can pass my classes because I was active and all my classes and homework, and I put attention all that the teacher said me during the class.

Some people think to be active is not help in the life, and idles is more better than active because, people said to be active people can get transtorn in the mind. But they are incorrect because, development our mind for example, sometimes we can feel depress we don't want to do nothing, our mind is develop each day about the activities, works, and other things what do each day, and that help to our mind be more active.

In some cause on school, teachers sometimes don't like or don't prefer students working in groups because they want to see if they know how to do the work and if they can actually do it by themselves, or sometimes they worry that one person won't do the work and just let the rest of the people in the group do the work,or just do wherever the other guys are doing, or copy work from them, is true that it could happen in some occasions, but is not always like that,and the reasons why it would be good to allow students to work in group would be that, if every student knows how to the work,then every student can participate doing a different activity on the group and cooperate with anyone, or if the student doesn't know how to do the work, then he\she can get help from his/her partners to explain the him/her how to do the work ,and them she/he can be able to do the work,and they all can be able to participate in the activities.

Has a conclusion, it would be better do work in groups, because in that way it could be easier to get the work done, because you can get help from others in the work,and it would be more fun because you can work with your friends at the same time that they do the work, and it could also be another way of how to met people and make new friends when sometimes you have to work with people that you don't know, and for the people that like to work by themselves, maybe they should know all those benefits of working with people, but is they think that they have no problem working by themselves or that they can get the work done by themselves, then that should be okay to.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0
EFACA593A52B,"Can you imagine a world where every person is optimistic and responsible in their job. According to ""

The Washington Post,

"" 65% of the workers are hard-working and loves their job. ""Most employers are looking for specific characteristics in a potential employee. For example, they look for someone who is responsible and hard-working, and often they look for a person who has experience."" In some countries, start working at age of 15 years old is mandatory, because it helps to young people to obtain new views about different kind of jobs. Everyone has the capacity to be a responsible in their labor, but some people are hard-working because they want to accomplish their goals, and have an excellent record and experience from the last job is so important.

The first reason why is so important to be a hard-working is because you can accomplish your goals. For example, my friend Generic_Name, she started worked when she was 16 years old, she studied and worked at the same time. Generic_Name worked very hard to accomplished her goals. Generic_Name's goals was: be a teacher, buy a house, a car and save money for the College. It was not easy for her, but she was optimistic. She wake up every morning at 6:00 o'clock to go school, and she always fought for have a better future and accomplished her goals. Generic_Name over time get a lot of experience and she inspired others people to do better their jobs. She won a prize for been doing well her job and supported others to inspire to do an extraordinary job. Working hard is the best way to demonstrate you can work in any place and loves your job.

The second reason is when you are working is important to leave an excellent record, because it help to develop a good characteristics and experience. In some jobs, they call to ask for details about if the person have an excellent record and experience. Furthermore, my uncle Generic_Name, he just moved from New York to California, and he was looking for a new job. Generic_Name worked as an engineer in

Village's Company

. He was doing well his job in New York, but he needed moved. He went to apply in this new place, and the employers called to Village's Company asking for details about how he was doing his job when he was working for them, and then Village's Company says ""Generic_Name was one our best worker we had, he was responsible and he have the knowledge about his job."" The new company hired my uncle because he leave an excellent record. Hiring a person who has experience is important, because it help to develop better a job. Some people may argue that be a responsible and hard-working is not necessary in a job. However, be responsible is so important, because people are getting more experience and more capacity to do their labor. Some people do not like to follow the rules when they are in their jobs.

In conclusion, we can not change the entire world, but start been responsible and working hard in our jobs is beneficial, because it is the place where we can inspire others to do their jobs well and any company will hire us for been excellent workers. Every labor is admirable, and we can care our jobs because it depends we can accomplish any goal we has in our life. We can show a lot characters in our work such as: be respecfull, be on time, and the most important things is love our jobs.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,2.5,3.5
EFD563DFAC60,"Although some people might say that students should use cell phones in the classroom for education purpose. Also some people might says that cell phones can effect students study and their grades in school, and it is not a good thing for students to having their cell phones in classroom.

However, not everyone agrees with this position,because cell phones can effect students health such as eyes problems if students look at it for a long time. And it can get students interest about games or social media or app for chatting. Additionally, there might be support for this idea that cell phones can help students to search on things or information that they are looking for in class. Also cell phones can help students easily to contact with their friends at school or to call their parents in an emergency situations.

Ultimately, this argument cannot stand because cell phones can effect students scores, students might be missing something important in the class while playing with cellphones. It seems like nothing but cellphones can destroy students future. The reason this idea is fallible that students cannot focus on class if they are using cell phones in the classroom.

Given these points, students might be get addicted to cell phones and cell phones will became a bad habit for students. One possible solution to this issue might be using cell phones only for an emergency problems or education problems. some students that can control the limit of using cell phones. Students better to use cell phone in the classroom when it is necessary, but not for the game or chatting with someone else.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5
F05D3802BC94,"Last year, a student in my classroom was caught using his cellphone during class. He pointed out that the reasoning behind it was that he was searching something that involved the class, but the teacher still took up his phone. By allowing the use of cellphones in class many students would get even more distracted than they already are. It would also be easier to cheat and get good grades, since all the information would be of easy access. On the other hand, this would make the technological integration in school even better and easier, something that many dream and believe will happen in the close future. I believe cellular devices should not be allowed during educational time.

Initially, cellphones would draw too much of student's attention. Teenagers spend enough time of their day staring at screens, and school should be a place where that doesn't happen. Many are addicted to social media, and have the ""need"" to check it every 10 minutes. Sometimes when I am in class and decide to take out my phone, not looking and paying to the teacher for more than a minute makes me loose focus of class and need to ask the ones around me for help. Class is a place where students should focus and pay attention, by allowing the use of phones many would get distracted and use it for non-educational purposes which would make learning harder, since this focus should be used on what the teacher is saying instead of what their friends are posting online.

Secondly, it would be an encouragement to cheating. With the integration of cellphones in class students would start getting better grades, since many of them would simply Google all of the answers for a worksheet instead of paying attention to the class and answering it based on what they've learned. This would make so that daily grades get better, but when test day arrives, the student who Googled every answer in the past week would get a bad grade because he didn't really learn anything, all his answers were based on someone or something helping him. This would then encourage cheating, because that student would most likely realize that with the use of his cellphone daily grades were getting better, but when it came down to not using the device his grades would drop.

However, it could be helpful and very easy to set up. With limitations in place, like blocking certain apps and websites that have nothing to do with school, cellphones could be useful during educational time. Technology integration in schools is already happening, many give chrome books to students so they can use it during class, but these are expensive and getting one for every student is not always viable. Everyone has a cellphone so there would be no need for extra devices ,since phones have 1000 different uses, including many that could be of help during educational time.

The student from my classroom which was caught using his cellphone still uses it during class, he is barely passing that class and complains that the teacher is not explaining something correctly and that is why he has such low grades. But everyone knows the reason he is almost failing is because he'd rather stare at his cellphone screen instead of paying attention to the teacher. Cellular devices draw too much of teenager's attention and can also encourage cheating. On the other hand they can be helpful in the right occasion. I strongly disagree with the use of cellphones during educational time and believe they would cause more harm than they would help.",4.0,4.0,5.0,4.5,5.0,5.0
F06D9612B900,"One activity i consider really enjoyable are science experiments . One of the reasons i consider these activities fun is because they are different from other types of projects . And what i mean by this is that for example when one does a math project or a language arts project is nothing more then doing many math exercises or writing an essay . Unlike the science projects for example one time i got to see a frog's interior . And it might sound desgusting to many of the people reading this and to be honest it did'nt smell good either . But one of the things that facinated me from the project it was that frogs dont have as many organs as we human's do . Or maybe they removed some of them but there wasn't a lot of organs in there

And another thing i was curious about was that they were different colors . i remember seeing blue and pink unlike us humans almost all of our insides are red . Frogs actually got different colors in their interior but they looked a little dry because my teacher told me that they have been frozen for some time . But it defenently made it easier to cut parts in the interior of the frog . And also sense my teacher told me that we were able to cut whatever we wanted me and my group tried to explore as much as possible . But there was a part that was really desgusting which was that there was some flies in the frog's stomach . And that part definently disgusted me but it didn't made me want to stop either.

After we finished trying to see everything inside the frog the teacher told us the name and function of each of the parts of the frog . But one of my friend decided it was silly to poke the frog's eye . And until this point i still dont know what went trough his mind in that exact moment . But wen he poke it , it resulted that the frog's eye was'nt completly frozen so liquid from the eye just came rushing out and he got wet because he decided to do that . Fortunently it did'nt reach me but it defenently reach my mate . After that the teacher send him to the bathroom to wash himself .

After that happened my teacher decided that it was best to just stop the project after that . But it was defenently a lot of fun .

Another example of a project was recently when my tacher decided to have us do a project in the dark because is themed to what we are learning about right now . Which is the unit of light and the project was really simple and to be honest it wasn't as amazing and funny as the other project . But it was to spray a liquid in front a flashlight . And what was supposed to happen was that i would be able to see the waves which light travels on . And after the teacher explained the process of how this happens she told us to spray the liquid in front of the flashlight and being honest i didn't see anything i was kind of dissapointed . But after four seconds i could see them and they were kind off hard to see and it was for some few seconds but i actually enjoyed the project . But it had some downs like it was really short and the teacher took forever to explain the process . But i still think it was a really interesting project .

And what i tried to show by showing you this examples from my own personal experiences is that . Science experiments are not always boring and you may not like them but you should give them a chance . And i promise you that you are going to like them or at least one of the many projects there is . Because they make class a little more interesting . And in my opinion projects or experiments are the best activities there is in the school . Beacause they teach you in a more directs type of learning . And that's why i think they are the best .

F07EB7B6F40E,"I have been through so many things in my life and imagination has help go through the crazy thing in life. I would want to leave everything and everyone . Imagination has helped me realize that i could become who ever I wanted to be. It even helps me through any problem. It help me realize that can prove people wrong by just imagining the best things in life are coming my way. No matter how much i'm going through, i'm always going to be happy and grateful for what I have and gone through. Without the bad days you will never know how to enjoy the good ones.

Remember everything happens for a reason!

Imagination helps me have hope no matter what I have gone through . I had to imagine a lot when my brother went to jail. I would always have to believe thats it going to be fine. I would always imagine that my brother was home and that I could see him again. No matter how hard it was for me. Every time we would go visit him and it was time to leave I had to imagine that he was coming home with me. Even every time we would go to court I would have to imagine that they would let him leave. Sometime knowing thats their two much on my head, imagining help me feel free and peaceful with no problem.

It was hard dealing with my brother and school on top of that. Imagination really change how I look at life. It makes me bring out my creativeness out. It made me realize what I have been missing out on. Imagination help me forget everything thats going on in life no matter how big or small the problem is. Also it help me feel myself and not pretending to be someone that i'm not. Sometimes going through things help you understand why it happened to you. But at the movement it might seem horrible. I just know that there is a purpose for me and that end!

Knowledge might be a great thing but imagination helped me achieve things that I never thought before. Imagination help me feel good about my self. It help block all the negative things. Imagining helps me know that I can do what ever I want , I just have to put my mind and heart to it. Also it helps me feel unique from everyone else. It helped me gain self respect and convinces. Imagination is a great thing for every thing. It might seem weird but it helps in many different ways. Thinking out side the box is not always a bad thing it help me bring out my smartness and strongest things through everything in life. I do think imagination is really important in life.

F100483B6259,"Can you imagine someone that want to study more and to get more knowledge? Well, many people do want to continue studying because the more knowledgeyou know, you will have a more benefits in your life. Furthermore, like the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" He's because we never stop learning the little things in life such as: explore the world and to never stop your dream of continue your study. I agree with Emerson's statement because we want to get in our goal in the survey and to never stop growing with mentality.

First reason is that we have to explore the world. For example, by exploring the world we will know like the different cultures of each country or by having friends that are different country. Like my mom always said ""You have to get out of the box to learn more, to see and explore what you have at your surroundings"".

Second, to never stop your dream of continue your study. For instance, if you want to grow mentally you have to study more to get the knowledge you want. The more knowledge you have, then the more great will be your job or even more better you can be your own boss. However, people will never grow if they don't continue their survey.

Finally as you can see, Emerson's statement ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" is true because we will never stop learning, and the more you study the more knowledge you will know.      ",4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5
F11E6745A8DA,"I think this is benefiting being able to stay at home and do online classes sounds good. I agree because doing online class it goes on your own paste and you wont feel to rushed to finish, another good reason would be doing online is that you dont have to show up to school anymore so youll get to sleep in and wake up whenever. My final reason is if someone if decides to go to college they'll be ready because thats how college is online.

Think about not being able to have time to finish your work and your teacher saying you only have 25mins or by the end of class everything needs to be finished? well that wont have to be the case anymore because doing online means youll be going at your paste and you wont have to rush to turn things in. For example, I take an online class, so for me I already know how it works and honestly I think its way easier because no teacher is yelling at me to hurry about or I dont have to turn in incomplete work. so I like doing the online class is also fun because I be at home while doing my work in my bed.

Rough day at work, and you know you have school the next morning? Well no worries because you get to sleep in and do you school work from your bed. Thats right, dont have to wake up early and go to school. Just chill at home in your bed and do your work. Thats why i agree that we should have online classes because Ill enjoy my bed and do my work from home.

finally, last but not least college. if you ever plan to go to college then best believe that college is online class and video conferencing. Nothing new go to the library and study from there who wouldnt like that.?

F123CF0BF9DB,"Should people make their own decitions, or should they follow, others experts and authorities about life's experience. However from what think if you are alone out of no where and you don't have any exprerience is much better because you get to have your experiences and no one bothers yours plans. You make your own decitions and follow your own rules. On the other hand if you have some one on your back that do have more experiences them you they will be correcting you and bodering bothering you. Some people think that is better to follow some one decitions, but others think that is better to be alone because you must create your own decitions and follow yours rules is like you have a family no one is going to correct what are going to do with your family you don't follow others people they may be incorrect and you are correct and is better to be alone becuse you make your onw family whit your decitions and your rules.

To begin alone is better because you make your experiences from the mistakes.

you make your own decitions, but went you make a decition that coust you a mistake you get to have more experiences from the mistake that you did and went you have experiences from the mistake you learnd from the mistake that you need to be more responsible went you have a mistake you get to have a big experiences and that make you more strong and what you do and that makes you feel good and you become more responsible from the things that you do form the experiences that you have some people see that and they will have a hope on you and that you are going to be some one in the future and they will know you better because you are alone and not with some one that has more experiences you will raise you and your decitions.

Another think is that you must follow your own rules that you make. When you make your own rules no one is going to say some think to you they will follow your rules if they want to be with you however if you are with some one that has more experiences you must follow their rules and you dont want that to happent went you make your own rules and follow your rules you will know what is goint to happen but if you follow some one else rules you must be awear because you dont know what is going to happen, so is better to make your decitions your rules because you know that is good from what are you going to do so make your own rules and follow your own rules dont follow some one else rules you become more strong and more smart person.

Fanally the last reason why you should be aonle is that no one is going to bother you you will make every thing in your hands and no some one else hand they will not be on your back bothering you you will make every thing posible on your hand and if you are alone you will become and expert on the jod,company,schools the things that you do you will be the head on your decitions and you are no going to use some one else head and if you use their head they will correct you in what you do and if you do is like from what they thing is better ithey will be bodering you and that is not to good because it will be bad why it will be bad? Because they will make where do you walk in a way that you must don't want to walk they will make every thing possible to walk in their way and you want to walk in your way thier will make every thing possible they will bother you and no yuo must follow your way and your road to make every thing possible to have your own experiences and your own rules.

To conclude people must make their own decition, they should not be with some one else that has experiences or some tipe of company you must star from zero and trow the procces you will get to have some experiences from the mistakes that you did while you where working and wnet you have more experiences you will get to be more storng and you will grow in the things that you know and some people look at you and they will have a hope on you that you will make it to the end. On the other hand you must create your own rules you must be very organice on the rules that you make dont follow others person rules make your own rules and went yuo make your own rules you must know what is going to happen if every thing is going to be okay or bad, but if you follow some one else rules you will not know what is going to happen do must make your own rules so you can be unique and a expert. In adition, if you are alone no one is going to bother you in the things that you make becuase you are alone you are the boss no one is going to some some thing to you and you will guide others people went they see that you are alone and no with some one else you will grow alot in the thisngs that you do. Fanally you know now that the best thing is that you should be alone and no with some one else that they will make your own rules and you will learn from their experiences and you will not get to have your own experiences and no one is going to bother you is you are alone because of hall of that you must be alone and star from zere Thanks.",2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0

As i know some students really need to graduated early some of them need, to help their parents with some money. It's a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college early.

Some districts are offering programs for students ; for example they are allowing them to graduated in three years some students need to help their parents with some money. Also they want to graduate early because of college this programs really help students and high school.

Students who follow all this plans they have to be persistent to graduate in three years. To illustrated students wants this programs to be able to have the things that they want ; for example buy a car buy some clothes. Also students enjoy to hang out with friends so if they graduated early, they will work and have some money to buy what do they want. Students must follow all this plans to see the results.

While some people think that it's a good idea for students to finish high school and three years to enter college early, others argue that students don't learn enough in three years. There are several's ideas that improve this such as they didn't focus in learn more about assessments. people think that they don't learn enough in three years, they missed classes that they might need in the future; for example construction class we don't know if one day we are going to work in construction then we will need some skills in that job . Also advanced PE we are going to needed it for our healthy students need to know more about other classes that they might need it in the future.

I think it's a perfect idea for the students who wants to get a diploma in three years. Students need to work to help their parents for example pay the bills and all that.

Maybe that person has already tried the thing you wanna try he can give you his opinion on the item.

Maybe you wanna buy a car and some how the car doesn't work you gotta talk to the dealer ship about the car. Or if you wanna buy some medicen you have to ask first before you drink the medicen or else you can even die from it if it's bad for you.

F17F4DF6095D,"In my opinion i agree honesty is the best policy sometimes, however, honesty might hurt a person's feelings because the quality of being truthfulness is the key through out life. For that reason to support my answer your being trustworthy is better than done or obtained without lying to that person. hurting them more when you lie to them then be hundred percent honest with that person. so that why i believe honesty is the best policy sometimes even if u might hurt a person feelings.

First, not stealing, cheating because people will not have respect and lose trust for you. sometimes you could end up in bad situations and problems. so i feel like if you do these things i least own up to your problems by being honest by saying you did this or this happened. Also, people will say bad names to you like your all lies, your not trustworthy, and your dishonest so if you don't want anyone in this world to call you these names be honest at all times.

Then, being careful and saying sorry to the things u told people that was a lie instead of being dishonest changing that honesty i say that people start thinking your real and wanna be friends with you. instead those people out there hating you and talking behind your back almost everyday. so if u do these things it could change you as what type person your now then back then and it will change how people act towards you or behind your back most of the times.

Next, not hiding anything frank from people. For example, Generic_Name dating her best friend boyfriend secretly. like you don't wanna hide anything from the people you love or care for you always wanna be honest with them no matter what. you could break there hearts by not telling them somethings if the situations important that they most know. if you don't be honest life will make you feel stressful by hiding all these things your hiding from people so you do not wanna hide anything from the people u love or care for.

In conclusion, no one questioned the honesty of the judge's statement. so these are my main reasons to support why i agree with this old proverb says honesty is the best policy. ",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5
F1B4090C8B06,"If you challenge yourself, you will never become good at something you want to do or achieve it. Others believe that challenging yourself won't improve your growth. It's only going to make people struggle. Myself, however, agrees because putting yourself to a challenge can make people explore or learn many things. That is how many people become so talented at things they do now.

Going beyond can raise your confidence higher. My first time experiencing playing the flute was very difficult. The more time I practiced the notes and songs, the easier it got for me. After awhile, I wanted to to play a different instrument. The second instrument option for me when I began playing the flute was a violin. It was more difficult than playing the flute but eventually I got used to it. The more things anyone can accomplish, the more challenges there will be to be completed to improve growth.

School is a good example of improving yourself. There are specific kids who has disability in learning called Special Ed. The experience of being in self-contained classes were easy. For the kids who are capable of being in a larger group class have to make growth in order for them to be in a co-taught class or regular classes. I've got out of self-contained classes by making so many improvements to show that I don't need to be in self-contained.

Going beyond can make a big difference. Going beyond the goal is a great feeling because the goal is achieved and then the on to the next level.                    ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5
F1BB39C5E549,"In a centair time, many of us think about the benefits of working with a group or working alone. We the students treat the must that we can do to us califications. Exist a controversy,

that is how more we ca have concentration during the assigments in class.

I think these thow ways of work , can get a good results. Because working with a group or with ourselves , oneself have the responsability to concentrain and do our work. It is only put us effort to aprove classe.

When we working with a group during in class, this are help for us in class to convert more fun. We can share our ideas to do more faster the assignments. Also help to ourselves when one of the group don't usterstand about the topic. Even if the assignment are complete ,

the rest of the time the members maybe can talk to each other.

But this happen also when the students have a good communication and they are friendly. However sometimes can be difficult even the sudents don't try to study with the group or only due the part of oneself.

Sometimes is better working with agroup , because when working by oneself taht can be a little frustrate.

Students can have support with a group , but when a student working alone is difficult research information without a opion of another person. Working with a group students can be more fiendly with anothers students of differents countries and they can be more caring.

Students can show their abilities and be more prepare when they get a job. Also students learn more of the members . In totality this is a argument to the students that they can't work alone , but they have the opcion to work with a group to prepare.

In conclusion , I agree that is more better to work with a group in class than alone . It is a benefits to discover new people, hear more ideas,

and be fliendly. I think is more helpful to students do the assigments in class. Work alone can be difficult , but sometimes these help oneself to be indepent . It is more great have a goup with members that gonna help. It is only concentration in a group or not , beacsuse oneself need to be more improve everyday and pass classes. Work with effort , the students always need help in study in class is a benefit when students see all persons equal to working.     ",2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.5
F1DF4F89F70D,"Do you think that too much oil in your food affect your health, or it improve the ability of how you work at school? I think food that contains too much oil makes you get sick and that's what we have right now, but others think different and they have their reasons too. Although some say that the school's cafeteria should not change their food because the food that they are offering right now is especially made to make students work better actually, the school's cafeteria should change their food because it gives students more variation to eat and by having a healthier food less students will get sick.

Those who think that the school's cafeteria should not change their food have their reasons. One reason is that the food that they are offering makes students work better; this is because it has a lot of oil. Scientific studies say that oil awake people, and make people do their usually activies better. Also, students who have their test after lunch, and they have eat something that contains a lot of oil; they tend to get better scores than those who didn't eat at lunch; this might be because some of them can't think with the stomach empty, or it can be because oil really helps them concentrate, who knows right. The oil food doesn't sound that bad, isn't? but I will tell you next what is what I think that is bad about it.

There are many people who think that the school's cafeteria should change their food. This is because they have their reasons, one reason is to make students eat healthier; this will help prevent students get sick. There are many sicknesses caused by oil, and one of them is cholesterol; cholesterol can kill people if you don't know how to take care of it. Also, by preventing students get sick they will not lose any day of school, and that will help them have good attendance and they will not get lost in their important classes. For example: Science, Math and History.

Another reason to change the cafeteria's food is that it will give more variation for students to eat. This might sound simple, but by giving them more variation to eat; students will feel more free to explore food that they don't know. Also, students will feel more comfortable as if they were at home because you know that when you are at home food variate and that makes it fun. moreover, Variation of food will attract those who are more likely to stay out of the cafeteria; maybe they don't like the food that we have right now, and they are hoping that the cafeteria change the food. I think that by changing the food in the cafeteria will make a good impact in the school.

In conclusion, I think that the principal of my school should change the cafeteria's food because the variation of food will make a good impact in students who don't like to eat at lucn right now, and it will also prevent the majority of students to get sick. Eventhough those who don't want to change the food had a good reasons; ""The food that we have right now is made to make students be more active"". I think that the reasons to change the food are more productive for the improvement of our school.             ",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0

F2165F132C87,"Many students become participated in extracurricular activities to acquire a great educational experience. In addition, some students involved in activities that they don't have so much time to study or complete assignments. Finally, the students who participate in activities after school they don't spend so much time with their families in the afternoon. Some people argue that if students participate in activities they will focus more in what they participate; however this is the opposite because they can obtain help with their homework, and projects. Undoubtedly, sutudents involved in the activities of the school.

To start, many students become involved in extracurricular activities to enrich their educational experience. Most importantly, a student who wanted to overcome in life wanted a good education. For example, Generic_Name is a student with a great purpose in life, and he wants to study a career. He become involved in activities like staying after school while he was in high school because he wanted to improved in the school, and be a good student. As a result, he thinks that maybe is not necessary being involve in so many activities to enrich a educational experience. With a good behavior and good grades he will enrich in his educational experience. If he show good grades in class, then probably he will be better in his education. Not only the extracurricular activities enrich the education, being involved in activities allows a student to have little time to do homework assignments as well.

Additionally, some students become involved in activities like sports and they have little time to do their homework or study. A student who join in activities don't have so much time to finish their homework. Case in point, Generic_Name is a student she goes to high school, and she likes to play soccer. Generic_Name is very athletic she join in the soccer team, and she stay after school for practice everyday during the week. She is a smart student, and she likes to get good grades as well. Furthermore, when she get involved in the soccer team now she don't have so much time to complete homework assignments, and study. If she doesn't stay after school every day, then she probably will have more time to complete her homework. She thinks that it can possible to her because she shows interest in what she wants. Participate in activities allows to have little time to complete assignments, and allows to spend little time with the family as well.

Lastly, students who get involved in activities after school they obtain little time with their families. However, many students likes to participate in activities of the school. In particular, Generic_Name is a student who likes to participate in the activities of the school. She likes to participate in the class activities, games, and clubs. She likes to stay after school because she is participating in one club. She just stay after school on Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays. When she stay those days she pass little time with her family. If she doesn't stay these days, then probably she will have more time in the afternoon with her family. Plainly, the participation that she demonstrate in the sport she improve as athletic.

Some people say that involved in activities will impair some students because they can focus more in participating in activities, and not focus in their class grades. However, this idea is inaccurate. For illustration, Generic_Name is a student and he participates in a club where he obtain help with his homework, and projects. When he don't understand his homework assignments he go to the club. If he didn't participate in the club, then likely he will no receive help from the club. Therefore, participating in other activities the students can obtain help with their homework, projects, and improve their grades.

In conclusion, participate in activities can be helpful to some students. Many of students prefer to participated in extracurricular activities to improve their educational experience. Secondary, some students become involved in activities, and allows students to not have so much time to finish their homework. Finally, students who participated in activities after school they have less time with their families in the evening.

For example, if he asks advice from his best friend and his friend he would go with his best friend's advice because that is his gut feeling. He also knows if it's smart, or not. He knows he has to listen to his heart not his head.

Second, reason is he will have better opinions of advice, than bad ones. If he chooses older person and not younger person, it's because older people have more experience.

F3550CF50ABC,"Have you ever wonder how our character is formed? John Lubbock once wrote, "" Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I personally think that our character is formed by our friends, social media, and so that people can like us.

Many people believe that we choose our own character by being ourself and not caring what anyone thinks however, I think that our character is formed by our friends since were always with them. For example, if my friends are always skipping school and they ask me to skip school with them and I am going to say yes since, they are my friends. What most do us do is ,that we can not say no to our friends and by saying yes, it makes up our character because now people see us as a person who skips school.

Another reason on why our character is influenced by other people is, because of social media. Social media plays a big part on how our character is formed. For example, on social media there is a lot of models, and singers. A lot of young teens want to be like them so they will change the way the look and act. Since society has made it seem that if you don't look like Kylie Jenner or any other famous person that you're not pretty and because, of that people want to change their character.

Finally, our character is formed by who we are around is because we want people to like us. For example, if I am at school and I want to be friends with a group of girls I will do what they like and do what they do all the time so, that they can like me. Since I want them to like me I will end up changing my personality and look just so that they can like me; this makes my character be influenced by others.

I urge you to think about your character if it's formed by the way you choose or if it is formed by who you surround yourself with. We should not let people choose how they want our character to be. I personally think that our character is formed by our friends, social media, and so that people can like us.",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0

I have two examples, my family want me to be another person that my self, and the second example is if you want to be yourself in this world you will never find a job; You have to be another person the they want you to be.

I start with my family; How i said my family they don't like when you try to be yourself, they want you to be what they said, like jobs for your future they want me to be something the I don't want to be like: Soldier, Fireman, Lawyer, and president; I want to be someone else the they don't like to much, they don't like when I think in my self just what they want, they think if you are someone else you will have a big accomplishment.

In the case of jobs if you try to be yourself, and not what the company want you will never find a job; The happen to me alot of times when I try to apply to a job, they want you to be another person with different expression like: happy, active, team work, and accurate; If you are opposite of the expression you will never find a job with the expression the you have, so you have to be like the company want you to be and they would give you the job, then you will have a big accomplishment from the company because you are someone else.

That's why I'm agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, we live in a world the people don't like when you are yourself and they like when you are someone else; I don't think the accomplishment is just for be someone else and not yourself, if you try hard when you are yourself you will have the greatest accomplisment in life and for people who don't belived in their self like: Family, company, manager,people, and you; If you belived in yourself everthing will be good and the accomplishment would be often.",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,3.0

Most of us should set a realistic goal for them to aim; but sometime we aim too high and set an impossible goal that we can't accoplish it.

For example: some people aim to be perfect; but that's imposible because no one is perfect.

Some people will do so much work for no reason because if they don't have the materials or a plan for that impossible goal th,en they're wasting their time.

The danger of this is that no one will accomplish a single goal if they're aiming to high.

Many people try to get the results that they want; but many fall short.

Falling short on a goal can be a big danger, because it could lead many people to calling themselfs a failure.

This can also make people want to give up on what they were aiming for.

Everyone wants to be successful in life and not a failure, because if you're a failure, then you'll face many challenges and suffer.

F4FC2D64C127,"Inactive Times and Its Benefits

Should people have inactive times in their life? By doing work all the time people can achieve more goals; however, is better for people to have inactive times. It is better for people to have inactive times because they can have a longer life, fresh ideas, and get more energy.

Firstly, it is better for people to have inactive times because they can have a longer life. People's body works better when they have time to rest. For example, my mother's friend had a heart attack for not having inactive times. His doctor recommend him to have lazy times because he was working eighteen hours per day, but he did not listen to what the doctor said. As a consequence, he pass away; however, before he was told to have inactive times, his Neuron System stopped working properly. He stared having bad times at night while he was sleeping, his body started shaking, and he started having heavy breathing. The doctor asked my mother to talk to him and explained one of bad results, and that was death. Right after my mother's friend pass away, the doctor wrote on his blog about how not having inactive times can kill us. In sum, having inactive times help people live a longer life.

Secondly, it is better for people to have inactive times because they can have fresh ideas. When our brain is full of tasks we cannot think clearly and have new ideas. Being busy makes our mind blocked. For example, Generic_Name is a teacher and she is planning to have a party. However, Generic_Name is been so busy because her class is having a competition. All she thinks about is the competition and how to prepared her class. Generic_Name is not having inactive times and she does not know how to organized the party. She tried to focused on the party, but each small action was in vane. Her boss noticed she was tired and did not have new ideas, so her boss let her have two days off. During those two day Generic_Name could came up with lots of ideas to her party and also ideas to the competition. Generic_Name was happy because her main was full of new and fresh ideas. Her class won the competition and her party was amazing. In conclusion, by having inactive times people can get fresh ideas.

Thirdly, it is better for people to have inactive times because they get more energy. People who rest feel more energetic to start or finish an activity. For example, when I have many homework ,exams coming up, and track practice I feel upset, frustrated, and with no energy. So what I do is rest for a while to get energy. This make me feel powerful and energetic to finish my different activities. Furthermore, in my Psychology class I learned that people who rest or get an inactive time after they done with an activity for twenty five minutes have more energy to continue another task. In my personal experience, I have tested it on my sister and the results were successful. For example, She had to do an Algebra II homework and then, an English homework. So when she took the first twenty five minutes after she finished her first homework she said, she had energy to do the other one. We test it again without having twenty five minutes break. She said she was tired to do the next homework because she did not have energy. In sum, it is better for people to have inactive times because get more energy.

In conclusion, it is better for people to have inactive times because they can have a longer life, fresh ideas, and get more energy.

People can faced catastrophic result as death by not having inactive times and affect our life time. In addition, when people have lazy times they can came up with new ideas to complete different tasks. Finally, when people rest a certain time after an activity they get more energy. Each individual on earth must have an inactive times. ",3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0
F5817C081342,"Is a positive attitude key to success? Well, In my opinion I strongly agree, I believe a positive attitude will take you far in life and will let you accomplish many goals you've set for yourself. For instance having a positive attitude doesnt just affect you but it also affects others in a negative or positive way, for example motivation; you could motivate someone and inspire them just by doing you and accomplishing youre goals or you could even brighten somebodies day up by doing small gestures. In the other hand there will be people that dont want too see you do good, people that want to bring you down and people that have envy over you. That shouldn't bring you down that should be more motivation to do better because those are people who are jealous, people that are jealous of something you have and that they dont have. There are people who have started from the bottom with very little and are now doing big things, by having a positive mind set and believing in themselves. A positive attitude is the key to success all you need is to believe in yourself, have patience, and ignore all the ignorant people.

In my experience a positive attitude is a key to success, why? Well, when I was younger I had a difficult time with the English language because I only spoke Spanish at the time, which then resulted that I had to repeat a grade. Being left behind made me feel dumb and stupid, I also felt embarrassed; embarrassed of saying my age to the other kids when they would ask how old I was, I thought they would make fun of me and call me names. Through out the years I got more mature and I didnt really care no more about my age, I then found out that there were other kids that were in the same situation as me, which made me feel better about myself after.

When I got to high school I met my case manager, he was and still is a really nice guy and really cares about the students. When I met him he asked me many questions one of them was how old I was when I told him he was surprised because I was older then the other students. He then asked why I was 16 years old with freshmen classes, I told him why and he understood. A few days pasted by and he asked me how I felt being behind the sophomore class, I told him I didnt like it and how I felt a little dumb. He then told me how I would feel about graduating with that class, I then knew what he was about to tell me and I liked the idea of it. He told me I could do three years but I would have to do two years in one, I didnt care if it would be more work all I was thinking of was graduating on time. So, of course I accepted and now I am here taking my writing SOL with my positive attitude! If I didnt have a positive attitude I wouldnt be here right now, and for sure I wouldnt be graduating in May of 2020. Im very happy and thankful that I have this opportunity, and I know I will make it through this school year if I believe in my self.

The other night I was going through my Facebook feed and I stumbled upon a link that one of my friends re-post, on that link there was an article of a women that is from El Salvador, and that women use to live near to where we used to live. On that article it said ""First women Pilot from El Salvador"" when I first read it I could not believe what I was reading, I was very happy for her and I know she worked so hard to get to where she's at. It is incredible knowing a women from a country that does not have much to give is now flying in the air going around the world. Reading that article motivated me to set goals for my self and to keep on going, if she can accomplish her dream I can to.

I admire my mother, she's gone through so much and has risked her life to have a better one, not just for her but also for her family that she had to leave behind. Before she came to the United States her mother didn't want her to come she thought it was to much of a risk. My mom knew what she was getting her self into she believed everything would come out fine, the day my aunt was about to leave to Mexico my mother begged her to take her. My aunt would deny and deny her until she finally said yes. My mom packed up her stuff and left with my aunt behind her mothers back, but before she left she left a note for her mother saying if she doesnt leave now they'll never have a better future. My mother has walked thousands of miles and has nearly starved to death to get to where she is now. She worked her head off trying to make enough money to support her family, she had three jobs and as soon as she clocked out of one she would walk miles to get to the other one. Years later my grandma got her Visa and was able to come visit, she regretted doubting her and apologized for not believing in her. If my mom didnt have a positive mind set and if she listened to my grandma she would still be in El Salvador; washing her clothes in the river, eating beans and eggs everyday, and earning six dollars a day. She has a better life now then she had before, but she still has more to accomplish and I am here to help her. With her positively she can go far.

Therefore a positive attitude is the key to success, negativity won't take you anywhere all it does is let you watch others have fun while they enjoy life. Positivity allows you to set goals and to accomplish them. Many people have met their goal by believing in them selves, no matter how difficult it is they keep on pushing.

I believe attitude does have an impact on life choices, if you put no effort on a task your set to do, that task will never be done or it'll turn out horribly. A positive attitude is the key to success all you need is to believe in yourself, have patience, and ignore all the ignorant people. ",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5
F58DF8739B42,"Dear Mr. Principal today I want to talk abot how most employees are looking for a specific characteristics in potential employee even if they don't know the job. I agree with this prompt because a person not always know how to do a job, but they can learn.

Some people when they are new on a job they don't really know what to do, they have to be trainig for another person that alredy know the job like a manager, maybe employees are looking for a manager, the person they contract to be the manager maybe her/ him don't have the experience at all, but they can learn over the time they are working. For example when I came to this country I start to work with my stepfahter to put ruffin, I didn't know how to do the job, bit I learn over the time that I work with him. Last summer I was working on a restaurant like a cashier and I had a problem because I didn't know the differences on the coins because in my country it was really different, but I learn a lot because the manager from the restaurant help me to be succesful on the job, and I put a lot of eargerness to leanr the job.

A lot of people when they know the job they like to work hard becuase they want to learn more about it, some people that alreayd know the job they can learn new things about the job from another employee or manager. A lot of people here in United States work hard for the benefits of their family not just for a benefit to be hired, They know that if they work hard their childrens can leanr abot their experience, and they can be a better person, a lot of parents like to be a example for their childrens, so the way their childrens know that work hard is something that you need to be proud of. Some of them work hard to achieve their goals, or to have a better future.

However, be responsable is another important thing that you need to keep in mind, be responsable can help you to get hired on the job, if you are responsable the main boss are going to see that they need people that are responsable to be more succesful. A lot of companies grow up because their employee are responsable, and they complete all the activities their boss ask them to do. When I was in my country a lot of people tried to put like a store, but it never work because the people they put to work they didn't show up on time, and they weren't responsale on their activities, and the store had to close because they didn't improve what they want to do. Be responsable is one thing that is going to help you to be succesful in life becuase if you are new to a job and you show up on time they are going to see that you are really responsable with your activities and that's what most of the jobs are looking for people how are responsable.

Another thing that employers need to know that they have to contract a person that is going to have patient, in every job they have a manager and employers should know if the manager have the patient to be training people that is new on the jop. Lets do a example some managers are impatient they don't like to help people that don't know the job because they said that they don't have the time to be training people because they think that the person is never going to learn how to do the job, or they have another important activitie to do instead of be training a new person. In a lot of restaurants or stores the managers are always with good actitude and they like to help people.

In my conclusion I would say that a employee don't have to know how to do a job if they are responsable and they like the job him/her are going to learn what they need to do to be succesful on the job. Another thing is that you don't born with experiences you need to learn from the callenges life give to you and you can learn from your mistakes.",3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,2.0

F6886170FAA3,"I agree with first impressions are almost impossible to change, because this is one of the things that only happend one time, well it can happend again, but not at the same way than the first one. So you can not change it because that is what you felt at the moment when you experienced this feeling in your life and you will not want to change it because you liked what you felt and you might probably want to repeat it again.

Then it is like when you see someone on the street or in the city that is wearing completely different clothe or extrange clothes than you or than everybody around you, and he or she inmediatly is catching everybody's attention, because probably they never have seen someone like them before or they not normally used to see people wearin like that. Sometimes people might probably start talking about them like given own opinions, or some people just judge them because of their dreasing, others just are corious because they might probably want to know something about this people because they or their culture seem interested to them and the want to experience sort of activities with this people or have fun with them.

Constantly people experience this kind of impressions, because they normally are around so many people like their family, their friends, or even with people they not even not at all. So that make them to experienced this type of circunstances and because of that, is that they are exposed to experience this feelings at any time or anywhere. It do not matter because you going to see so many things and those things are going make you feel this way.

Inmediatly it do not matter where you go or where you are with, you are going to experience this, even with yourself bacause this always happend and you will want to go and to be talking of that with your friends or you might be probably get a clue and put it like an example and your life. Sometimes first impressions help you to be even better in life, because you will be thinking about it and you might start making something different on you because you saw something special on someone which you got first impression.

In conclusion first impressions normally will be impossible to change, bacause it is unique and you can not change that. You might can change the way you think of it and probably if you experience it again it will not be the same because you will know what it is already, and it will be like it is not making sense and you will wondering the reason why is this happening. Sometimes first impressions will help you to understand people or their kind of life they have, it do not matter the race because people have something different something that we might need.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5

Students effort to do their work. They when are absent, they stay after school with their teachers to complete their work missed. Some students praise when they need to do something good but they study first and then they praise to have good grade or something like that. They sometimes don't like to do their homeworks in breaks.

Students try to get more energy to do that. They are eat breakfast in the morning. They bring some snack to their house. They believe that students must be self-confident in order to learn. Some studens need help to their teachers and they help them. They need to organize their work when the teacher give some papers.

Students work all the time to get the best work. They study after school at home. They do their homework and they practice some exercise when they have some break or when they complete their all work. Some students go to the library and get some books to read about the class, they need to pass.

F6EAE029B20B,"Today world, everything start to moving forward. People start to invent the new ideas and those ideas make life more easily. In medical world, people make a new kind of medicine to cure the disease, compare to the old world a lot of people had die. In technology world, people put those ideas into the physical objects that it is so important for today life. From all we see everything is start from the ideas and who invent the idea? This is the kind of the question that no one ever ask. It is us the people that invent the idea.

People can make a change to the world if they start to think or we can call the attitude. The attitude of the people have a big impact to the surrounding. But not all the attitude have a good impact to the world it also have a bad impact. This is led to one of the controversial question from the science; that said do you agree or disagree that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. From my perception I agree that the positive attitude is the key to success in life because it make a people have a good communication in the community between people and people, make us being more productive on everything we do, developed our self and also things surround us quickly.

Everyday people need to make a connection to one another. And exchange the information from that connection. But the important thing is the way we thinking. Like in the school, there are a lot of student from different place and family. But some student is isolate and other is sociable. Most people think that the isolate student mostly are bad and the sociable student mostly are good. The reason that the student being isolated because there is something in the school that student can not accept so they become isolated. It kind like when you move from place to place you try to fit yourself in. It take time for them to being sociable like other student. This is not the reason for us to think that the isolate student have a negative attitude. And also not all the sociable student have a positive attitude. We can learn from the past that thing happen in high school led the student to commit suicide. The student that have a negative attitude like to bullying other student and left them no choice. For the student that commit suicide also have a negative attitude because they take the outside source seriously then them self. This is the small example that we can compare for what the meaning of the word attitude is.

People like to say that most millionaire are a bad person. We can not believe in this conventional wisdom. People sometime said the bad thing to other to make them self look good. But from what I see most millionaire have a good attitude because it led them to being more productive. Productive person is the person that you should be friend with. They always share the good things in their mind to you. Not just in the business world that have a productive person. Also in the community that we live in everyday. People we meet everyday that like to talk about the good things that happening to them. They share the idea how to get there and how to do it. It not means that they try to show off to you. Don't thing them wrong. We can see when the people get their new job, they like to share the idea . You just need to open your heart and listen to them. It might one day you can use this idea to do other things too. Also in the political world, a lot of Prime minister, President, try to keep them self productive by doing a charity to the poor people. This is why the world become smaller and smaller.

There are a lot of country in the world with a different culture, tradition and religion. And a lot of people know at least one language that is not their mother tough language. But also a lot of people that only know how to speak their mother tough language. When we were young, we spending time mostly in school and they teaching us the art, history, science, literature but the important thing is the language. We learn just one language and spending almost the ten years for us to able to speak. For those years, we learn the basic how to speak in a formal way. Also our parent watch our behavior and manner along the way. When we reach to the puberty, mostly everything is start to change. The important thing is the way we thinking. Everything that we been learning from our parent, teacher, friend, society start to root inside our brain and also define who we are. One famous quote from smart human that we call him Buddha said "" You are what you think you are"". This quote not designed just for his religion but for the worldwide. If you think you can become success, you will be success one day. If you think you want to be a doctor, you will become a doctor one day.

No matter what you say always say a good things to the people around you. No matter what you do always do a good things to the people around you. If you want the people to do or say a good things to you too. And everything is start from us the way we thinking. Positive attitude is an important key for all success in life. And for my experience whenever I feeling down, discouragement, disappointment, anxiety, hopeless I always repeat this quote to myself ""You are what you think you are"". So after that if I had a bad time I keep thinking to myself that I can get through it. Even you have a small chance to success just keep thinking to yourself that you can make it through. One student asked the teacher will I pass the test if I do not know anything and the teacher answer even if you know that you can not make it just go to the test center. When they hand out the test just do what you know. And after that you will know that you have at least 1 percent chance of passing the test.

Todays technology allows people to do many different tasks without having contact with others in a positive way. Technology today is now making it easier for us humans to do things and also showing us what the furture could look like in a couple of years. Why would this be a negative thing ? if people are just trying to make are lives easier. For an example lets say you need to get some where but fast and you don't have a ride there is now a app where you send your location and give the address to place you need to go and somebody will take you. Technology is such a great thing and its becoming greater each and everyday.

There are many different types of apps that you can download on your phone today for anything. lets say that your at home and your really hungry but you don't want to leave the house you can download an app called grubhub that will make sure you dont miss a meal. what is grubhub its an app that delivers food from anywhere. All you do is tell the person what you want to eat the location of the place to pick up the food and your address so they know where to drop it off. And its that easy this thing that we call a phone can make all this happen with a little bit of typing. these apps are for free too but it may cost for the food but not everything is free in life.

Computers are also a big part of technology. Computers and laptops are used everyday could be for school for work for anything. Computers help out a lot in school for anyone who needs to do research and any type of information he or she did not know about. Laptops are great aswell its a computers that folds and is for on the go great for anyone that travels a lot or somebody that works on computers alot. Laptops are becoming better everyday there are even touch screen ones some that fold backwards and its crazy to think about because what do you think is going to happen a couple years from now technology is perparing us for the furture.

Technology is making our lives easir each and everyday. With out technology I wouldn't be able to take this take I wouldn't be able to the police if I'm in danger.

F792FE4DCF1A,"I disagree with this statement because anyone can change their first impressions if you just give then time and a second chance instead of just seeing them mess up.

The first reason that you can change your first impression is just by giving them another chance that they can change becuase everyone deserves a second change when people mess up their first impressions you should be able to let them change it because even you might of mess up on your first impressions on a buissines meeting or even on a date and you do want them to remember your first impression they want to remember the time you changed your first impression to a better one to show people what you are really like.

The second reason is because it can be about a really important meeting and you messed up on your first impressions and the other buissines people would be like ""wow he messed up really bad on his first impressions"" and you want them to give you another chance so you can fix your first impressions so they so they can be like ""wow he really change from the first time he was here"". So give peolpe to change their first impressions.

The last reason is that your at your girlfriends house and you are eat with her and her parents and you mess up and the dad says

""his not the type of guy you should be dating"" just because you mess up now the dad does not like you anymore cause you mess up and we you go again you must change that first impressions that you showed them the first time and make it better so the dad doesn't hate anymore.

F7CBE1D11BF8,"Is true self-esteem caused by self-confidence or is it caused by achievement, are people right about what they believe that; self-esteem is caused by self-confidence or is self-esteem caused by achievements? Self-esteem is caused by achievements, although some people may believe self-esteem is caused by ""self-confidence"". I personally believe, self-esteem is caused by someone's achievement. By personal experience my self-esteem is caused by my own achievements.

True self-esteem is caused by achievements for example: We can say, an employee at Chipotle has recently been elected ""employee of the month"". People may say "" what does that have to do with self-esteem?"" It does have to do with self-esteem because, that person has recently been elected employee of the month, and is being rewarded for his achievement of being elected employee of the month for his hard work. Although some people may believe that; self-esteem is caused by self-confidence. I personally still believe achievement is prior to self-confidence, and it's the cause of someone's self-esteem like; being elected employee of the month, that is one feeling of satisfaction that person had for being elected employee of the month.

Next, it is possible that self-esteem could be caused by self-confidence. For example: there may be students that can't start off their day learning without feeling confident about themselves. They may not want to learn, because they don't feel the positive energy or enough knowledge to be able to cope with how they're feeling that day; whether they want to learn or they don't want to learn. Also, for example: I have a friend who can't learn if she doesn't feel confident. She starts distracting others around her, she starts interrupting class, because it is hard for her to focus and learn when she doesn't feel confident. Although some people believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem. I still believe in achievement being prior to self-confidence. Because in my opinion the second the student is done being praised; they will immediately go back to not feeling self-confident to start their day learning.

Finally, true self-esteem is profit to achievement. There is a vast of people around the world being praised for their achievements. Achievements include; If you're being praised for something good you've done like: getting a job, becoming employee of the month, helping someone by carrying their groceries to their car, if an elderly has tipped over in the street and need help getting up, these are the causes of true self-esteem. For example: Last year 2018 at my old school, Generic_school our cheer team felt true self-esteem to find out they had made it to finals. Making it to cheer-leading finals was a vast achievement for them, because it had been 5 years since our team had won finals.

In conclusion, true self-esteem is caused by achievement. By personal experience I can conclude that achievement plays a huge role in having self esteem, because my true self-esteem is caused by my own achievements, and due to others personal experience true self-esteem is caused by their achievement. Although some people may believe that; self-esteem is caused by ""self-confidence"". I personally believe, self-esteem is caused by someone's achievement.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0

It also helps me feel less nervous and helps me talk to people alot with my mouth close.

First, if you solve math problems more often, you will be good at organizing things. Solving math can make you think about spending time. It will create a thought about how you spend time. Eventually, you will learn how to spend your precious time wisely. Additionally, it will lead you to good decisions. Basically solving problems is like, when you have to make a wise decision. You have to figure out the best solution that you can think of. After that, this process can help your personal problems. We use math everyday to solve our personal problems. Math is not just a subject, it is teaching you life skills too. Solving math problems can lead to good organizing skill.

Next, If you do math, it can help your grades go up and get it more better. First of all, if you start doing math, your grade for math will be satisfied. Math subject requires a your time for studying and it takes your patients too. Taking the time to study for math always pays off. In the end, your grade will be good and it will be all worth it. Then, when your grade is good, you will be more relaxed and pleased with your life. When you have a bad grade, it really does feel awful and the you will be ashamed by yourself. But when you have a good grades, it just makes you feel better and good. Eventually, If do math more than usual, start doing it for your free time, you will be good at other school subjects. Every subject has little bit of math. For example, science is basically a different form of math. For me, figuring out math problems helps your grades get better.

Solving math equations is my talent, when you do math, I think you get more organized and your grades go up. For me doing math is like a puzzle, if get wrong piece you will have to try again and if did put in the right place you will get the solution. If you made mistake, you have to think again, learn from it and try hard to not make the same mistake again.",2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0
F7DF6ABE8573,"I strongly believe that technology is positive on human life because of all the effects it had on us in the past and present. Such as: technological advancements, you can talk to people easier, caused scientific break throughs which made us go further in life, and it also gave us security or protection.

The technological advancements are practically everywhere because everything we use is technology. It has helped us with new vehicles that could possibly be more fuel efficient and possible will create more safety in the cars since it's easy to hurt someone in a crash. It helped us in school and made us understand things such as looking up answers you dont know or checking when the next test is. It inspires people to think of other ways we can advance our technology state currently.

Its really easy to talk to people because it doesnt take that much effort in order to have a conversation. The news is one example because it tells us whats happening even if they are far away from us, we can still hear them. The weather could change into a disaster and they would tell us to evacuate. It allows us to talk to relatives that live in other areas or countries. It could let us see political debates and see whats happening in other areas.

Without technology we wouldn't have had any scientific break throughs because it moslty helped us with everything in life. An example of this would be us landing on the moon which is a important day for the people because it showed that we could do really big things. If people did not take the time to study and think about the different scenarios then we would not have those outcomes. It helps us by looking up something we dont understand on the internet and in five seconds you could finally understand whatever you were trying to look up.

One thing that makes us feel safe would be your own home but what if someone broke in and had bad intentions. There would be an alarm system that would ring and call the police to indicate that there was a intruder. It gives us security by giving us locks on important things such as banks so no one can enter it unless they knew your password or any other necessity.

Technology definitely played a huge role in our daily life and the evidence shows because everything we do involves technology or is something about technology. I strongly believe that technology doesn't stop human interaction but helps builds it up. I think this because we can text friends, text family, work on a project, or do school related stuff with it. If we keep on making up better technology or improve it then I believe it will make discover or invent big things that will push us into the future.",4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5
F84E5DEFC874,"Have you ever just sat down and thought, Do we really accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Some say sayings have a reason for example Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something"", Does this mean it is true because he said it? Or is it just something he wrote because it was his opinion?

I strongly agree with what Thomas Jefferson wrote, it's saying in little words don't be lazy, it's amazing how much can get done if we are always doing something. If we are always doing something other than what we want to accomplish it takes time and the process just gets longer. I believe that inactivity serves a purpose even though your inactive or active some or many things can be accomplished.

One reason I believe that inactivity serves a purpose is because, more can be accomplished when you are not active and working. I have experienced this numerous of times at my job. At my job,

we have task we have to get done by a certain time which is closing and sometimes those task don't get done due to how busy the store gets, when the store gets busy we can't get what we want accomplished, but say we are not active, or working and the place gets slow and calm. We have the time to get our task done and meet the requirements and leaving on time. When you are super active and busy it get hectic and that just adds more to your tasks. For example your making some food, drinks and theres more and more orders, you can't make something then clean your gonna have to keep going and clean it all up at the end when it slows down. In my opinion you get what you want accomplished when your less active in this case.

Another reason I believe that inactivity serves a purpose is because, when your not active you don't know what your gonna accomplish that day, but out of boredom your gonna get something out of it. This happens to me all the time where one day i'm just free all day with absolutely nothing to do, and i just lay in bed with a mess in my room not even thinking about the mess and all of a sudden I start cleaning everything and organizing everything. Like Thomas Jefferson says ""Determine never to be lazy... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something"" In this case it works both ways because if your doing something you get something accomplished and something good out of it, but if your doing absolutely nothing then you get nothing accomplished.

Lastly I believe that inactivity serves a purpose because, say your going to try out for the boys or girls soccer team and there is only 1 spot left. Obviously your going to need to practice everyday and know how to play. Practice makes perfect the more active you are with soccer, the more chances your gonna get that last spot to be a member of the soccer team, but say you really want the last spot but your just not as good as the others and it's a new sport you just wanna try out but you are not practicing everyday to get better. If you don't practice everyday to get better then there are less chances of you making that last spot just because you weren't as active and on it like the others. The more practice you receive the more chances you will have to get that last spot because of the dedication with no activity done theres no hope in that.

In conclusion, inactive or active you get through your day and learn something new and that is a accomplishment so much can be done in many different situations, anything is possible. At one point through your day you accomplish making it through even if you felt like you didn't accomplish anything you must have, because you learn something new that is the biggest accomplishment. Thomas Jefferson said that for a reason for sure. Everything has a meaning and reason behind it. ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0
F8776FDF7DC0,"Have you ever thought about what to bring on a trip to the park? I've, it's frustrating to pack an activity that everyone is going to like. There are multiple ways to have fun at parks for example, you can play soccer, explore the park, and play football with your friends and family.

First of all, when you're at a park you most likely want to have a good time with your family and friends. Soccer is a good way to relax. You may ask "" Why is soccer a good activity to relax?"" well, when you're playing soccer you can get your mind off things. It helps you think more on the game then what else is going on out side of the field. Also soccer is a good way to communicate with one another.

Second of all, you can play a game of football. Football is also a good way to communicate with one another. For example, in football if we want to win we have to have a good game plan. So, we have to gather our opinion and thoughts to make the right plan. Football is a good way to bring everyone together to communicate.

Third of all,

you don't always have to play a sport to have fun. You can go explore around the park. For example, you can go walk around, look at the beautiful trees and flowers, and go hiking. While you are also there you can take beautiful pictures!

To sum up, there are multiple activities you can do at the park. Think about other activities that you can do with your family and friends. There are many more than those three for sure. You also have to think about others too and what they want to do. Therefore, there are many other enjoyable activities out there. ",3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5
F886A2B6F351,"It's a good idea to have homework club at your school. Every school should have homework club at least three times a week. Homework club is a club where teachers help you with your homework or if you need help understanding a subject. Homework club helps students get to learn a little bit more about that subject, be more active with theirs friends, and it makes them have more confidence about their work. Homework club is a big help for students. There's so many stuff you can do at homework club and that is finishing a project with a friend, studying for a test/quiz, or even finishing your homework early.

At homework club you get so much help from the teachers. You can finish a project with a friend and when you do that it helps you be more active with that person. If a student ever has a doubt with a question about their project, then they can go to homework club and get some help with their project. The best part about homework club is that when more students come, we get to help each other with our projects. It's like a community were we help each other with any questions we have. Projects are really hard when you do it by yourself, but if you go to homework at your school then you will get all the help you need. If your having trouble then the best place to go is homework, so you can get some help.

Another thing you can get do at homework club is study for a test/quiz. The teachers will help you make flashcards, help you over the study guide, or even play a game of kahoot. If you didn't know what kahoot is, kahoot is a game where it helps you a lot before a test/quiz. I can say that kahoot is like a study guide but form into a game. Many students can't really study for a test/quiz when they are at home, because they can't concentrate studying when they are alone. So if you go to homework club they will help you study for your test/quiz and you will for sure not get distracted. I recommend everyone to come to homework club at least three times a week so you can get help studying for a test/quiz or if you need help with something else. If you go to homework club then you will pass your test/quiz, cause homework clubs will help you prepare yourself for your test/quiz

The last thing that homework clubs helps you is get your homework done early. the teachers will explain everything perfectly and I guarantee you will learn even more then what you learn in class. Math teachers, Science teachers, History teachers, and English teachers are going to teach students so much more. You can go to homework club and do your homework early so you don't have to worry about doing it at home. In homework club teachers explain the homework to the students but with more details. What I mean is that the teachers will teach you more about that subject.

Homework club is one of the best club their is. It helps students learn more about the subject, it also makes them have more confidence, and it makes them be more active with your classmate at homework club. Homework club is a community full of amazing students and teachers. There's so many things teachers at homework club help you with and that is Helping you get your projects done in time, helping you study for a test/quiz, and helping you finish your homework early. We can achieve this goal of establishing homework clubs in schools, but we need help from student to make this goal happen. Homework club would be boring and not helpful if we didn't have some amazing teachers at school volunteering for homework club. ",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0
F88A0801C9EB,"In my opinion it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age. If you're committed to anything you will always want to achieve that certain goal. Having a career you are committed to at a young age has many positive outcomes. One of the outcomes is you can find a career much faster. Another positive outcome is having a goal that you want to achieve. The final positive outcome is having more time in high school to do other activities. Having a certain career you want to achieve at a young age will make you improve on lots of things.

You will find a career much faster if you're committed to one specific career at a young age. If you are focused on that certain career you will be doing things that you need to achieve to have that certain career you have been planning at a young age. For example when you are committed to that one certain career you will be taking specific classes. Finally when you sign up for that career or try out for that career you will most likely get accepted since you will have experience. Having experience on a career will help you so much when applying for a career. People will most likely see that you have experience and want to hire you. That is why it is better having a career you are committed to at a young age.

If you have a goal you want to achieve at a young age you will do anything to achieve that goal you since you're committed to achieve that goal. It is also just like being committed to a certain career at a young age. For example in order to achieve a goal you will need to do anything it takes to achieve it. As in a career you need to study as much as you can of the career and take classes that will help you achieve the career you are interested in. If you have a goal you will most likely achieve the goal if you try and never give up. If you give up on the goal you will not succeed. Just like in a career you are committed to at a young age. If you give up on the career you will most likely need to find another career and learn new things and start all over. That is why you should have a career already planned at a young age so you won't give up later on and need to start all over.

You will have more time in high school to do more activities if you are committed to a certain career at a young age. For example in high school their are many sports , clubs , and other after school activities you can do or tryout for. If you already have a certain career in mind since you were little and young you can have more time to do sports and other activities that can also help achieve that certain career you are interested in. Also it is good having more time to do other things instead of still not knowing what career you want and having to speak to counselors , teachers , and searching up careers you are interested in doing. If you already planned your career when you were young you won't have to worry about having to look for a career and having to stress out. Some students stress out if they don't have a career in mind and not knowing what career they want to do. Having more time to yourself and not needing to worry about finding careers is much better than looking for careers and needing to take new classes to have that certain career that you are just planning to have. That is why it is better to be committed to a career at a young age.

Overall having a career to be committed to at a young age is better than not having any career planned out for the future. You will get the career quicker than usual. You will have an achievement you will want to accomplish. You will have a better schedule to do and focus on other things. This will improve lots of your characteristics and improve you as a person. It will show you how committed you are and how you can get anything done. When you get the career youve been committed to since you were young you will be proud of yourself since you have been committed and focus on that career like all your life.

F8C7B0C9F064,"Some businesses and schools around the world have adopted a four-day of work week to conserve resorces and energy. Although some say that my school should not adopt a four-day of school week and should not extend two hours of school day to conserve resorces and energy because we dont use our resorces and energy in vain , actually my school should adopt a four-day school week and extend two school hours to conserve resorces and energy because we will have a better environment and we will administrate energy.

Those who believe that my school should not adopt a four-day of school week and should not extend two hours of school day to conserve resorces and energy have their reasons. One of the most disputed reason is that, our school does not use it resorces and energy in vain, beause we use energy and resorces to facilitate our studies and to have better opportunities to learn. And they also say that if we have a four-day school week wont make any change.

However, my school should adopt a four-day school week and extend two hours of school day because we will have a better environment. According to an article written in my county says that, ""The used of resorces in my school has increased by 70%. Even more, it says that because the over abuse of resorces in our school the amount of trees cutted has enhace around our county and its harming our enviroment."" That is giving a bad reputation to our school and county because our school does not recycle and reused our resorces .

Also, my school should adopt a four-day school week and extend two hours because we will administrate energy. The using of computers, smart borads, and all kinds of technological devices in our school have increased, do to the extraordinary amount of students our school possess. Our school has the biggest amount of students in all the county. So, do to the amount of students in our school the use of computers has increased. According to an save energy a webside, ""80% of schools energy is used in computers and other technical divises."" By having a four-day school week and extending two hours of school day will limited the used of computers and it will make our school better.

many people have say that my school should not adopt a four-day of school week and should not extend two hours of school day to conserve resorces and energy because we dont use our resorces and energy in vain. But as you can see adopting a four-day school week and extend two school hours to conserve resorces and energy will be benefial to our school and to our society.

F8F503B765DA,"i say that we shoudn't have more hours of school , because it will just make us be more sterssed b working. we wil barly have free time to o what t do but more time time in school wil make us tired and weak we will need more food. it will cost the school more food and it wil cost more money and light to wast on teaching. Kids won't learn because they are going to say why did they put more school time and thats all they are going to say the the whole time. It will make it all more busy for the teachers they will get mad and say how they can't do that much hours they got kids they got thing to take care of.

The school will need to whas't more money on food and electicion bill just for one more hour of education and kids won't even learn alote because they will be to busy complaining and say that they want to go home. the school board will just was't money for no reason. school is doing good already so do not mess it up by an hour of school. The teacher will work more time ,so they will get paid more. So if u do put one more hour of school if a kid needs to stay after would they stay an other hour of school that would mean that the teacher would gets a bigger pay cheack and that would be alote of students so teachers would have to stay for ciuds to so that would be longer and by the time its done it will be dark.

The school will need more volnenters because they don't want to pay teachers more already because they already do because they have an other hour of school left so they will have to beg the teachers to volnter to to stay. School will need to think of more thing to do in the school to fill up the hour.

we will not want to go to school. we will be so tired and and to know that we have an other hour of school i would be done for the day. I would not feel like going to school every day because i would be more tired . it will give me less free time to us because we got sleep earlyer because we are tired.

we will get mad because we don't got free time alote and that would effect our school day. Kids will feel that school is to much work and might tell there parents and the parents might tell the school to lower it down. The school will will get complans form parents that there kid is stressing to much so that would be bad and school will have to cancil the one hour. Thats why i think it is a bad idea to put one more hour of school all of the people will disagree i would to because it will just make me stressed out and give less free time. I think school should leave the hours alone since they don't have to deal with the work and tired ness they don't have to think twice.

I think it is dumb to add an hour more because it can mess up every thing. If every thing is doing good then it should stay like that if we need to change it we should all chose if we want a to have one more hour or not. We are the important voteers so why leave us out of it. We are the ones who get tried ,so one more hour and 30 mintues is not good for are bodys even worse if you have after school or a clud. The money that you had to use for the extra time could go to better things like new computers for us. Or it could help for better lunches or better gym oqupment or mucic things and make the school better by painting it or somthing. Instead of was'ting it on one hour of paying teachers. I would like to have free time not streeing out about doing work and being done and haveing little free time.

F9072F36ECE7,"Dear Business Manager.

First of all this essay is written with the meaning of what kind of occupations I would like to do as student, which is good to know that there is someone that is interested on helping students like me, also as student I would like to start by the right way and taking what is the best for me for example what is going to be a job which will make me feel comfortable to know that my qualities and my knowledge will play an important roll depending of the job that I might get.

To tell you more about what I like to do is simple and easy at the same time, it doesn't matter how hard something it gets for me because in the end I always end up pulling through, althought I like to think before make a choise because is always hard when I do stuffs at the very beginning with no concern or knowledge of what am I suppose to do.

In this case, as a beginner I get excited no matter what the work it might be, I can tell that I'm not afraid to begin with new chalenges. So one of the reasons you should invite me for job oportunities is because unlike the rest of my partners at school they don't have the spirit of a fighter like I do, because I always try to give it all I've got because I know this is my heart and like my dad told me ones if ""if you don't fight for it don't expect for the things that you want to come for you"", and to prove myself that I can be someone on this world having a good job and be respected for it,so I can be able to support myself and my family as well, work hard in every little single thing I do is what I have to make sure that I can be capable and responsible of doing it.

In the other hand let's say that at least for now I want to graduate from high school, then go to college to start a career of mechanic, because mechanic is the number one on my checklist in other words my favorite, however this is would it be a big opportunity if you actually choose me for the job opportunity, because as it is for me this is going to be a really good starting for me, after all I think I can show you what I mean by saying I don't give up because my father always told me when I was a little kid; no matter what happens after I had to give it all, never leave a little bit of what I could let on my effort, also because he is been a great example for me since I was a kid or since I remember my childhood. Instead of being a bad boy, he showed me what do I have to to with my values and things that really matter to me, so that is pretty much of what I can be capable of when it becomes to a responsibility.

Persistent is other word that goes with my personality, if you want someone who really want to do something when it becomes to work, I think I might have the qualities that you are looking for any kind of job. So that's my response to what you might be looking for, i just hope that you can choosr me, Thanks.    ",3.0,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5

Students disagree that the school board should not add extra time to school each day because students Parents have job so they have to watch their siblings for this parents to work and so that they have money to buy food and clothing, pay bills, students like's to watch their siblings because its fun playing with them, watching you're siblings Is a lot of responsibilities because you have to watch them so they dont get hurt, you also have to feed them so they're not starving, and you need to change their cloths so they're not dirty, cleaning the house Is fun while yo're siblings are sleeping because there will be no destruction. You're parents dont have to worry about cleaning the house after they get home.

Being In high school sucks because there's so much stuff that you have to do like home works but projects are tough, home work Is fine but Its too much of works, but you have to do you're home work to keep youre grades up and so that It dont go down, projects are tough so you might want to ask you're friends for some help, youre gonna want to do your projects because If dont you're grades will go down, Studying with you're friends are fun because you're getting to know them more and you can all hang out, passing highs school is the best part because you're parents will be proud of you.

F9E1434B2151,"Throughout the course of our history,education has always been placed amongst the most important necessities,as it not only helps us learn and better ourselves,but because it also opens new doors and possibilities for us. In the past,schools couldn't offer differing alternatives,because technology wasn't as present as it is today. Schools can now offer education to students,all while being at different locations. By students taking classes at home,they'll be able to benefit because they won't feel as socially distressed as they would in person,the level of education could be better and possibly help them graduate earlier,and they wont't have to endure social issues, such as bullying. Many people tend to believe that because they go to school,they won't have a hard time adjusting and fitting in with the masses,but to contrary beliefs,there's a lot of people who do struggle with social anxiety and overall,tend to have a hard time fitting in. Firstly,an example of this, is my cousin Generic_Name. He does have friends,but he feels extremely overwhelmed by being around so many different people,mostly because he's always struggled with social anxiety. Generic_Name decided that he would still like to pursue and attain his education,so he started looking for different alternatives that could help him do so. After much research and gathering of information,he concluded that distance learning was the best choice for him,as he wouldn't have to endure overwhelming amounts of people,or feel pressured by the constant necessity of having to wake up early during the mornings. Another example would be my friend Generic_Name,who never really had problems of fitting in and making friends,but overall disliked the whole ordeal of the school system itself. She then decided to pursue her education through another medium,that medium being,distance learning. Secondly,what a majority of people don't tend to realize,is the fact that you could achieve a better education,and even graduate at an earlier rate. This is another benefit of distance learning. Many people tend to believe that attending school,actually decreases their chances of being able to graduate early and of becoming more independent from their families at a younger age. Many individuals throughout the course of the world,utilize distance learning because they would like to achieve their educations at a faster pace,than those who are enrolled in schools. A prime example of this,is my friend Generic_Name. He was an excellent student while at school,but he wanted to find a way of being able to take advanced courses,that not only prepared him for college and provided him with advanced credits,but also helped him graduate at an earlier age. Generic_Name is now a professional,with a degree in marine biology. He achieved these accomplishments,all at the young age of 25. Another example would be my other friend,Generic_Name. She had always excelled at school,but she wanted an alternative that provided her with a better education and a chance of being able to enroll into college at a younger age. After much thought and consideration,and much conversation with her family and peers,she ultimately decided that distance learning was the best choice. As of now,Generic_Name has graduated at the young age of 17,and is estimated to graduate out of college at the young age of 19. Finally, an issue,that as of now,still affects many schools around the world,is bullying. Bullying has been an issue that has always caused concern amongst the masses,and sadly,it's an issue that is still ongoing till this day. Among the many issues that affect public schools throughout the whole world,bullying is still one of the most commonly and frequently mentioned. Despite the benefits of not feeling pressured,being able to pursue a better education and graduating at an early age,distance learning is also an alternative that many people, who've unfortunately been victims of bullying,provides them an opportunity of being able to continue with their studies,and a feeling that they are no longer exposed to issues,such as bullying. An example of this,is my friend Generic_Name. During his first couple of years in high school,he was brutally mocked for always standing out amongst his peers,and he not only felt massively insecure, but he also developed many social problems and insecurities. He had tried many alterning ways of possibly pursuing an education without having to worry about being mocked,until he finally discovered distance learning. He discovered,that he could still attend his classes and carry on with his regular school activities,all while being at the comfort of his very own home. Luckily for Generic_Name,his bullies actually turned out to be massively underachieving,so much so,that they ended up being expelled from school. He then decided to return to school,and luckily for him,he started to fit in. If it wasn't for distance learning,Generic_Name wouldn't have graduated his freshman year,or his sophomore year. People shouldn't really be afraid of trying alternatives that differ from the norm,they should always read and educate themselves on the pros and cons of distance learning. As technology continues to expand beyond realms we could've ever have possibly imagined,the future of education could one day narrow down to distance learning. ",3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.0

Its awful that people do communicate to each other anymore its just threw texts and that is horrible its not professional. and playing games every day or on devices is a bad thing and good in the same time.

You can get sick if your always on ur devices just watching the screen for hours so its bad. When i got my first phone i was always on my phone non stop just texting watching videos i wouldnt stop all i would want would be all my devices i wouldnt sleep i would go to sleep around four in the morning.

Cars can be bought online you don't need to go to the dealer ship you now just get your computer and look for the you want and they can deliver the car right to your house .Also we have Tesla which are cars that are electric and you charge them instead of putting gas in them and also they this feature called Autopilot which means the cars drives by it's self and all you have to do is pull that switch on and then just have your hands on the steering wheel for safety reasons but they are trying to make it where you only have pull the switch and just look out the window also they are very fast it can beat a Lamborghini and when you brake you are charging the battery .But also people are losing their jobs because of this but they can also work using technology instead of working at a store they work at a Amazon factory plus they pay very well .So what do I think of technology I think it's awesome because it gives you new opportunity's that we use to not have when technology did not exist. And it's changing not only the world but also the universe because we have technology everywhere like in the moon we sent a Tesla Roadster and we also have satellites in the sky that tell us what happening in the sky.,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0

Also the student need to came to school for learn and be a good person and them they can work after school.

Ruler the school dont want the student just came for two day. Because one of disadvantages is they are not going to make a great grade . Second because the students are not coming school, and they dont know what the teachers are began doing during class with the other student and they will have a bad grade for not coming and dont doing the work for the classes.

FAC0A72D62EE,"Churchill's statement is important to American lives. Currently, people who fail always gets back up to keep on reaching for the goal they want to achieve. However, when people fail, they think they should give up and stop trying. It's important to discuss about these different sides. Churchill's statement is important for not giving up or quitting.

The first reason why we should never give up is that we learn from our mistakes. when you fail at something you have to understand that it's not the end of the world. If you don't get something right or you mess up on it, you'll know to get it right next time. It's always important to recognize that you can reach for you're goals to be successful. when you fight for what you believe in, you'll never go wrong.

The second reason why you should never give up is because you want to reach you're top goals. When you want something, you have to fight for it. People who fail or didn't do something right, they give up and say that they have wasted their time, But in life, we can't always win or do something right. we are bound to fail at some point in our lives and it doesn't feel good. However, we keep on pushing for it because we want to be successful and feel great about ourselves to know that we didn't give up.

On the other side, when people give up, they have fail. People who think they have what it takes to be able to get a job, being able to go to a good school, or pursuit their dreams without mistakes, is someone who's going to give up the moment they've fail. The people who got great jobs or got into a good school, worked hard for it. Even when things went bad, they didn't give up because they work hard for that purpose. Some people who fail, often say that they're not smart or not that good. If your not that smart, how are you here today? When you struggle on something, you have to understand that the people around you are the people that can help you with deal with you're problems. Friends and families are the people who can help you in your time of need.

Finally, whenever you have a goal or something you want to have, it's important to never give up or quit halfway through. A goal is something you want to have and by working hard, you know you'll able to reach it in no time. Whenever you get stuck or something goes wrong, you always have support from the people you know very well to help you. By not giving up on what you're trying to reach, you can be able to feel confident about yourself and be able to be confident through life.         ",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5

Ever since I was a little girl I have dreamed about going to Europe and exploring it. All the articles and social media posts I have seen or read about this place make it seem as though it is the greatest place on Earth. If I ever get the opportunity to visit any place on Earth I would I would decently choose Europe. I would love to experience their culture and try new things while there. I would also go sight seeing and exploring every second I could.

The first thing I would do in Europe is try out European food. I would go to a small town or city and ask the locals where their favorite place to eat is and what it is that they like to order there. After eating I would go around the town I was in and talk to the locals about what it's like to live in a place like Europe. Another thing I would like to do while there is try out their fashion. I would go to different designers and ask them about the difference in the fashion from Europe to the one in the United States is. Lastly, since it is a special trip I would treat myself to a shopping spree.

The most important thing I would be doing while there, is going sight seeing to famous places. Firstly, I would go visit the notorious Mona Lisa I have been dying to see in real life. Secondly, I would go on a walk to visit the Eiffel Tower. While there I will take cute pictures to post on social media for memories. Lastly, I would visit a bunch of art museums and look at paintings sculptures for hours on end.

In conclusion, If could visit any place in the world I would visit Europe. Everything about this place is astonishing and I would one day like to enjoy that myself. Coming from a small city named Covington, it would be a huge change in scenery for me. I would love to experience their culture and try new things there while visiting.

I think that some students in our country can benefit from able to attend classes from home, but I would do not agree because, the student can be more benefit to attend classes in school. For example, the students can practice deports that they like, the student can not feeling bored in classroom, and the students can take elective class, or academy. However, some students would do not like choose the offer distance learning as as an option for students to attend classes home by away of online or video conferencing. Just the student do not have other option to take credit for graduate.

First, the students can practice deports in the school because, the most students love practice deports and the school give then these opportunity . It is a passion to make what are you like. For example, when I feeling sad these the form how I can distract me, entertaining and I feeling good because, I can share with other people my passion for soccer. The practice deports can help most students to not consume drugs, or participate in gang. The young need a different world where they can have more opportunity to realize the dreams.

Second, the students can not feeling bored in classrooms. All students like to feeling motivate, happy, and entertaining. They do not like to be all day in one computer, or landlocked in home, so these the reason that the students like to going school because, they can share with their friends and know new people. For example, when I confused ,or need help with my homework I can ask my teacher, or my partner. we can travel to know the university, teather, and museo. We can learn about our history.

Finally, the students can choose elective classes, or academy. One of the reason that the students want to take elective class is because, they can to know what are their like. All schools in our country have elective classes, or academy about: kitchen, piano, cosmetology, art, fitnes, medical assistent, dentist, band, police, detective, electrician, and medical emergency . These class can teach us to find what are you want to study in your future. Only in school you have these great opportunity for know how you can to take a credit in a bank , or how you can they help for your university, how you can applicate for a beca and choose wich university do you want will going to study your career. For example, in my schools they help to know what a I want to study and they help to take a credit for my university .

In conclusion, some students do not like choose the offer distance learning as as an option for students to attend classes home by away of online or video conferencing because, the most students like practice deports in schools, the students can not feeling bored in classes, and the students have the opportunity to choose elective classes, or academy. However, some students do not have the opportunity to going a school because, they do not have family, others have to work and they do not have time or car to going a night school, and do not have other option for graduated that accept the offer to attend classes from home by away of online or video conferencing.

FC211F7815F2,"Studies have shown that one way to improve student achievement, is to start an afterschool homework club. Students stays for homework help, finish their homework early, and turn in their homework on time. So ,we all have our homework to turn in on the next day. They're a lot of students that do their homework, dont do it, or some students might said, ""I forgot my homework.""

Should people bring their homework to school? Of course, or what, you're just going to leave it at your house and forget to bring it at school. Always do your homework and do your homework at home or afterschool. On the next day, just prepare to turn in your homework and if you forget to bring your homework, ask your teacher and give a good reason why you left your homework. Then you can turn in your homework on the next day.

People need help on their work. That's why they needed an afterschool homework club. They can go to their teacher to help what they need. If they go to afterschool and get a good helper, then they can be better and will know what they learn at afterschool. We can improve all of the students to get a good knowledge and success, to be a good students.

So students needs to turn in their homework and get a good grade. So, if you want that grade, you have to achievement and pass the class and get good grades. Turning your homework is one of the important grades to success and go your grade up. You can help other students that needs help on a subject. Why, because helping someone will learn from you and they will know how to solve a problem. They might do something and turn in. That's why people needs a good grade and be smart on something they known.

FC5120C98AE7,"I think that all schools should offer video or online conferencing as well as online education form the school. Students should be able to be comfortable from where ever they are, and learn in a manner that they are comfortable with. There maybe different reasons where students may not come to school. However, if they do miss school students can have the abillity to turn in work and learn about what they missed. This would be good and better for teachers because students would have no excuse of them not turning in there work late or at all.

Students may miss school for all types of reasons, for exmple students can miss school for an urgent reason or a family situation. Some familys don't have enough resources to live off a good life, so, some students can't make it for school and have to work to support there families. In some cases familys have younger sibilings that they have to take care of, but the family can't afford to stay home and have to work. In that case families make students stay home to baby sit a little brother or sister. Students miss the education they need, and that's a good reason why they should have online based learning.

Having said that students may also be very sick and may not be able come to school. Students may also have variuse injuries that can be hard for them to move in certain areas, therefore they stay home and miss school. students could be in the hospital, and may not return to school for a long period of time, it could also be hard for them to transition back and catch up with his or her school work. Some students may be takeing care of a sick relative and my not be able to make it to school. online base learning would be very helpful to those students that are injured or sick.

Students also tend to leave the country, and go back to their countrys. Families make arrangements to visit their home countrys in the middle of the school year. in some cases families don't come back for long periods of time. Students tend to miss a lot of school work and education in the time they are gone. Online based learning would come in handy in this situation. Students could have fun where they are, and not miss a single assiegnment or a day they are learning something new.

Online based learning is the best solution to students missing school. It would be a great oppertunity for students to get back on track and finished what they started. I would recommend online based learning because I think of the families that are in deep need by the students that come to school in helping their families. I also think of the people that are sick, and that need rest at home. This program would help a lot of students get the education they need without worrying they won't get it.

This made me go harder for what I want to became in life I really put all my effort into something I love playing since my childhood , it always kept me from trouble and ending up in the street. I remember when I was 13 years old I use to play for a really good team that I never thought I could make but I did and never had a changes to play on the field because the coach thought I wasn't ready to play. He use to doubt about my ability on the field and that put me down , I left the team then stop playing for 6 months but I was start to think that I shouldn't give up and 2 months later I made Super Y where all the good player are at and good teams .

only played 6 games and i didn't do good or bad but I did alright and one of the coaches love my playing style , he got me on a travel team. My first season was where I proved everybody wrong and scored 38 goals 16 assist , I was proud of myself for not giving up and kept my head up from what I was going thought , Next season I got called up to play for the first team I was amaze for what I accomplish in a year. It was amazing when I played for the first team because I went to tournaments that were big like the state cup and college showcases I never experience , my team came in first place for two season and almost won state cup. The next year I made NPL and been getting mail from academy team and one team from Spain to go play for them but I lost those changes and that when I just stop giving up because money was a issue and I was begin to get in trouble that when I lost it all the hard work for nothing. I had my hope up for things to get better and one day I was listing to my coach , he told me I was a amazing player and I changes the game every time i'm on the field then he told me dont give up on something you really good at cause I can see you going pro or playing division one soccer and get draft from there , so I listed and now I got 5 division one school that went me to play for there school and some others.

Problems make your brain to grow up, imagine being on a math test and you don't know the answer, probably you will be scared but if you try hard to remember what is the answer you will find it, usually problems are too hard to solve and this fact helps you to make your brain to think a way to solve the problems, this can cause your brain to grow up by using all your energy to think in what you can do in this situation.

Problems gives you knowledge, there should be a reason for you to be in a problem, if you fight in the school or anywhere with another person or you do something bad, probably someone will call you to the office or take you to the police department , if you are in a problem the first thing you will do is think on why this happened and this helps you because you will know what you did bad and will not do it again.

Problems makes your personality stronger, if you crash your car you may feel bad and scared for this event, I had a test that it was hard and in that moment I felt bad, so most of the time when you have a problem you will feel stressed, this stress can be bad for your brain but it can also help you to be more patient and determined in your goal that is solving your problem, with this two things your personality will be stronger that before the problem.

In conclusion, I think that Duke Ellington is right because problems can help you by making your brain grow up, giving you knowledge, and making your personality stronger.

FEAF4F517583,"To begin with, there are different opinions about to do something beyond of what we have already mastered and for that reason we will never grow. Some people idea is that if they have already their master they will stop there, but thats not the point. I believe that we have to keep trying and learning until the end ; for example, if you never try something different you will never grow. Im agree with author Ralph Emerson and here are my reasons why:

One reason, is you will have more experience. Experience make people rich and I am not talking about profit.

For example, if I go to apply for a job and I just have a high school diploma because all I wanted was a high school diploma, but there is another applicant that have more than a high school diploma he also have a diploma as a plumber. This applicant have more experience and more masters, he prepared himself more than me , so he will get the job. Sometimes in life we have to be ambitious in a property way.

I am agree with author Ralph because learning differently means growing. The reason is I will be more mature, for example ; I will gain more mature because I have learned based of my mistakes, moreover will be easier for me than another person that just stayed with the easiest. There are many people that give up at the first try; although, life is not easy but at least dont give up at: the first, second and the third try.

Another reason why trying something new of what

I already have is I can reach more goals; in other words, at this time in society your value depends a lot on what you have, you can more privileges if you have more goals earned. For example, my goal is to be a police officer but after I reach my goal I will keep looking for a highest range, and that will make me grow: economically, physical and mentally. In addition, while you are mastering new goals you will be growing at the same time.

In conclusion many people is not agree to this idea because many of them like the easier, but the easier is not valuable .There will be many obstacles, and people will think that is the end; consequently, they will not grow sufficiently to know that the most they try the most opportunities of gain they have. However, in my opinion is never late to continue learning because;

''The more we learn that more we know,

and the more we know the more we grow''.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5
FEE662801AF4,"I think that homework clubs are good in school because, the students can take there time and procces ,to get to undersatnd, there homework, students can finish early thier homework and dont have to do it later, teacher can help more and teach more if thats there passion; what they like to do; to teach and want students to get good grades in there class or any class.

Some students might not understand the home work or just cant cach up. Students in homework club can cach up or even can be finish with the unit that they are working on. Some students can be cached up a lot and help the one's that are not or the ones that cant go.

For the teachers. teachers that like showing kids more education, teachers that like helping students when there stuck in a problom, tachers that can stay after school that dont have nothing to do or dose not have children. Those type on teachers can actualy enjoy after school homework clubs. teachers that actualy like there work can go because some teachers is just there to teach, leave, and get there money but some, actualy do like it they like helping when there wrong giving them corrections.

Students can finish there home work early. children sometimes cant do home work at home because they might be to busy or has a lot of activitys go after school like soccer, basball, basketball, ect. Some children might be able to go to after school home work clubs if there are after school buses but cant if there wernt home work clubs they would not be able to do there homework because, when they get home they have to take care of there brothers and sisters because mom works all day or sometimes parents might get sick and need them to take care or them. But after all i think its good to have after school homework clubs to finish or get to understand if you dont. Sometimes when theres time left and you did your home work and there like 20 or 10 minutes left they can show or teach you new topics.

FF190BD8380B,"My grandma always said, "" Is ok to fail, the only thing that matters is to stand up and keep trying."" A decision is the act of deciding something, as a controversy or question, by reaching a conclusion or making a judgment. If people take their own decisions, they are going to benefit. People should take their own decisions because it is a right, people can learn for the consequences of their actions, and people have the ability to think by themselves.

Many argue that people should visit a guidance to take decisions because guidance may have more experiences solving problems. However, they are wrong because in the past people fight and die for rights, and now that everyone have the privilege to talk for themselves they are not going to let others to decide for them. Clearly, people do not need to visit a guidance in order to made a good decision.

Initially, citizens have the right to take their own decision. For instance, Generic_Name, who is a citizen of the United States, wants to get the divorce because he found his wife cheating on him. To specify, he went to the court to get the paperwork done for the divorce. To detail, he have the right and the privilege to get the divorce because it is human right; he do not need the help of any guidance to made this decision because is something too personal. One should observe that taking decisions is a right that everyone is able to reach.

Additionally, people can make mistakes, but they have the capacity to emend them. For example, Generic_Name, for peer pressure, take a wrong decision about using drugs. To add, she realize that what she did were a wrong decision, and she understood that is bad for her health and she staunch doing it. Clearly, society can make people do what they do not want, but is in one to say: no; and fix what they did wrong.

Last, but not less important, everyone have different ideas and points of views, and because of that people should make their own decisions. For instance, Generic_Name's parents teach him to differentiate between good and bad; that means that he is not going to be in troubles for a bad decisions. To illustrate, he do not need the help of others to make a good choice. Obviously, humans are unique and sometimes people do not going to agree with others, but that does not means that one is wrong and the other is right; people need to respect others decisions.

In summary, taking decisions is a privilege that ancestors gave us, people are going to made mistakes in order to success, and everyone is qualify to talk by themselves. These prove that citizens should not need to see a guidance in order to made decisions. People must respect others points of views and do not judge them for what they do. There is only one choice: respect and always have present that no matter what others said you can do it!",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5
FF76D397A73C,"Not all the types of success have to be kind of hard to reach...sometime you just have to give a look in what are you good in one thing.

According to the Minister Wistom Churchill from Britain about the phrase tha he said

""Success consits of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiam""

is 50% percent true and 50% percent wrong.

For example a person who reached the success in hard way is the now trending disigner of the brand

""Off-White""

he said on a nterview that ""it wasn't easy to be in here that I'm now you know?"" cause when ll this started I didn't had help so i find my own help with the company/brand Nike to use some of they sneakers to make my shoes design come true, i didn't have the answer of they in one day- NO! I tried and tried to get one response until one day that they say ""Yes we're working together, you can use all of our sneaker desing to make your work"". Now the colaboration between Nike and Off-White in a trending colab now in these days.

This example is a hard way to reached the success but now we are going to see two cases of ""easy success""

Two exampe of ""Easy succes"" are the actress Natalie Portman and the Ex-Proffessional Boxer Mike Tyson,they got their success cause they are naturally borned talented.

For Example the case of Mike Tyson, he was a 12 years old fighting in the streets to gain some money for his family till one day a man saw him fighting with an older boy with him in which fight Mike won, the man saw in Tyson a potential legend in the world of the Box.

Another caseis the case of the famous actress Natalie Portman, she has been a talented actress since she was a little girl. One day a friand of her mother told to Natalie to make a try to win a paper in a Hollywood movie in which Natalie won because she was naturally born a proffessional actress, she just make her future with her talent.

In conclusion not all the success people made their success with blood, sweet, and tears, some of them just were talented or used their pros to be somebody important in this world.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,2.5
FFD29828A873,"I believe using cellphones in class for education us only is good/bad idea for students.

I believe some students learn easer on technolegy then paper ad pencil, but i also believe cellphone could be use for bad use such as students using for games and apps, texting etc ,

I believe cellphones could drop grades. i've been through it all and seen it all, im a student myself and sometimes when our teachers allowes us to use our cellphones i take the chance to look through my texts and i would see my classmates do the same, but then we have moments where we reallly need to serach up information or our teacher would love to play an online game then its really useful .

There cant be a right or wrong answer to this but there could be an amazing arugment to this issue.

FFE16D704B16,"Many people disagree with Albert Schweitzer's quote, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" They think that he meant that it doesn't matter who did it, that the thing that matters is the example. In my case, Albert Schweitzer was right on his quote. Although many people say that there are better ways to influence others than just with your own experience because there are famous people with more interesting examples, actually the best way to influence others is setting a good example on your own behavior because it shows that you were capable of doing it no matter how hard it was for you and yet you still did it and also you will inspire other people to do their own example based on your ideas.

Some people say that there are better ways to influence others because than with your own experience because there are famous people with more interesting examples. Meaning that you have to be someone important in order to influence others. They say that intelligence is another way to influence others because if you're not smart you won't make a good example for others to follow. In conclusion they say that you have to be a skilled and important person to have a huge influence on others.

Actually, the best way to influence other is not being someone important in society but setting a good example on your own behavior. It will show that that even though it was hard for you to do your example, in the end you still did it. That show that no matter who you are or where you come from as long as you have determination you will achieve your goals. Look at Barack Obama for example, he's a black man and yet he still managed to become president of the United States. That really had a huge impact in the black community and inspired many of them to work hard for their goals.

Also, you will inspire other people based on your own ideas. An article on New York Times shows that most of the people based their ideas on other people's examples, which means that if you continue working hard to achieve your goals you will appear on one of those articles and will inspire others. Think about it, wouldn't you like to hear that one person gave you credits because became successful because he read about your experience and he based his ideas on that experience of yours?

In conclusion, many people will say that in order to influence others you need to become somebody important, but you know what? That doesn't matter! As long as you have determination and great creativity you will achieve your goals and will inspire many people to follow their dreams no matter how much it will cost them. Like Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" It doesn't matter what people say, the one that has the power to inspire others is you!
