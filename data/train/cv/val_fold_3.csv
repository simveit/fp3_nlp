004AC288D833,"Dear Principal,

Our school should have a community center. The reasons why, are so students can learn what our community needs, how to make our community better place, and why is community important for students to know. Its a great to have a community center to know how we can make things better.

Students think community center takes their time away. but they have to learn what our community needs. students will participate in a group of students making a list what our community needs, therefore students will learn what our community needs! students will present their list of things our community needs! due to that students will be giving extra credit for the ones who have low grades!

Some students don't participate because their friends say its waste of time. it would not be waste of time when you get to know how our community can be a better place for us. students should know that the program is about our own lives, because if our community is bad well our lives are going to be bad. due to that students will want to participate and will want to make our community a better place for us.

some student might say why is the community important anyways, were fine nothing is wrong. but when get to know what our community is, they would want to know about and would want to participate and know why is our community important. students will receive a good grade if they participate in this community because is like an extra credit. due to that their friends would want to enjoy the program because their friend told them about it.

so principal the community center will be a great place for students to learn lots of things. so i guess this will be a good idea for our school. students will learn what our community needs, how to make our community a better place, and why is our community important!

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME",3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0
00B21F9B726F,"Do you think its a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? In some societies, students are expected to identity a career by the time they enter high school. Yes it is a good idea to start young because your already step ahead, you will have background knowledge about the career classes you choose and once you get older you won't have time to choose an career. Also taking courses in high school will help you choose your career like for an example academy classes.

As a students taking a career course, will help them learn more about that career and you will have background knowledge about that career. for an example I'm taking auto technology in highschol becuase I want to learn more about cars and how to fix them. after high school I will be going to a community college so I can learn an advance auto technology class and move on and thats I'm going to succeed in life.

Another reason why its a good idea for students to commit to a career at young age is becuase it will help students choose a good career that pays good money and the students will be a one step ahead. by doing this they will accomplish their goals.

others may say that its not a good idea for students to commit a career at a young age becuase they think its waste of time however, its not waste of their time, becuase once your getting older you wont have time to choose an career that will last.

In conclusion, I think its a good a idea for students to commit to a career at a young age becuase you will have some background knowledge to that specific career, you will be one step ahead, and once you get older you won't have time to choose a career.

011AAA636F11,"Have you ever solved a math problem in less than 30 seconds? Math is important to many people. Even president Trump uses math to buy food or pay back to important people. He might be paying people to find a cure for the Coronavirus. However did you know that we use math every single day in our life?

How do people use math every single day you may ask. When you go to the super market to buy food, the register has to add all the food that you bought and they even have to add taxes. How about when you go shopping in the mall with some friends. When some is looking for a job they even have to find out how much is the salary. When your parents pay water bills and taxes, they have to pay the perfect amount of money. If your doing a party you have to find how much money your wasting. In your school you have to use math in mostly all your subject. In science you have find out how much of a mass is in a cup of water then subtract it from the cup to find the mass of water. For history the president has to find out about expensive's and the taxes that each citizens is paying. If you have a hobby or have talents to do an activity you even use math. In theater arts you have to measure and subtract where the lights are hitting and you have to find the perfect angel. In baking you have to add your ingredients and weight it to find it's mass.

When you cook don't tell me you just put random stuff in your pot. You have to find the perfect amount to feed the people you are feeding. In soccer you have to find the angle you are going to kick the soccer ball. Basketball is the same, you have to see from which angel you are going to throw the ball to make a point for your team. Here are some school activity's that you use math in your school.

However several kid's don't like math but they could try it in a fun way. Many children complain about math being to hard or just being boring. I have found a way to make it exciting for kids. They could be playing games or just pretending to buy stuff, like doing a little play that won't cost money. If a student likes painting give them a coloring book that has math in it. Dancing and music is the same thing like coloring. In music you can count how many strings a violin has and compare it to another instrument that is in the violin family. You can watch a funny video that is related to math, you can watch it in your home or in school. Go on a field trip that will be free or that won't cost that much money.

If a student is struggling in math help or show them a way to do it. A kid's classmates or friend could help them in math. They can use math websites like racing cars for boys and coloring games for girls. If they are still struggling then ask there parents if they can stay or to get them a tutor after school. Find them a easier and understandable way to teach them math. The child's teacher can even play fun games with her students like Kahoot,Quizlet live, or even Pear Deck. You can give out prizes like candy or sticker's, that will probably get them more exciting.

Many scientist say that math is helpful to your brain and makes it healthy for you and your brain. You will acknowledge many ways to solve several math problems from years to years until you graduate from collage or high school. The reason why I choose to do my lesson about math is that I want kids to be independent and to get responsible when they grow up to be adults. ",4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0

Becuse if I did something bad,

I can not tell other person is you fall,

I can not live with fear did somethin wrong, becuse we can learned own mistake, and future can be a better person.

I think that If you have a positive attitude you wont get in trouble because the attitude that you give out is the way that people judge you, A positive attitude is a great way to get the things you want in life like for example, If you want to get a job or a career you have to have a good and positive attitude because if not then they will not accept you like for another example if you have a positive attitude you can make friends and people will like you because of the way you are if your kind people will be like ""wow this person is so nice and kind"" i just think that being kind and nice is the best way to be in life you dont really get in trouble because your attitudes nice and not rude and about things that people tell you or want you to do in the other hand if your rude and people people will look and you and think about you in a rude way and not like you. The reasons I feel like a positive attitude is good because i am a kind person and dont get in to trouble with none because there is no reason to be mad and angry about small stuff. I fell like other people might think different about what I think because we all think different about everything. If you go to a friends house and you be all mean and rude and all dirty people are not going to like you because of the way you are and the other hand if you are all nice people they will like you because of how you are you and that you have respect of how your attitude is if not then you will not be wanted by people because of you act and are and people who act all rude end up in places they never thought they would end up in i just saying just stay with a positive attitude in the world and you will succeed in life and be great and not have to go through stuff like get in to fights or locked up in jail. I meant i know some people that have bad attitude and life and they are doing great in life but there is going to be one day that you will get in a problem by the way you act i think that just stay with a positive attitude so you dont got to worry about anythings and that its just better way to get al the things you need and would like to active in life because why be all rude when you can just be sweet and caring then be all grumpy and mad about small little things that can be fixed because thats what I think but if you have a bad attitude you might like end up saying or doing something that you will regret like if your like taking and with a attitude you might end up saying stuff that you dont mean and if your normal and calm about stuff you dont go to worry about nothing. I also been told that if your have a great attitude you wont have to worry about stuff because why would someone care about how you are if your all nice and not rude.",2.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5
04B3A4DD9460,"I agree that talking to guidence is a good idea because guidence can help people on what is good or bad things to do in life. same people can even talk to guidence about thier problems and tell them what can be best can be a good solution for thier problems or for what they are passing throw in life too, However not that many people like to talk to guidence about thier problems people prefer to stay silence about their issues.

Eventhough some may say that people should not talk to guidence because guidence does not help in anything. guidance is the best resorce person to go to because they help you to stay focoues in problems you go throw in life.

Let say for example if you need help in school problems with family's or someone dies that was really close to you guidance could help you with depresion problems, familiy problems they are councelers but just few changes,

guidance can help you with paper work that you don't understand and fill in the paper work. Guidance is a good idea because guidence can help people on many stuff and find sulution of it one way to another. Guidance is the act of process of guiding, it also has counseling such as that provided for students about vocational and eduaction matters, Any of variovs processes of guiding a vericle by means of biltin equipment.

Guidance is someone who guides to the right way, or someone to look up too. gauidance is a good solution to problems and festration when a person does not have no one to talk to and they could have trust on guidance. where could people find guidance well guidance are in school or out of school too. Guidance help kids with school and fouces more on school and talk to parents, on how to maintan a kid focues in school and home.

Guidance helps kids to love and keep parents involved with them more and show them how to pertect thier kids.

04B6FD84A066,"Aiming for small goals and accomplishing them are pointless. although, it is not a bad idea to make small goals and achieve them however, aiming for a bigger achievement will help in the long run. Achievements that are harder or much bigger can teach you a lot during the process of failure. In my opinion failing at long term goals is more beneficial then achieving small goals.

One reason why failing at long term goals is better then to achieve a small goal is that you keep learning when you fail it is a part of life that you need in order to have success. For example, You might never succeed or progress in something you havent failed at, failure helps you learn to do better and not make the same mistakes. Achieving small goals is not a bad idea but to fail while trying to go your hardest is better because that is your full potential and it helps in your future. Aiming for easier goals does not help learn about failure and you need failure to be successful and experienced.

Having long term goals is the better way to go. For instance, you can have a goal that can go on for a couple years and when you accomplish it it will feel way better than something you didnt fail or get tired on. Long term goals also help you plan ahead and really perfect your craft or perfect what you are trying to accomplish. Having a goal that you can easily achieve does not help you with learning because you dont fail and it does not take tie and experience. For example, a goal is something you have to push to achieve, so if you dont have to fail and learn it is not a realistic goal.

Accomplishing and working on something you know you can achieve is not really success. Goals are achievements that are supposed to benefit you. For example, if my goal was to learn how to swing a bat it wouldnt be better than my goal wanting to win the world series. small achievements come with big goals you can learn how to swing a bat while you are training for the world series. Aiming bigger will help you accomplish more then just your goal . It will also teach you skills like patience and practice and that you will accomplish small goals on the road to the big goal.

As you can see, I agree with what Michelangelo said about aiming low and accomplishing your goal because when you aim low you dont really have a challenge or real goal. You dont get to experience failure and having to do so much to reach the goal. Aiming higher and failing is when you put your effort and you fail but when you learn from that failure and keep trying to achieve the goal in different ways you will achieve it as well as other small goals along the way.",4.5,4.0,5.0,4.5,4.0,4.0

I learned it in different sitution from expericing with my friends like some they change there belives and some have different life style of living some parents disaprove of them the way of living and some are disapointing what they choose to do in life.

05CE0C0C5102,"Is it a good idea for student to finish high school in three years? Well I think that if student take three years to high school is that they know what they want to do in their life. Those student either want to go to college early, go the the work force, or start something from their passion. I am going to talk about three things of what I think about this prompt. Those things are students knowing they want to do in their lives, student not knowing what to do in their lives, or student just want to be done with school.

Student that take a three year high school plan, know what to do after those three years are up. They are determine to finish high school so they can finally start learning something that they have wanted to do. In those three years student are willing to finish any assignments on time and will at least get A's on their grades. They use their time wisely and always focus something to get it done. Once those are out of their way they are ready for the next step in their life.

Most students take a four year high school because they want to take time of what they want to do in their lives. The reason is, is that students just do not know what they want to do. Students just do not know what interest them so they have a hard time of their whole life. Some students just know what they want to do, but do not want to take a three year high school because it can be to stressful for them. most student will finish high school and can continue to college wandering what to do.

If a student ether take a three or a four year high school maybe just want to be done with school in general. those students may just think that college maybe just not worth the time, some just dont have the money to pursuing college. Those student may just know what to do and know that college is just not needed for that and is just a waste of time. They could have the resources already to pursuit the things that they want to do and so they are prepared for what is coming.

To put it all together, make sure choose what is best for you wither it is a three year high school plan, or a four year high school plan. In those years student have got to prepare for them selves if they are taking a three year there is going to be a lot of work being done so they can graduate early. For the students who are taking a four years for high school got to use their time wisely and think about what they want to do during those years. I feel like what is the best option is a four years of high school because i dont want to do a lot of work in three years. so that is what i think about this prompt, four years of high school is good enough for me.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0
061AF57CB05C,"John Lubbock wrote ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" When it comes down to it though I think our own character traits are formed by influences around us. I say this because even if we can say what we are, the things around us can change that for the better or the worse. What can change us can be the people around us, the things around us, and even the friends we make. A other thing that can influence us is our family since DNA can give us some of our parents personally and the way they treat us can change our personally as well. Now other people who say we can chose have their own opinion as well. They think we can choose our own character traits. They say this because once you put your in mind on it you'll be able keep it like that. I also thought this as well but that change because my family and friends were totally different they what I was going for and thats how I became what I did. They also think it would be worse to let pick on its own since it would be unhealthy. This is understandable because it would mean thinking less about it but I think it be more helpful since being around people who are kind and helpful can and will rub off on you.

I will explain how they develop when they have a homework club,and my personal experience.

Student will highly improve when they are in an After school homework club because student will comprehend even better while they are doing there homework with people that can help them. In my belief this is a good way to help kids not just with there homework but kids will improve on uderstading skills. they will learn how to learn things in a different way if they do not understand. Student will pass more tests and have better chances of getting to college and take this world in a good direction. I truly believe that helping kids with school work is the base for them selves and this world.

Kids from k-12 will develop as they go . They can develop even better when they have help around them. Kids are bright and smart they have fresh minds and they can hold things in there minds. If kids can have the 100% help they will just be absolutely geniuses they will be better than the person that thought them. If kids can have academic growth

10% a year with out help imagine what they could do if they had a homework club where like I said where they can be talented.

when I was in 5th grade, I was kid that loved math but I was not very good at it. So my teacher suggested for me to join the homework club after school. At first I was not happy about it but then once I started to go I loved it because

I understood math even better I kept geting in the upper 90 with test scores ,I had the most lessons done on a math program that is called Think trough math. I became a student helper at the homework club and I am now a smart intelligent math student.

when I get to high school I will volunteer at the homework clubs at and go help kids for my own good and because I love to help people.

These are all the reasons why I believe that having an after school homework club is important to students improvements. I will continue to volunteer in helping kids academically . Like we all know youth is the future of this world. I truly believe there are so many kids out there in the world that need help and they are smart but they can not get it because there is no one that pays attention to it. There will changes to that may be not in my life time but I will do what ever I can to get kids from around the world education and help where they can develop and be the best they can be.

07F3241EB3C6,""" How would pairing older students with younger students in school be helpful for both older and younger students?""

When I was in elementary school in Zambia I skipped 4th grade and went in 5th grade and it was challenging for me to keep up with the work in 5th grade. I was used to doing the same work as the other 4th graders in my school however things changed when I skipped 4th grade to 5th grade. When I got in 5th grade I started doing harder work than I did in 4th grade, I started getting lower grades than I did in 4th grade. When I was in 5th grade (where there were older people than me) I had to work hard to be at the same level as the other 5th graders. This was like taking college classes in high school. Pairing older students with younger students in school will help both the older and younger students because the younger students will be able to learn from the older students, the older students will learn how be good examples for the younger students, and the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learning and become good examples when they grow up.

When younger students are paired with older students, the younger students will be able to learn from the older students. Generally speaking kids are most likely to follow what older people are doing. In this case if older students are paired with younger students the younger students will learn good manners from the older students. Younger students will learn many things from the older students such as: good behavior, hard work, kindness, and etc... When I'm sitting around elder at home I learn a lot about different countries and cultures in the world. For instance, when the elders are talking about what is happening in Congo - a country in Africa - I learn about the economy in Congo and its government. It is just like learning in my Civics class at school. This is beneficial for me because I get learn and share about is going in some other places with my Civics teacher.

When older students are paired with younger student, the older students will learn how to be good examples for the younger students. Being a good example for younger kids is best for what the will do and be in the future hence, it is why my parents tell me to be the good example for my younger my younger brothers by being well behaved and respectful so that my younger bothers will learn from my behavior. My AVID teacher told me that when his son was young he taught him that boots were bananas and bananas were boots therefor his son knew that boot were bananas and bananas were boots. According to what AVID teacher told me in the pasted sentence it shows that kids do what elders do. It is really important for older people to be good examples for the younger ones.

When older students are paired with younger students, the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learn in school and become good examples when they grow up. Additionally when older students are paired with younger students it will encourage the your students to work hard and on the same level as the older students. I have a friend who skipped 7th grade at my school. When I asked her how she was doing in 8th grade, she said at first it was really hard for her to maintain her grades. But she encouraged herself to work hard and get good grades. She had to study every night and on the other hand she had work to do at home. It became challenging for her to keep up with both school work and work she did at home. Ultimately from all her hard work she got a scholarship for college while in middle school.

Pairing older kids with younger kids in school is helpful for both the older students and the younger students because the younger students will be able to learn from the older students, the older students will learn how to be good examples for the younger students, and the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learning in school and become good examples for others when they grow up. How would your life be like being in a place where there are no elderly people to learn from? We should always be good examples for younger people so that they can learn from us.

Other may think that examples are not the main thing in influencing other. Because there are many others way by influencing others. Others don't want to share what happens in their life for examples.

The best way to show other people is to give them one example about your own experience. There are many other ways but example is more important. You let other people know something that you have learn it. For example, My parents are taking about them self last night their was taking about how can I influence my family in the future. They said, that the is a best way to influence them is through examples in my own experience.

What you learned from that examples in your life. Give other examples from what you learn in your own life would be a good way to influence that people. There are many people that are passing about what you had passing through. For example,Angie my best friend is in drugs and I don't want that she happens what happen to me. So, I give her a example about my experience in drugs that what happens to me is going to happen with her if she continue to consuming drugs.

In conclusion, Example is the main thing to influence other because the best way is through examples. You learn from the example in your life. Many people need to know our experience to know what are they doing. people want to know the consequences of what is going to happen to them based on our experience.",3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5

Well,I think students can be benefit this program,if they can work at home by the way of online or video conferencing,because students have more opotuniry to study like have more time to work,they don't need to walk or take a bus to come school,can be more effect to students,students can feel better when they try to stury because in his home there is not people talking a lot abuot things,but people talking not about the class.

Also student can choose the time to they can star the classes,because some students have to work in a job,so when is cold outside and students they don't like to come school,they can wort at home by the way of online or video conferencing,students can be more responseble or maybe not is depent what class of student are you,but the things is there is a lot reasons of benefit for stundents can have that classes.

Some students feel good working at home,there is not streess for them,they can take a break,they can eat and his work. They spend more the energy of his mind etc...

I think the best option for students to attend classes from home by the way of online or video coferencing to learn. But also is depent waht classes student do you are,because some student are lazy when they work at home.

Also parent can check his work in look if they do his work good or bad,take classes online is one think like because for me is more aesy to do my homework,so inconclution students have benefit from being able to attend classes from home. ",2.5,2.0,2.5,1.5,2.5,2.0
0A1482CD6163,"I agree that "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" (Duke Ellington) because I believe that this statement means that even if there is a problem there is a chance for you to improve next time.

One reason why I agree with this statement is because you can improve for next time. For example, let's say you are having difficulty with one of the subjects you're learning at school and you have an assignment due the next day. So you try your hardest on this assignment but when you turn it in the next day you score a low grade,and you go ask your teacher if you can make up that assignment but they say no. Now in this situation the student can learn for this and take this as a chance to improve for next time.

Another reason why I agree with this statement is because something unexpected might come out of that problem. One way is that let's say you are doing a group project for on of your classes and there's a few people in your group that aren't contributing to the group. So you decide to try your best to take the lead of this project and try to get everyone to express their ideas. This shows how a group of student go through a problem with people not wanting to participate but then the student decides to take the lead of the project and try to include everyone.

My last reason why I agree with this statement is because you can do your best on something. One way you can improve the way other view you is by trying your best to solve that problem. For example, if you are having trouble with something then you can try to ask people you know are a teacher for help. This is so you can find the best solution to your problem and do your best.

In conclusion, I agree that "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" (Duke Ellington).

0AAD73A0AA91,"I think working in a group is more efficiently and helpful then working alone. In these paper i will argue about the benefice of working in a group. Working in group is better because we can share ideas, prepare us for the real world, and save time.

If we work in groups, we can share information, ideas and thoughts. We can see what its better for our teamwork and the assignment that we were doing in school or jobs. I think the most of the jobs in the real world are in groups, however, when i work in the mechanic shop with my dad and brothers, an i'm replacing a engine, i need their help because it takes strange, agility and experience to replaced it, because it's really hard for only one person to do it, so it's important to learn how to work in group, these skills prepare and help us for the real world by working like a team or family group. The army, police officer and government are some good examples of groups, they work together to finish their work and see the benefices of working in group. Doing work as a team is not a waste of time, we share the responsibilities,so it would not be the much work for only one person. Two or more people is a good combination of beneficial and fast work.

some say that working alone is better then working in group, but they wrong because when we work in groups is more easy by sharing thought with friend and partners, we get to now each other and makes new friends, that is the way how people get better in life by working in groups. Working in groups make people to put more effort and attention in what they are doing because we want to get better opportunities in life, good greats and chances of getting a great job.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0
0AFAD06336F3,"Attending classes from home is not a good idea. I think it's better to attend classes at school for many reasons that I have experienced at home. It's not fun becuase you don't have any teacher to explain to you what you don't understand (well you will have a teacher but he or she wont be there personally), you won't get any help from no one if your taking the online course. Also student will not benefit it because they will be off track and instead of doing there work or what they are suppose to be doing, they will be wondering around by the internet. I defenitly do not agree that the student will benefit attending classes at home.

Having a tecaher with you in class is wonderful. There will be a point when you will have so many questions about the topic that you were discussing with the class. When your in class at school you will learn so much from teachers by giving out examples that are being giving out to the class and explaining it to you. But if your taking an online course It's defenitly more difficult for you to understand the main idea of the lesson. We won't have a teacher right next to us. We have to work indepentdently with out a friends help. It's not similar to when your in class and you ask a friend for help, they will love to help you out. Online class you won't have a friend helping you out. We have to take so many notes in order to understand the objective of the lesson. I personally had so much trouble with the online class, I had to take about 3-5 lessons each day, I had to write down notes for each lesson, I had to take at least five quizzes each day. I had to re-read the lesson like threes time in order to understand and capture the important facts. Honestly you learn how to be more organize and independent each day. I personally consider students to attend classes at school. It's not a good idea doing online class and taking so many notes.

In class, tecahers are strict when student have there electonic out whil there tecaheing or when student are working on class work. At home and doing your class work and at the same time being on your phone, your not paying fully interest on your class, Since you home, don't have a teacher, you feel like you have the right to be on your phone and laptop and do what ever you want, and not doing you work. That shouldn't be the case if you stay home and take the online class, It's because to there was a purpose. If we don't pay attention to what we are doing, and we are paying more attention to our phones we will never learn anything abiut the course. That could cause use to fail the class. Than, we got to re-teake the class.

In my opinion I will also agree to some student that wants to take the online class because you can wake up late, taking you time to eat breakfast. It's not like going to school having to get up so early, not having the time to eat, and having to chase the school bus. I'm that type of person that loves to sleep. But it's our responsibilty to do our work and tun it on time before the deadline. If you dont want to fail the class you have to save some time for your class than, you have to save some time for your self and for school work. Not all the time it will be about you. There needs to be some time for something else more important.

In conclusion, I think Student will not benefit from able to attend classes at home. It's a lot of responsibility to remind your self that have to attend class at home, do all your work and turn it in on time. We wont have a teacher with us (personally), we have to do all our work independently. That's why I think it's not a good idea for students to attend classes at home.                                      ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0

What does he mean by "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best.""? A problem is a mistake you did, and doing your best is improving form your mistakes. Some people learn from their mistake, and others don't. People who do learn from their mistake can help others and their self.

I do agree that problems is a chance for all of us to do are best. Their some people who don't really care if it happens again. We should all care about our mistakes because if we didn't care our mistakes would happen again , and if that mistake was bad, then you should care.

I made lots of mistake like failing a grade because i didn't care about school , but then i change and stared to be more motivated and now that helps me work hard to get my dream job.

I needed help so i asked a friend. They told me some advices but i was still confused so i decide to ask another friend. If the advices were not helping out so much then i would just ask the teacher and the teacher should give you a lot of helpful advices because there the ones that are teaching the class so they should know what to do to help a student out.

Also the reason why people ask multiple persons for advice is because. if you ask one person for advice that person may not give you a lot of advices than asking multiple people for advices because the advices that other people are giving you can help you out more than that one advice that the one person gave you.

Asking multiple people for advice can teach you new things that you didnt know of. Asking multiple people for advice can help you in so many ways. Asking multiple people for advice make you help someone one day that needs advices in problems.

I feel like asking multiple people for advice can be important to you in so many ways like doing your homework, doing school work, driving a car, taking care of a baby, and so many other stuff that could help you in life for asking multiple people for advices.            ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5
0BEB8F7F5A64,"First impression are very important when you first meet someone. Many people say first impressions are almost impossible to change, but i strongly disagree with that. Majority of the time when we meet someone we already think of them in a certain way, but our judgment could always be wrong. Thats why i believe first impressions could always change.

I believe that first impressions can change the way people think of you. Sometimes people can be irritable or just in a really bad mood because something is occurring in their lives, but in reality that's not how they really are. One reason first impressions can be wrong, is because maybe they didn't get enough sleep at night, and they have to get up early to go to work, or school in the morning. For example, i am not much of a morning person, so when i wake up in the mornings i can be rude, and people might not want to talk to me, but if you see me later in the afternoon i will be smiling, and laughing. Another reason first impressions could be wrong, is because they might not feel comfortable with the people who they are surrounded by, and be very shy, but once you start talking to them they change. For example, my best friend and i used to hate each other. I used to think she was annoying, and rude, and i am guessing she thought the same for me. One day we both started to talk to each other, and i found out we have many things in common, and that we are like the same people. That same day we became the best of friends, now we are basically like sisters. This is why i think that first impressions can always change.

Schools should extend time by two hours because students will have more time to do there class work. If a students have more time to do there class work then they will not have there class work as homework. Having more time in school means that you can get your work done and have extra time to do othere class work. In my old school we only had seven hours of school and we have eight classes in a day. most of the time we barley had time to finish ower class work so we had to finish it as homework. We also did not have time to do labs, expirement, and project. Thats why having more time can help us do all of those things. Another reason would be is that teachers will have time to explane to students things that they do not get. Teachers have time to explane things to a students and help them under stand more about what they are learning. In the movie Matilda students there only had six hours of school and teacheres did not have time to explane things to students. Students only went to school, tooke notes, and went back home. Sense they had no time at school to do class work they had a lot of homework. Most of them did not even finish there home work becauses it was to much. At the end of the movei students had took an exam and they had the whole six hours to finish it. When the time was up ninde persont of the students did not finished so they automaticly failed. if only they just had more time, more students would have passed the exam. Another reason would be that having more time can help students is that scientists prove that having more time added in a school schedual will help students incress there acidemic by ten persont. That means if i spend more time in school learning i will be come smarter then students with a regular schedual.

0E26C20CFBBE,"Imagine being asked to teach a lesson but actually teaching it to elementary students. It would be a very helpful for the students that are struggling. I conquer with the person that is going to go and share the lesson. I am going to give you specific details and examples about the things I would do if I was he or she going to share the lesson with elementary students and why it should be important.

One way that I agree by sharing a lesson to other students is important. This can be more helpful because the other teacher before that taught the students maybe didn't explain very well and the students were probably were confused the whole time or some of them were lackadaisical. And the new teacher that is going to teach the lesson to the students probably is a better explained and a probably has good and more skills. He or she maybe been called from many different schools and different states and asking if he or she can go teach a lesson to their students but if the teacher agrees with it.

Another way I could be more helpful for the students by asking their teacher if I can see the whole students grades that are in the class and the people that are struggling and make a group lesson with them. The teacher should tell the students to write down notes when the teacher is writing them down too. The teacher should give the students homework and tell them to bring it back and check it and see if they have gotten better with the way the teacher is helping them more or not. The teacher should give a form to the students parents for the ones that are struggling and asking them permission if they want the teacher to help them more in what they are struggling more in. So the students can get their grade up and better in the SOL's.

My last thing that I would do to be more specific and very useful is to give the students tests of the things they have been struggling with and see if they have gotten more better and see if the teacher has done a good job to the students. The teacher should give meetings to the student teachers and more lessons so they don't need to call for a better teacher than them. And its better if the teachers can get taught so they can be more specific in what the students asks them. All the teachers of the elementary should all go take lessons to teach better and get quizzed like their students.

I explained why it is important to share a lesson to other students. Some of the students got better and some didn't but at least they tried and put effort in it. All my reasons should help why a teacher should share a lesson with other students. The students should be more grateful for the teacher that came and helped them out.

I disagree with that because our character formed by influences beyond our control, for example we all leaned whats right or wrong, let's take a babies for example the leaned for people all around them, by seeing what they do for example how they speak, how they walk and how they dress. the only they can not be influences by other people if their parent stop then from doing all those things. take me for example as a baby grow up speaking french because thats that the Language. when I moves to my grandma place she speak Spanish with me so now I speak Spanish, and french I could never speak those languages if I was not influence by those around me.

I get the part that said we choose our own character trait because we all now if something worn or not we can choose to the wrong thing or the right thing it up to us at this point for example some ask you what you what to be in the future now it you choose to make even tho you have a choose there is a 50/50 present you will follow the same path as some in your life that influences you. we all are influences by something or someone an example some teen want to be raper because there is someone around their that one or they want to be a basketball player because the know a basketball player they think he or she is cool. if you disagree with me, ask yourself, how did I become who I'm today?

Another example: Once we decide what our goal is we maintain our mind occupied in our goal and work hard to get there, or to accomplish that we really want, and not matter how hard it is we can do it. because it what we want to be, is what we like, and also is to get a good future and a good life, like if we get a good job we can get good money and we don't have to worried about that and just enjoy life and try to work hard everyday.

Another reason that why I think we have to maintain our self doing something we like. is because we can get trouble to accomplish want we want. like we can do drugs and drink alcohol and all that kind of stuff and I think that is bad for our life because that interrupt our way and we get distracted and loss our path and our faith for our self because for just one mistake we can loss all the think that we had worked for. and I think we have to focus if we really what to be a professional person of if we want to be someone in the future.

In the other hand other people think that inactivity also serve a purpose like we can live our life no matter if we do something, or not like if we don't work hard for our goals its fine, and some people say that what happen in your life is for a reason or like is your destiny. but i think that they are wrong because we can decide what we going to be in our life, that's why God left us the free will to have the opportunity to choose what we going to fight for, and make a decision that going to help us to accomplish whatever we want in this life.

In conclusion I believe that we can accomplish many awesome and great things if we work hard for our goals and maintain our mind doing something good and something that we love like in our jobs, our school, our career etc. also if we maintain our mind occupied in something productive at the same we win something because its help our life and also we have to be careful to don't get distracted for others bad things like drugs, alcohol etc.

I believe we have to take care to our life like a treasure because this life is what God give us and we have to be careful the decision we take and if we get wrong we can learn from our mistake, and I think is wonderful how much may be done if we are doing something that we like.

10D3A9E5E79E,"Whlie some people say that doing something that you mastered help you achive your goals, others say that you should try something more challenging to achive more than your goals.

Achiving more than yhour goals can get you farther in life, it can make your job or what you like to do exciting, and your education expands.

If you think you cannot do it, you are not beliving in yourself.

In order to achive your goals and be happy, you have to belive in yourself first.

Put yourself to do more than what you expected.

Being successful meaning get further in life, have to do with the majority of the world, what's around you, and what you put yourself to do.

In my opinion,

getting further in life is great, not so many people have the privilages to do what you can.

A student once challenged herself by taking chemistry.

At first she did not believe that she can do it but hen she ended up passing the class.

Do not expect less from what you deserve.

Some people do not like their job, so they do a really crappy job.

Making your job exciting is great but, how can you make it fun?

First find something that you like.

Then make a challage every week to be successful, keep in mind that is for the better. Think about it like a game.

Everyone likes games meaning that they would like a challege.

Education has been a big part of ours lives and will always be.

A person can learn from just watching a person characteristics.

There is planty ways a person can learn.

Be ready for any occasion that happens, mentally ready, emotional ready, and even physically ready.

Life is full of surprises and will teach us good and bad things through out the times.

Just be your best and learn from every little thing that happen and will happen.

In conclusion Emerson is right, ""do something beyond what you already mastered.""

Meaning that you should challage yourself and achive more than your actual goals.

Believe in yourself and be better each day.

In this world everything is like a game but, is to make you better.     ",3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5
10DA9316D02D,"This program helps students to learn new things,helps older students to mature of teaching and taking it seriously,and helps younger students to socialize with new people and to communicate,and prepares the older students to prepare lessons and teach and be more organized,it can also help older and younger students to learn new different skills and learn different ways.

The first best thing about having programs for younger and older students is for the younger students can learn new things. I think it's best to teach young people to learn new things because it can prepare them in the future. I think that the program can help the younger students for they can learn interesting new things and for they can decide what they want to be in the future. If the younger students get help from the older students to learn new things it's good because for they can use that information and teach other kids what they have learn from the older students. I think this program can help many other young students to learn new things from the older students because it's a better way for the students for can use what they have learn and use it for something for their future life like for example math they can use that for paying taxes and bills I think that this program can help students learn new things.

The second, thing that is good about this program,is the older kids can mature from teaching younger students and learn how to be more thinkable about what to teach and how to teach something. I think that this program is good because the older student learn how to focus more on what they are able to teach the younger students. The reason why I think the program is a good learning resource is because when the older students know more things than the younger students they can decide what do they need help on learning what should I teach them and how do I teach the subject to them so it makes the older students more focus to how to know how teach a younger students and the best way to help them. It helps older students because they can think in a better way and to make them feel more grown up teaching someone that is younger than them. This program helps older students because it makes them think more harder and it also teaches the older students how to think more ideas and thin what happens if they teach that, or well this lesson help them, and makes them ask questions to themselves.

The third reason, how this program can help younger students, is because the younger students can communicate more to new people they don't know. I think that this program helps younger students to communicate more is because if they talk to more new people that are helping them they well be less shy and it well make it less difficult for them to be shy to talking to someone new. I think that this program helps younger student to learn better to communicate is because they can get more confidence, and not be scared to talk in front of someone new and different. I think that this program dose help younger students with communication because when they talk to someone new they can feel more comfortable talking to more people and be more social. This program helps younger people to communicate because when they talk to someone it can help them to be less scared to like present projects and talk to a crowd.

The fourth reason, why this program helps older students to prepare for lessons and be like a more organized,thinkable person. I think that this program dose help older students be more organized is because they think what they are gonna teach them and what the younger students are struggling on. I think that this program dose help a lot of certain older students be organized because they think what time,and day,where they are gonna teach the lessons to the younger students. I think that this program dose really help the older students to be organized cause it makes them more prepare what they are gonna teach and how they are gonna teach it so basically, the older students think were to put what. Why I think that this program dose help older students to be more organized because they plan everything in order.

I think this program dose help both young and older students because if they all work together and help each other it can make a difference on helping and making people learn in a way certain way an easier way. I think that this program dose help younger and older students cause they can both share their learning skills how they learn things and shares ideas. I think this program helps because all the younger students and older students teach each other things and help them get better at something they are having trouble at doing. I think this program dose help cause it helps every students to learn a easy way to learn in different ways like flashcards,reading something over and over again,watching turturiols videos on how to do a equation or math so this program helps to find the best skill for you. It helps for all the students for they can learn faster and easier and help others find their best learning skill to focus on what they are learning.

It helps both older students and younger students to improve there learning skills and it's a good program to learn new interesting things to help students for the future.    ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0

At night is really beautiful if you live in a apartment you can see how beautiful it is when i'm bigger i'm going to Generic_City with my girl because I love that country and it's a awesome country. The food there is really good and at night you can go in the water with someone it's really fun.

The boats are big and small you can ride them and you can relax. I don;t know how much you have to play to ride them all I know is that they are really nice to ride.

1202062A4FA5,"Just like some businesses schools should adopted a four day school week with each day consisting of ten hours by making the school day two hours longer. To conserve energy and resources some businesses have adapted a four day work week with each day consisting of ten hours. Should this school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? After considering the benefits and disadvantages to a four day school week. Some believe that changing the school week to only four days is a bad idea because less school days means most work is not done and students will have extra time they don't need. Other people think a four day school week is an effective way of conserving students energy while keeping the same passe. People are still arguing about this issue. Schools should adopted a four day work week because students will be productive, It is healthy especially for students that work and have time for family and friends.

Four days of school week help students to be productive. To be productive you need two things energy and motivation. Most students have the motivation to work but they lake the energy therefor they need four day school week. By extending the school day two hours we can achieve the same amount of work by working only four days. For example one school day is consists of for classes and one class is one hour and forty five minuet long. When we extend the school day two hours long for four days it covers the same time. That helps us to use own time efficiently and increase productivity in the school.

Learning four days week also help students to be healthy specially for those who work on the regular days or weekends. People need enough amount of energy to get through the day without fatigue. The only natural and healthy way of get ride of fatigue is sleep. Many scientific studies says ""Kids and Teenagers need at list 9 hours of sleep!"" having four day of school day a week gives students one extra day of rest. It makes a big different and very important for students health.

The final reason we need a four day school week day is to give students time with there parents and friends. parents and students want to spent quality time together but they are not able to because some parents work on the weekends or the students work on weekends. Four days school week is the best solution to this problem. It gives students the attention that they need form there parents and spend some time with there friends.

If we can change the old school system by this new and effective four day school week days It will be beneficial in many ways not just for students but for teachers and parents. Students will be productive, health and they will have more time to spent with there family and friends.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5

12920189F7BB,"Some societies may think that students are expected to identify a career by the time they reach high school. High school students shouldn't rush their selves to think about the career they want to accomplish. Most importantly they should stay focused on what's important which is education. Students have more than enough time to think about their careers, but not at this moment. They're too young to understand the reality that they're going to face, and the struggle that they're not expecting to happen. Which is why it's really important for them to stay focused on their education, than to suffer later in their lives.

To be honest, nothings wrong with thinking about your career, but it's not always healthy to think or stress about it all the time. Because it could cause an affection on your mind which isn't good. For students who first enter high school, should think more importantly about their grades and how well they're doing in school. At a young age students are fed in with so many ideas and careers that they want to accomplish in life. Their minds are too young to understand, so it's very important for mentors to help them realize that it's better to accomplish from education, than to suffer in the real world.

For example, high school students who work after school, never find the time to come home and focus on completing their school activities. Because of their job that's holding them back. As a student, it's commonly stressing to go through these types of stuff. In fact, no high school student should have to go through these type of things. They have a whole life ahead of them and have the time to think about their goals. So, it's very important for students to focus on what's important, and not worry so much about what they want to achieve or accomplish in their career. The goal to everything is education, maybe some day when students accomplish their ways in education, they'll probably achieve the career that they've been looking for. ",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0
130CA439835B,"I think is good idea, because the students have more opportunity to graduate early. some school districts offer programs the allow school, student to graduate in three years. most students follow this plan, must take courses during the summers,or in the evenings or may not be able to take electives course. but if you finish,

the school in three year you need to study very hard to pass all the class.

is good to finish the school early too because you go to the college early and you have more time find a good job. but you need bring more focus in one class but not in other because the graduation, can be going down. but they need break too because most students going to sleep during the class because they study in the night i would like to thank all, the teachers give homework and they not finish because they, dont have time to complete. what can they do during the night they need to get energy, to continue study for the class.

some students are very smart but other students work during the night and they dont have time to do the homework because they came tire for the work, and they dont focus in the class and they no pay attention to the class because some students came from other countries they need to pay house need get foot, clothes and other thing to school but, they need to learn English first because they need to pass all the class for enter in the college,

and they can get good jab to save the money for the future ,they can buy his own house, and get a family they need more important thing the education is very important because they look good person no body say bad thing of he.

I think is good idea because you focus only in one thing. then you can study , just in the school but if you trying to graduate for bettor life if you graduate your parents be happy. because you comply your goals if you have a dream follow you can comply, but you need to focus in the school dont slept during the class, did the homework get good grade dont forget you need to graduate in three years. must students who follow this plan must take courses during the break. to study for the exam you need to be ready for the college, thinking about you life what do you do when you out the school, you getting good job they dont know, yet because we are in the college ,but they have a dream to follow in the college the most important is you get good grade to graduate because if you get good grade they know you are good students.

my opinion is if `you graduate early you have more opportunities to grow up. very first because you are ready for the new life, you can find good opportunities,

but you need to focus in one goals first because you can get good opportunities, away because you graduate for the college ,and school o ready. they families will be happy for his becuase he get good result in the college.                                ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0

And also that we will work together and talk as a groups for the teacher because working alone is hard to think for the one question that you don't know what is about. So many of students think working as a groups is better will help each other However, teacher will thinks many from us that will improve from talking each other and together. Because the student will do more stuff and talk a lot also as a groups and alone because many student will do that to get focus and pay attention the class.

This why that people prefer working with a group is better. Because the reason that we want working as a group is that we will work together and help out the question to talk and give a convince from the work. That we will don't know the answer from the question or the problem because for example, well you think that as a sport you need to be in a group that play together, talk together, and work together as a team is the same thing in the school or other place. For the other example, you saw the cartoon of luney toons that bugs bunny and the duck doing the play for the opera that people will laugh this is call working together as a team to do funny thing in the cartoon shows.

So many of student think working alone is better. Because you will achieve more thing be yourself and thinks more hard you never think before from the work. A lots of student and teacher think it will go better that working as a group well it going to be hard that whatever, that i need help or my friend need help we can not work together we only going ask the teacher for help for the question. Because many of student will do more better job in the class to do work and think more stuff outside the place. For example, some singer that work alone because the there want to be alone that make a better song and to do something and plan yourself to leave anywhere you want to see a better life alone.

In conclusion some people like working with a groups and other half like working alone because the teacher said if you want work with a group go ahead if not you can work alone. So a lot of student show the teacher you can do both as a same time because it doesn't matter if want work as a group or alone because there will give you plenty of time that to do same thing as a group and alone.

School online may help others then going to actual school. Maybe the person is going through something in school. Doing school at home my be easier for some students,

they probably learn quicker and probably finish school faster. Others may not work that way, some maybe work slower in school, so they wanna work at their own paste . Others may just wanna tryout school at home.

Many people believe that having a healthier school menu is a good idea because it lets students become healthy. The cafeteria should not change their lunch menu to a healthier school menu. It effects the students learning if they are not happy with their food, their parents pay for students school lunch, also students won't be used to the new healthier menu.

Students learning would be effected if they are not happy with their food. Students need food that they enjoy to motivate themselves. Students can't learn if they aren't treated with right food. If the cafeteria is not serving good menus, students will have a bad mood. It is important to give and treat students good food so that they will like being at school.

Parents aren't just paying their kid's school for nothing. Parents are paying for their child's school lunch to make them enjoy themselves at school and to learn. Students will be social if they are having a good meal at lunch. Students will also be active if they are getting the right food. Therefore it is important that the school needs to think about the students health.

Students would not be used to the new healthier menu, they would hate it. They will bring their own lunch because students don't like eating the school meals. It will also make parents stop paying for their child's school lunch. When most of students aren't eating the school food, other students will follow their footsteps. Moreover it is important to not change the school's menu because they won't get used to it.

Identifying a career by the time the students enter to High-School, is probably a chance to see if they are actually interested in the career that they had in mind, when they were in middle school. This is the time when you have to start picking ideas for what you want to be when get older. This doesn't mean that your not allow to change your mind in the future, is just a help from the school to see if you are interested in what you want to do when you get older. You have four years in high school to change your mind. There is so many careers that you could like; the school will provide you the classes that you need in order to graduate, and also classes that talk or teach you about the career that you pick. That's when you have to start thinking if that's what you actually like, and remember that whatever you pick, is not permanent for your entire life, because you can change your mind any time.

Don't stress out a lot, because as a freshman you can change your mind for the year that is coming up. You have another year to pick new classes and see what is that you actually want to be. Identifying a career by the time the students enter to high school, is probably a chance to see if they are actually interested in the career that they had in mind. You have around ten month in school, in those ten month you have the chance to know more about the career that you pick in the beginning, so while the time past by, you can see if you are actually interested in the career for your future. If is not what you thought it was going to be, then for your next year you can talk to your counselor about it, and they will help you giving you advises, because they are allow to see you grades, so they will see in what classes you doing good, so they can help you pick a career that you would probably like.

Student have the right to change their mind any time that they want, because the 75% of the students that are in High-School are not mature enough to actually think in their future, most of them are not ready for life. When you are in your last year of high school, is when you have to start getting ready with what you actually like, and see whatever classes that you had picked in the beginning of high High-School was actually what you wanted to be in the future; because after that you will be going to collage. It is a good idea to give the students the chance to identify their career in the beginning of High-School. Also their mind will change every year, the years that actually matter in order to go to collage is junior and senior years. Those years are the ones that you have to get ready and actually put on your mind that any classes that the school will put you in will be a guide toward the specific career that you have picked.

The classes that you have in High-School is just a help to open your mind for the career that you could have in the future. It can be helpful for some students and for others it would not matter at all. It is not necessary to identify only one career when you are just entering to High-School, because you are most likely to change your mind and ideas about the career. There is a chance that you will forget what you wanted to be as a young age. While the time past by there will be so many other cool career that you will be interested to do, or to learn more about. When you are picking your classes and your counselors and you talk about your future, or what would you like to do when you go out of High-School; is a good chance to let them know your ideas and your goals, so they will know what classes to put you in so it can help you as guide for your career and also for collage.

In conclusion, giving the students the chance to pick classes that will guide them toward their career, can be helpful for them to see if they are actually interested in that career or no. If they don't like the classes that they have that is teaching them about the career; then probably is not actually the career that they want for their future. Is complicated for them to have only one career in their mind, because there is so many chances that while the time past by it will become hard or boring for them. In the other hand most of the students is High-School have change their mind, and you can ask any person while their working, if the job that they have right now, is actually what they picked when they were in High-School. Most of the times is better if we give students chooses for their career and future. ",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0

I made the noise all the time, I could do it and no won could stop me except myself. The only reason I really never stopped was because i made my friends laugh and i made jokes. The first example was I making what does the fox say and I made my weird noises. The second example was I randomly out of nowhere I slowly looked at my friends and stared right at them and i quickly made a lobster position and chased them well making the noise. I make a lot of noises at school but at home its even worse.

When am at home thats when I strike with the noises. I really liked annoying my sisters all the time. But, they punched me because I was being annoying because I always made the noises. The first reason they would punch me was because I sat right next to them and started making the noise, and less the two seconds she punched me really hard on the shoulder. The second reason was when I went in my sister room and started pocking her when i was making the weird noises and she got so mad she punched me on my chest that really hurt. But, now I really don't make the noises anymore i got tired of it myself. But, I do it on accident sometimes when im playing games.

If they get paid less they will not be able to pay for their kid's college. Or out of school activities like horseback riding and soccer. Or even paying for a nanny or a babysitter to watch their kid so they can get paid more. Second if kids are at school longer they will learn more and get smarter. If people learn more and get smarter they will have a higher a chance in getting in to a good college. If they get in to a good college they will have a higher chance in getting a good job. If they get a good job they will get good money to help their families out someday. In the conclusion that's why I agree with adding one and a half hours to school each day. That's why you should accept my position.,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0
1703E46B4DC9,"People this days deal with a lot of issues . Its clear that sometimes adults also need help with making their own decisions. Most of the time we tend to think that because we're adults we are doing the right thing, but instead we're doing the opposite. Once you start to see the downfall,or the bad things that have started to happen to you or the people close to you because of the decisions that you made, its time for you to go for to seek for guidance. Its best that you seek help before you're life falls apart.

Guidance has helped a lot of people with their daily lives. The best part about it is that their's no age limit for when you can and can not go. For example high school students have the privilege to go for guidance at school anytime they need it. One important thing that high school students are given during guidance is to always pick the classes that will help them in the future. Going for guidance should begin at an early age. When you start going, you get to understand the aspect of life and the decisions that you make as you move on with you're life. Its a great place to go when you have no idea of what you're going to do with you life or how to make the right decisions.

The best part about going for guidance is that you are assured you'll be talking to an expert;meaning that they are able to control themselves in any situation and talk to you in any circumstance. Most of the people who hold these jobs have degrees and are licensed to do that work. For most people,talking to someone the do not know is easier that talking to someone who they know. In this case it's easier to open up to an expert who will soon give you advice and what to do next with you're life.

After all maybe guidance isn't a good place to go. One of the reasons that people don't seek for guidance is that it's too expensive. Most people can not afford to go for guidance every month or week. You need to have some form of income or at least be making a decent amount of money in order for you to afford it. The second reason would be, you're not really sure that the decisions that the experts make for you will be helpful. Its not always good to rely on what people say or when people tell you what to do with your life. In the end we are the ones who know ourselves better than anyone else does.

In conclusion most of us still need help with the decisions that we make. We all make good decisions and bad choices. As we grow we deal with so many things and sometimes its good to always talk with an expert. After all we're not perfect but the best decision for you is to seek guidance. You will be surprised by the outcomes of it.                 ",4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0
17085E68BA88,"Personally, I have been able to find myself to be able and do more when I'm up and active, as in doing something good for me, someone else, or in general. It's like you're able to do more once you're up and you are able to tell yourself that you can do better and you can do more than what you're supposed too. As Jefferson said ""it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Sometimes you can be so into the work and time can fly and you can get so much done with no distractions.

When I am doing something positive for myself and I want to do more, I find me telling myself a lot ""what good will this do to me?"" or ""where will it get me?"" I'm sure that I'm not the only one asking myself questions like these when I want do something good for myself or my life. When we are doing something for us, we can ask ourselves questions like the ones I stated. Once we do more than what we want to do and keep a positive mindset about it, that can be able to stick with us and become a good habit we can carry on in our lives. Which is amazing. We'll be able to strive for the best for ourselves and others when we carry on a good habit like that and show others how much we care about not just ourselves but others as well. We can always be able to carry a positive mindset with us and we can pass that on to others and it'll be able to motivate people to do more than what we can do once we are up and doing something.

I really tend to look at the bright side a lot and look at what is at the end or the outcome, when I'm trying to strive for the best by doing the absolute best that I can. We may have our moments where we can get tired of doing the most, but then we are able to tell ourselves how much the hard work is worth at the end when we do the most of what we're supposed too. Once we do the best that we can, we can reflect on it later on in life and be so proud of ourselves and tell ourselves how tired we were for doing the most but how much worth it all was at the end. I have my moments where I can be so tired of trying my best and just want to give up. But then I take a step back, look at my work, and once I'm done and I tell myself how proud I am because it got me far. We also are able to have no regrets at the end of the day and reflect on it and see how dedicated we were and still are to this day. We can tell others our story and say how proud you are for yourself and see how dedicated you were and still are for doing what you can and doing better. Not in any bragging type of way but to motivate them in a way. You're able to pick up the habit of being so dedicated to bettering yourself or others by doing more once you're doing. It's like self motivation, telling yourself ""you can do more.""

Once we pick up this good habit of accomplishing more than what we are supposed too, we motivate not just ourselves, but others as well to do more and more. Like I said, we can look at the bright side of it always, and feel nothing but good and proud of ourselves at the end. When we build this good habit and do the most, we are able to do the more than what we could before and little by little building that up. At the end of accomplishing what you could, you are able to tell others what the hard work and dedication gives you at the end of it all. As well as how far it get's you in life. It can sometimes motivate others to strive for the best and it can help them, sometimes they need to hear you out for it to motivate them. What I like about it is that, when we are able to pick up this good habit of ours, we can tell others about it and it can motivate them to do the same. It's like we talk them into to striving for the best for themselves and others in life. It's like we are passing this good habit we've built down and then it just keeps going and going. Sometimes hearing others out really helps others a lot.

When you are able to just take a moment and take one step back, it really is possible for you to accomplish more than what you can when you're doing. You motivate not just yourself but others when you really are dedicated to doing your best and it can become a good habit. You're able to pass that down and it can give you a positive mindset to it all. The outcome can turn out to be good and make you feel good about yourself at the end. It can get you so far in life as well and you're able to look back at the most that you have accomplished and have no regrets about any of it. It is truly motivational and can truly help if you are really dedicated to it all.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0
171E655CC8F1,"Attend classes from home by way of online can be a good idea but , in my position is not a good way for the student and can be innecesary or bad idea in many reasons.

When the student is in home he going to do what he want he don't care the class he going to feel like if he don't have to do have to work in that class and he don't thing if he going to lost the class, one example is one of my friends he have a oline class but when he is in home he dont work because he dont care because no have one teacher who says ""Work or you no going to pass the class"" and thats one reason.

My second reason is when the student is taken online classes he just going to finish, he no going to learn because he dont care learn he just going to complete the leasons but just that, why? because he dont have the teacher who explaing when he have questions or when he is interesting in something of the class he no have the teacher who know more abaut that.

Some people says when the student take the online class from home he are more concentrade however whent the student take this classes from home he are more distractic because he have the cellphone in his hand or he have the TV in the room, the dog, the play station and he going to prefer play or see movies than work on the classes.

In conclusion thye student can no work , no have the teacher for question or warn he can lostr the class or are more distractict or prefer play than work on the class are my reasons for no take online classes but with the good students can be a good idea.",3.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0
174C4761FEA2,"I agree to the quote

""Success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.""

In our life, in order to get what we desire is to overcome failures. It teaches us to become more stronger and to keep going without losing faith in pursuing our goals until we succeed.

Based on my experience, doing what i love is the most important thing. No matter how many times i fail; as long as i love it, i will keep going to reach my goal. I will not mind other people, even they're telling me to stop and give up. For me, failing is the way that life gives to be stronger.

Some people might think that life is very unfair, it just depends on how strong a person is to rise up after every falls. Every individual should have faith, in order to conquer challenges. Failing is just a word, it can't do nothing to stop a person to keep trying to pursue its goals.

Failing for me doesn't mean it's the end. It's a good experience, because it teaches lessons. Doing what i love motivates me more not to give up, instead i'll keep standing up after i fail in order to succeed.

In life, trying is not bad. Having faith and being enthusiastic is needed to overpass all obstacles by not giving up after failing. Keep trying to get what we want.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0

I was in walmart one day, than I saw a man with small legs and Generic_Name started make fun of how the man walked, talked, and the man heard him he asked Generic_Name if he wanted to do a biking raise with him, Generic_Name said yes, they did the raise and the man with small legs own. After that Generic_Name never made fun of anyone he saw. A problem is a chance for you to do your best because it can change your life and it can teach you.

First of all, a problem can change your life. Oneday

I was at walmert and Generic_Name was telling his story of the past. He said, I used to steal, tell lies, I didn't listen to anyone and I also didn't work. One day, we went on a family vacation, on our way back we got hit by a truck and

I was the only one who surived in that accident. After that, I wanted to take my life, for I didn't see the reason of living anymore. Six months passed, and nothing was working in my life. Then oneday I went to the beach planing to take my own life he said, when I started walking toward the water I saw a man sitting in the sand. He asked me, who are , my name is Generic_Name

I said, and I started telling the man my story. Then the man said, your life matters the reason why you survived the accident that night is because it wasn't your time yet, your life matters because you are still breathing said the man, that is a gift because there are people out there wishing they don't have machines helping them to breath. These words changed my life, he said, I didn't forget about my family but I fixed my life for the good. This evidence shows that Generic_Name used to steal, tell lies, didn't work and didn't listen to anyone, his family got into a care accident and he was the only one that surived, he wanted to take his own life but all that changed when he met a man at the beach who opened his eyes. clearly, a problem is something that can take your life to the next level.

In addition, a problem can teach you. There was this man named Generic_Name, he was a faithful man he helped people in need with what he had, Generic_Name had eleven children, five boys and six girls. All his children were trained to help people in need. One day, something happened, a messanger came to Generic_Name and told him that his house was set one fire, and his children were in there. Everything that Generic_Name owned was destroyed, Generic_Name, who was Generic_Name's wife, was not pleased with what happened. Generic_Name's friends told him to repent maybe he did something bad to his God, but he said he didn't sin against anyone, his wife told him to curse God and he will die , but Generic_Name didn't. Oneday Generic_Name got really mad that he shouted at God and when he did that he remembered years ago, Generic_Name promised to give a family some food and kept saying I will give you some food I promised, but Generic_Name will always forget. The whole family died because of Generic_Name. When he remembered this Generic_Name asked forgiveness to God, and he forgave Generic_Name. Everything he had was restored. This evidence shows that Generic_Name lost everything he had, but at last he remmbered his mistake and asked for forgiveness. Clearly, we can learn from our problems.

Why schools allow the students to visit the companies? Because many students are interesting about business and other types of jobs that they might want to explore. In some schools the workers of the company come to the school to talk with students about the different opportunities they have in the future. The manager of the company should chose me because I have a good grades, I am interesting about business, and I want to learn more every day about business and I work hard .

First, I have a good grades in all of my classes. The teachers talk good things about me with others teachers and my uncles. I pay attention in class I do my homework every day. I missed school when I am sick or I have an appointment. I stay after school if I need to retake a quiz or if I need to print some papers in the library. I don't use my phone during class because I like to in focus what the teacher says I turn my phone off.

Second, I am interesting about business because I want to be manager of companies. I always interesting about this career when was 12 years old I said I want want to be manager of companies. Now I am 19 I still want to be manager of a company. After High School I want to go to college to study about business and prepare for can find a job about manager of companies.

1928846BB272,"I believe that is good idea for the students to commit to a career at a young age. Instead, it is important for the students to find the specific career and graduate before time. In point of view, some students can choose, if they want to a specific career or more. In thesis statement, students can find the specific career because is great opportunity and good idea.

First reason, some students are considered to find the specific career. Because they want to enter to the college at their young age. For example, Generic_Name was prepare to enter to the college at her 17th years old and she win a scholarship, and enter to Generic_School to study her specific career. This shows that students can achieve their goals at their young age, that nothing is impossible.

Second reason, some students have to find the specific career. Because they want to prepare before graduate of high school. For example, Generic_Name had her classes pass and all the credits before 12th grade and she apply to the college to her specific career. Being students it's not easy to achieve this specific goal, but with work hard and perseverance all is possible.

Third reason, some students think that they can't commit to a career at a young age. Because they don't have courses to guide toward a specific career. For example, Generic_Name is in 12th grade and she wants to graduate before, but she don't pass her SOL and she have the enough credits for graduate. So this shows that students can't commit to a career. If they don't have everything that is necessarily to find the specific so they cannot achieve anything.

In conclusion, it is important for the students to find a specific career at a young age. However, it is a great idea to find the career that proponent to achieve before the time of graduate and get all that you need like: credits, grades,

exams, and courses. Also, this is a great opportunity if you want to be someone professional in this society. So be positive and perseverant.     ",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.5,3.0
194E86ED4117,"My dad usually told me that failure is the mother of success when i was young. Way to success is not easy, everyone had to face different kinds of problems. It will fell harder and harder every time you failed, and it's hard to keep up the enthusiasm while facing different kind of problems. Yes, i'm fully agree with Mr. Churchill.

Failure lead you to success. Simple example about Elon Musk, one of the richest people on planet Earth. He was the Chairman of PayPal, Tesla. At 2002 he invented SpaceX, first ever self-investment rocket company to reach the Earth's orbit. Also, most amazing thing is they invented the reuse rocket, which is the rocket will land back to earth after launch to the Earth's orbit. SpaceX has accomplished so many that people talk about their success so much without remember their failure. Let me tell you this: The first 2 of their rocket(Falcon 1) launch are all failure due to engine failure. after during a other year of researching, testing, and examine, the 3rd rocket launch still failed to reach the Earth's orbit. At that time everyone think this project is a jock and Elon only have the money to launch the 4th rocket. Without losing hope and years of hard work, their 4th rocket(Falcon Launch 4) was successfully launched and reach the Earth's orbit. Elon and SpaceX made history, SapceX also received a large amount of money by NASA.

Don't ever lose your enthusiasm(Hope). Don't Never Ever Give Up, one of the greatest quote of all time, it lead so many people to success. Like Elon Musk i talked about last paragraph, he is a great example for us. His enthusiasm and passion about Space transpiration in the future and even moving people to space lead him and his company into success. I'm a sports athlete, i play basketball for 5 years already, it's part of my life. Every athlete knows practice is boring but also important. Why so many people still play professional basketball is because they have the passion and enthusiasm about winning. Process is boring and long, however it only take one moment for sports athlete to fell everything is worth it. Still some people failed on their way, beat by the tiredness of the process and slowly lose their enthusiasm for what they are chasing for at the beginning.

Failure complete the adventure, last thing i'm going talk about today. Everyone is emotional, everyone hate losing, everyone wanted to take the short cut. I'm the everyone, you are the everyone too, but without the gaps on the road to success, the adventure just seems not complete. Every failure make the explorer more stronger and smarter. Learn from the mistake, take note from it and you will be step ahead from everyone else. Every person on this planet with big accomplishment also have big mistakes too. No one is perfect, just go do thing what you want or like to do, eventually the journey will become interesting.

All for all, guess you already tired of reading. i support my 3 main points: Failure lead you to success, don't ever lose your enthusiasm, failure complete the adventure. I'm also agree with Mr. Winston:'' success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.'' Failure does play a important role in the pursuit of success.",3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5

I mean the teacher ask them if they want to work with a group or do it alone but they always chose to do it alone because they don't know anyone in the class or they don't feel like working with anyone that means they wanted to look cool about it. so that would mean more work for them, What i feel that is more beneficial is working in a group.

When working in a group you have less work to do because everyone has a different job to do for example, let's say you have a project and it is a group project everyone has a job to do like one person could be doing research, another person can be working on the poster/PowerPoint,and the last person can be the one presenting it to the class.

people could say that working alone is better and much quite, However working in a group means to making new friend and getting the work done much faster.

Working in a group isn't really that bad you can have some fun when you are working in a group like making new friend asking when they can stay after so you can do the project together or going to each others houses planning on what you should do with your project. But it is really fun when you are working with your friends,Working with your friends is fun because you would be laughing all day and you might or might not get some work done but that just depends on the kind of friend group you have. There are some who would be focus and get the work done but there are others who would be laughing and get nothing done.

people could say that working with friends is distracting, However having to work with your friends would be really easy and fun.

It's much easier for the students to work in group the can get together and work things out with each other instead of them doing it alone and they don't have anything planed like no ideas at a lot then it's good to have a group because they can bring new ideas. New plans like everyone can have their ideas on their project plus it would be nice seeing what the student made see what each student has. It just shows that everyone had different themes of there project. so when you work alone you just only see one persons ideas and that fine but when you are in a group you see everybody ideas.

Other might people say that one mind is good enough, However many minds would make a differences.

The reason people work by their self is because they might think that working in group is too distracting and it's not fun when people keep on talking. But working with other people will help make things faster and fun but also you get to give your own opinion about things and you get to work together plus you get to learn a lot from your group.

1B056DE0E856,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote "" unless you try to do something beyond what you have already master, you will never grow."" But i thing that when people work hard on something, even thou they all already don it, but they did poorly on it, So when they do it again thats haves them another opportunity to do it batter. For example when i was in eighth grade i had a lot of tribal how to spell in English, because i was from another country, could Generic_City. So all the time i could not spal a ward, so i will get sad, but in the minet or two i say to my self "" dont worry"" so to answer the cwesten that Author Ralph Waldo Emerson try to say, no i don`t believe that when people have already mastered in something they cant do it again.

First, Work hard, people work very hard in something because they want to secid in the futurr. When some one bin doing something for so long even thou they did moltipal times. They can do it again, just to be batter ate it. They never hive up on something, because when some one haves up on something that they bin like in it, they will fail. Think positive about staff because when some people dont thing positive. Even no it`s hard for them to desalt what they what to do in the future but they did the same thing over and over, but when they work had and have that positive mind they will do it well . For example, my first year playing soccer on the high school teem, it was hard for me to understand what people was saying to be, but two three years later i had no tribal understanding what they war saying to me. So that shows that i speak English for three years and know i can understand what people saying to me because i bin spike net for three years.

Second, Dont wary about staff, stay on track. People like to do something and finished, because when they finished it fills much better then before. When i take a test it makes me woride but when i finish it, it fills much better because my mined can relax form it. Even thou i still think what Caind of graid will get. Fist Complete the staff that is hard to do then do the easy staff later. When some people do their home work, they do the hard problems first and they do the easy staff, because it helps them to counchenteit on the hard staff first. When i have a problem that is very hard i will ask the teacher for help me with it, so that i can do the easy staff by my self.

However, Some people ,like Author Ralph Waldo Emerson think different then the other people. for example when some one has a high school digry they just want to get out of school because if they did it again they will think that they will fail it. Most of the people like to finish something or accomplish something so they work very hard just to get that one thing like the pay check or college digry just to finish the last staff because they don`t want to do it. again because think that it will me waist of time. Some people look only for one thing but not the other. for instens that young man wants to play profashanal basketball, but he not thinks about school or nothing he just wants to play basketball and so when he tries out for a team and he never maid it so he just going to have up because he never grow to be a profeshanal basketball player. It dos it matter what some people do to, to be batter at something that they going to do it again but they will never grow.

Therefore what Author Emerson try to say that people if the have already mastered ,you will never grow. So to say that people can do something that they want to do and they can do it as much time as they want to and they will sicsid in it. Even thou it hard, but some people can do it multiple times. So when they do it again thats haves them another opportunity to do it batter. So to answer the cwesten that Author Ralph Waldo Emerson try to say, no i don`t believe that when people have already mastered in something they cant do it again.

1BAD681F72CB,"I think It will be enjoyable to couplet a science experiment because is an educational activity. You can have fun,you can work and meet with different persons,and you can learn more about the subject.

First of all I think It will be fun couplet a science experiment because I like sciences and I can learn more about experiment. Also I love going to my sciences class when we do experiments because It fun. I always laugh when I do experiment and they don't work. Another thing that I think sciences is fun is because you never know if the experiment will be work. One day me and my little cause we did smile in the kitchen and my mom gets mad and she make me clean the whole kitchen but, then we did smile in school and I already knew how to do it.

Secondly when you are doing a science experiment You always have to work in groups sometimes with your friend's sometimes not. For me its cool to work with different persons because when you do not know something and you ask them and they know they will help you and thats why for me is enjoyable to do sciences experiments because I'm a friendly person. One day in my sciences class we were doing an experiment then a new student came and the teacher ask me if I could help him and I said ''yes'' because he just knew Spanish and I help him and we became friend.

Then doing a sciences experiment it not just to have fun is to learn more about the subject that you are learning because is no the same doing the experiment then just listing to the teacher explaining. A lot of time this has happen to me that Im listing to the teacher but I don't understand nothing but when we do the experiment I do understand.

In conclusion for me completing a sciences experiment is one of the my favorite things because we don't just learn we have fun and thats why I like it. Also to complete a sciences experiment you do different things you don't just stay sit you move around. At the being of the year I did't speak to much English and it was hard to understand the teacher but when we start doing experiment it was more easy and now I understand more and that make me feel happy and that one of the reason I enjoy doing experiments.",3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0
1BC40A063549,"I am agree with this prompt, i think that everyone have to believe in their self-reliance, Because we have to follow our own ideas to be a unique person and believe in our decision in the life.

the only way that you can be a successful on your job or on your life is believing in your own ideas and value your self-reliance, and never think that you cannot do nothing because you can.

the only thing that you have to do is believe in your own instincts and ideas and don't let other to tell you something different.

i will like to reckon in my self-reliance to be a better person in this world and don't depend of other person to get my dreams.

(people who believe and value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas).

1-the school is one good example for this is because the school give you exams and work for do on your own self,

- the school give you a lot of challenge one of them are the tests, for get good grates on those test you have to self-reliance to study and pass those test.

2-the work (jobs) is other best examples,they give you the opportunity to show them that you are a excellent employee and that you can create your own ideas.

-the work is other place to explain the self-reliance, your boss is asking you if you can do a work for him and that work is important for him because he ask to other workers but they copy the work from other company so he belief that you can do the things better that other and you have to self-reliance for that work and create your own ideas for it.

3- on my own life, the idea to choose what we have to do on the future is because our parent want that us get the best opportunities but sometimes we don't want to do the things that our parent tell us because we want to do the best thing for be the best but not like they want we want to do the thing on my own way.

conclusion i believe that, we always have to self reliance because, that help you doing things that you never imagine that you could do that, and never keep focus in just one thing, put your mind open for make better decisions and follow your instincts for do the best that you can,

my conclusion is that you always have to believe in your self-reliance and always follow your dreams for more hard that those things can be but that is the opportunity for your self-reliance and show that you can do the things that you want if you bring your ideas and follow your dreams.",3.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0
1BD023792E29,"In my point of view, I feel what is more beneficical is working alone. You might think working in a group is more beneficial, but let me tell you why is it not a good idea. It lets you concerate more on your work and won't let you get distracted and get off topic with the rest of the group. On top of that it gives you the chance to slightly get your work done in a matter of time. On the other hand, in case you don't understand a topic,it benefits you learning alone so next time you understand it in the future time. In this way of working alone, has many benefits and could help you in many ways in the long run.

Have you ever been part of a group at somepoint in your life, and your group gets off topic and ends up not finishing the work that was assigned? It really isn't such a productive group like that I could say. Say perhaps you were trying to get your work done, but you entire group wants to do unproductive things and gtet off topic. Have you ever thought who gets the blame after? Your group gets the blame and you as well. Even if you were being on topic and getting your assignment done, but your also part of the group, what could you do. Let me give you an example. There was once where my math teacher said we could work in a group. Me and my group were getting our work done, until one of my group members gets off topic. There goes my whole group off topic. What was the result after, my group didn't finish the assignment. Next thing you know who got the blame that day. My whole group and including me as well. I explained to my math teacher in a nice, clamy matter to her, that I was trying to get my work done, she didn't lose an energy listening to me.

What if you teacher for example set a timing to finish the project, and you couldn't finish in time because of the silliness in your group? I'm positive you would want to finish in time and get a good grade. I'm more than certain that you don't want to finish late with your group and get a zero as your grade from your teacher. I've have so many examples, but let me tell you one that stood up to me and left my eyes bright open. My biology teacher had told the whole entire class there was a project due at the end of the class. So she told us to get in groups, of four people in the group. Long short story, my group got way off topic and didn't finish in time. At the end,we all got zero's and for a week I had a zero bringing my grade down. I brought my grade up, until it was test day. I've been through so many experiences, I enjoy working alone. On the other hand, I also experienced understanding a topic on my own, which feels great let me tell you.

Have you ever experienced in life going or thinking of a topic and not understanding? That has happened to me once. Where your at a point,where you don't understand a topic, but learning on your own kicks in. Everytime you go back and reazlied what you did wrong, it all kicks in, in the future. Which in my point of view is a good benefit. Learning on your own is denfitnely not a bad thing. There was once where I was having quite the trouble at a topic, in my class of english, but the outcome wasn't so bad. As I could say. In that certain assignment I got a high B. I learned after where I needed more information on that topic in my english class. On the next assignement I had I got a high A.

Working alone has many benefits and could benefit you in the long run. Many poeople think its beneficial working in a group, but I say no. Want to do better, get a good result after, get a nice dencent grade after. Working alone is the solution. Don't let anyone trick you into saying it's bad, because it is most ctertainly not a bad choice/idea. If you come across a point to work in a group, thats great, i'm not saying never work in a group. Although at some points when the stitution is series to get an assignment done, thats were working alone comnes in handy.",3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5,4.5
1BE638E9C951,"School Extracurricular Activity

I agree, all students should do Extracurricular Activity in school and outside of school. I feel like it will help them out with a lot of stuff like stress and can help them find out who they really are. It can give them time to be with friends and can also give them the chance to met new people. And it can bring the teachers and students closer to each other. This would give them the chance to get to know each other and try new things out.

Extracurricular Activity's would be so helpful to the school's community. This program can also help kids not be on their phones as much. it would help kids come all together and work as a team. I feel like now in days kids dont really care about there Schools Extracurricular Activity's. I feel like a lot of kids\teens depend on this phones for answers, ideas, and etc. these ideas will show them that there are better stuff then just being on your Phone, iPad, and Computer.

These school activity's will probably also bring students and teachers closer. Student's most of the time dont like school so these Activity's can show them that school can be fun. These activity's will give kids a chance to see the bright side of school and also the true meaning. It will also teach kids that trying new things out with new people can be fun. These programs can really make a kids or teens life a huge impact.

Extracurricular Activity's can show kids how to be more outgoing and bring the shy kids out of the shy zone. These Activity's can teach kids so many life lessons. It help kids and teens who think they are lazy turn into great students. These Activity's can inspire students to do better in school and lift there grades up. It can help kids/teens find out what they truly love and what they truly dislike.

I hope my words help out community's who are thinking about putting Extracurricular Activity's in there School system. I truly agree with these activity's and think it will help a lot with kids/teens. I hope one day all schools have fun activities for there students. I think can help many students come out into the real life and show them the true meaning of life. I love this idea so much and wish the best of luck for community with these activities.

1DB195AA7BE3,"Well the best option for my is what you attend the classes from home by way of online .

My reason or my thought is, what you cant learn, in online classes, and thought what you can do it , doing others wor,k in you free time, and the school has good ideas for student what take, classes like after school just in home . So in my position is that because if you work so is you cant take the class for one hours, and you work ,and is more benefit for myself but ,each person has diferent ideas .

Examples:

If you not have work is more time for you ,for what you keep doing you class online.

If you wnat the class . you has more time for to think best for work online and make a good work and your class.

With this examples are much more for what you take any option or my option what is the best or most better already is in you home .

If you not have time like time complete is for that what you take this option ya what has work and not time like for stay in the school all the time .

Others examples is whent you have 18 year old has to much resposabilities and others case it 's not easy .

I think whent a teacher said you need that class is for one reason, and you nedd take that class but you cant took with you teacher what, is most better for you. So and my opinion or my position is take class from home in online, and to much better what ,take video coferencing.

One reason because im take that option is because in my home is relax, and with food and alone and not voices and nothing, and in my home take my time for think most better i think is the most important for my work in home and i think what the work in online is not easy so need my time for to think, and good ideas and good answer, and the idea is what you learn with any option you take for this case . The student in this time has more option for any problem . One reason for what i take this option is for the time ya what much student are major or not have much time for coming a school because the work or others case. Other reasons what the student take this option is beacuse is home not in other pleace ya what not has ride or cars for take that class or classes en other pleace .

My intentions is what others student take this option what is classes from HOME because is the best ,option for any case too if you want free time is more easy for you take this class or classes home by way of online, and is more choice that idea and minus dificult just what in home or online you not have teacher for explain any question so for that reason is little complicate but not impossible make you work so you cant do it , forever you want , nothing is this life is impossible but too not is easy everthing is sacrifice. Abd you has see you work good and past the class sin difucult .

My reference is the option class

FROM HOME BY WAY OF ONLINE. Is the best option and more benefif for learn in home, and more easy for the time or others problem and i cant wait what everthing stay good for my cass or classes .

Imagination is important because without it, how did people make the things we have now, because they use there imagination. If you imagine it hard enough it might come true. Scientist are making medicine to cure the sick, why do they do that? Because they imagined that if there was no medicine then half of they human population would die, so they make medicine. If there were no police then our world would be full of criminals and destruction so they imagined to make a police station and people became cops. You can also help out the world.

If you had a mind filled of knowledge but with barely any imagination then that would be the same as eating an Oreo with a dusting of cream in the middle. Just constant knowledge is boring, but adding imagination is like adding sprinkles on to a boring vanilla cake. Quantum physicist, Albert Einstein once said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" Einstein is indeed correct because there are many ways imagination is more important than knowledge.

One reason why imagination is greater than knowledge is that of the ability to imagine the unthinkable. For example, how do you think Albert Einstein learned and explored the unknown of quantum physics? He used his mind to imagine the unthinkable. How you think Elon Musk came up with the idea to start a colony on Mars? He imagined in it all in his head. How do you think Steve Jobs invented the iPhone? He used imagination to gain that knowledge. Imagination is what fuels the mind to create knowledge. It's all in the head, that's where it all starts from.

Another reason why imagination is important is because of the benefits of using your imagination often. For example, using your imagination often will have you obtain a more creative and detailed mindset overall. You can also do many cool things using your imagination such as lucid dreaming, invent new ideas, or even train your mind to see the world in a different way. You should always use your imagination often to strengthen it. You should also try lucid dreaming to come up with brand new or more innovative idea while using your already known knowledge.

Finally, the last reason why imagination is more important than knowledge is that it can change you mentally and physically. How imagination can change you mentally as a person is by making you a better person or be a more fun person overall. How imagination can change you physically as a person is by motivating you to be a better by work outing and or going on jogs pretty often. As a result, using your imagination can change you in many ways as described above, unlike knowledge.

In conclusion, I agree with Einstein and his idea about how imagination is more important than knowledge. Using your imagination is benefiting, motivating, changing all in different ways. No matter who you are, you will be changed by the different ways imagination can affect you and on your already known knowledge. Imagination is alot more important than you think it is.",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0
20AA145EB328,"Some people believe in praising a students work to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the best effort. They believe that the students must be self confident in order to learn. Others believe that praise given to deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. They believe the source of true self-esteem is achievement. True self-esteem is from achievement, it encourages students reach their goals, being a good role model , and being determined for their success.

Students self-esteem comes from achievement, once one goal is achieved students will have confidence, which will cause students to achieve more goals. Students achieving their dreams will encourage others to try their hardest to succeed more. Students will become better leaders by encouraging others to accomplish their dreams as well. This will give students a mindset to not give up easily. When students see others achieve their goals it gives them hope to be able to do the same, which leads to students trying their best to turn in their assignments on time and give their full effort on topics they're given.

However, students having success allows them to be good role models for older and younger generations. Students prove others whats like to achieve their goals and have the emotional support they need to continue their dreams. Students set a good example on how others can accomplish their own goals. Students having confidence and helping others achieve their dreams helps build their self-esteem, which helps students learn better about others and ways to accomplish more goals. Being a good leader will help in many different ways to succeed by, helping others with emotional support and guiding them to their dreams. Students will be very confident when their goals have been accomplished and helping others to succeed as well.

In conclusion, Self-esteem comes from achievement. Students build their self-esteem by encouraging students to try their best on assignments, having emotional support, and accomplishing their dreams. True self-esteem comes from achievement, it motivates and encourages students to reach their goals. Self-esteem leads students to become a good role model.       ",4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5,4.0,4.5
20E2B07931F3,"Once in a while we all have been heard a phrase; ""TRY, TRY, UNTIL YOU SUCCED"". We all have been gone through failing, at some part of our lives. But we never give up and we do our best. And at the end we get more of it. Yes we accomplish more if we are always doing something. There are few people who don't agree to this statement. They say doing something more will not let you do other work. But rather than seating ideal, we should always try new things around. Trying new things can give new experience. Also, you can get better at things. And, moreover it also makes you strong. Rather than seating ideal, doing nothing; we should always keep on trying new things.

We humans always have dreams of doing things like: Sports, Cooking, Adventure activities, getting into music, dance, and many more. Doing something and trying out new things will always give you new experience. I wanted to learn guitar from my childhood but, it was not possible when i was in school. During my last summer break i joined guitar classes. It was next level experience to me. I learned so many new things which i never knew about guitar. There, i also met new people and made new friends. Meeting new people and knowing interesting facts about their lives is also a new experience.

On the other hand their are some people who says trying new things don't give you experience, and it also wastes your time. But if we want to at least full fill our dreams then we have to keep on working hard.

There are few people who argue; doing same things everyday won't give you anything and you will also not able to focus on other things. But that's not true. Doing same thing again and again can make you better and you can be best in the future. let's just talk about me when i joined my guitar classes. On the very first day i didn't knew nothing about guitar. Their were lots of things like: cords, tunes, vocal. This all were like a big giant algebra equation which were kept in front of me, in which i didn't even knew how to solve for x. I knew a little bit of knowledge how to play with guitar string, but i never knew much things in details. On the very first day when i went to my guitar class i was not really good. But after continuing playing for a month i actually started improving at that. And today i'm really good at playing guitar.

There are many individual who says that trying new things is a fail. And later it demotivates you and make you feel depressed and upset. Many of us our not really good at things. We fail at many things at first. In this situation many of us give up and don't try to take a second chance. But do we actually know that failure is the biggest key to success and it also teaches you many lesson. I'm not really great student who can Handel math. I failed in algebra1 in my 9th. Every test, every quiz, i used to get D or either F. But failing at same things again and again until i started getting good grades thought me so many new things. And it also made me more stronger. Failing makes you more stronger so that in future also you can fight with it.

In conclusion seating ideal will never make you succeed. Trying new things is a opportunity to learn new things and explore things around you.                       ",3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0
20FB731C7598,"I think it is a good idea because if you finished with the career that you took, you have more time to take another career, you can start a project at a very young age and if these project did not work you have more time to try it again.

First, if you studied a career that you like before and now you dont like it, you have another options or opportunities to take another career for example, I have a friend she is 22 years old, she will to graduate the next year at the age of 23, she is very young and she is thinking to take another career that make her more professional.

Then, if you want to start a project you have a lot of ideas because the mind of the young people is incredible and if you fail it you can try and try again for instance If you want yo start a project like, you want people to work for you you can start something easy like clean houses and the money that you earn from that then you pay to them or you can put a store of clothes and you can to make your own company of clothes or you can have a restaurant and earn s extra money for these works.

They can study and work at the same time and earn money to pay his or her college, they can start a family while they are taking another career and if they learn a lot of things they have their own life.

Finally, I think it is a good but good idea because they become more professionals and they have more chances o have a great life, If you see more of the students are young and they work hard to have a amazing life, it is a good idea because you can help people to give them motivation and they can see you like a inspiration to go ahead.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5
21535555126A,"I agree that you shouldn't aim high, because when you aim high you never have a staring point to your own process, if you aim high it could ruin your work ethic and how you see yourself, and lastly you can make muiltiple mistakes and correct it and make it perfect work, compared to aiming and doing horrible work and falling back down to the bottom.

When you aim low you have way more time to gain information, practice on your work, and have a good idea on what you want to do. For example the creator of Microsoft Bill Gates he didn't just wake up one morning and said"" im going to create a software system named windows"" he woke up and began to study computers, and everything about how a software works. So aiming low gives you the advantage of failing and not giving up on what you want to become. Most people are always told to ""aim high"" the ones that are told to aim high will never be able to handle failure because they never aimed low first and then worked their way to the top, that is how setting your aim to high can make you fall short in life.

Aiming high, and having a high expectation can really hurt your work ethic, Why you ask? because once you aim high and never practice on your work thats how you fail, the way you work will not be the same compared to a person who aimed low and is making his or her way to the top. For example Delonte West was a NBA basketball player he was really good, until he began to use drugs once he did that he was kicked out of the NBA and is now currently poor. You see the reason why the NBA kicked him out of the league was because they have very high expectations for him and wouldn't expect him to do drugs at all but, if he was using drugs before he even entered the league and stopped using them completely and went to the NBA he would still be playing to this day that is a good example of aiming high and falling short and aiming low and achieving your mark.

The only way to start in any journey or process that you do is to start from the bottom meaning aim low and you'll achieve your mark. Aiming high can not benefit how you were able to make it to where you are now. That is true Michaelangelo was right about aiming high and falling short. So you must start low first figure out your plan, then begin to improvise and get ideas on what you want to do, and begin your process, that is exactly how you achieve your mark

In conclusion, i highly agree on what Michaelangelo said ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark"" that statement was true, Aiming and srting low first is how ideas come in and you are able to see what you are working and you show people what you can do until you reach your highest peak, instead of aiming high and failing and not knowing what to do now cause you failed. So start low first and go on from there.",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0
21884C3DC96A,"I like to work with a group because working with people helps you benefit from a lot of ways. One way is helping each others when working in a group. when i work with my friends we help each other with things that might be hard for us to do. I sometimes don't know how to answer a question so i ask the people i am working with to help me with it. The people you work with might not know something that i might know so that's a good thing when you work in groups. I like to help my friends or my group members with any thing because thats what group work is about.

2.

When working in a group we communicate a lot and talk about everything we have to do. i like to talk when i work in a group it even helps me learn more things that i did not know about. Sometimes i don't know how to say something in English so i ask my partner to help me say it or pronounce it. When i don't know something it's hard for me to talk about it or try to help when i don't understand what they are talking about. its good for me to work in group because it helps me learn more English.

3.

working in groups helps you and your partners to do less work. When i work in a group we split the work fairly if someone does not like the part he/she have to do we will give them a different one. For me i like to do the most easy one but i do not get that all the time sometimes i have to do a hard part and sometimes i have to do a easy part. I do struggle with things sometimes because i do not speak good English but i ask my partners to help me with what ever i do not understand.

4.

One way to get to know people better is working with them and talk to them. When i work with people it shows me who the person is and what they like to do. For me i like to know people better and make them comfortable around me even if they are shy. Some people don't like working in groups because they like to work by them self which is not a bad thing. Talking to people is one of my favorite things to do especially if i know the person more.

5.

It would be great for me to work in a group because it benefits me with a lot of things in a lot of ways. one thing is to get help from others and help others. The second thing is communication when u talk to people it helps me learn new things and they might be learning new things too, and i do not do as much work as if i was working by myself. its really good for me to work in groups because of all these things.

219A0A3B6B5D,"First each person decide what they want sometimes people have to make hard decision about any situation in their life. Also students have to decide what career should they take. Each person has the right to make their own decision about anything they propuse.

Second for example if a guy is in a relationship and he has to decide if he is going to stay forever with hes girlfriend. He has to decide but probably there will be opinions or probably he will need their parents help but the decision is hes. Also hes girlfriend have to make that decision too if she wants to marry him. However if both of them decide to marry each other that and agreement. They have define their decision.

Third for example some students started to choose their career early so they can have time to decide what career they want to choose. Some student are cumplicated for choose their career or what they want to be. Sometimes its hard for some students to choose a career sometimes students need help from their teachers. However the students can accept the teachers helped or opinions but the decison is the students.

Fourth for example every person has the right to decide what they want in their life. However young person sometimes they take wrong decision in their life. Sometimes Young people does not know what they want in that situation the parents has to help them to make the right decision in life. Although everybody has the right to decide what they want in life but some do not know therefore they required helped. Also it is important for them to learn and be more mature to take the right decison.

One reason i would like to be selected is because i would put one hundred percent of my attention and actually participate in all task we would have in the internships.

A reason i would like a shadowing opportunities is because i would like to see how a manager would deal with situations if a problem would ever happen when i would work. Shadowing would also be great for students would like to know how to make the job a little bit easier and faster to not waste time and sit around until a manager shows up and fixes the problem so they could start working again, that's why a shadow opportunities would be great to actually see how a manager would deal with a situation,

so then would later that we as interns would deal with the problems instead of calling a manager and waiting for him to solve it.

Shadowing is something i have never done before, i've always had interviews and get told that what i would be doing in a job that i applied for but have never really done it before getting hired to see if i would really would like the job i applied too, that's why our school gave us the chance to have the chance to be selected to be able to see if we would actually committed to the job we like and be ready to work.

22FDAB421C71,"Albert Einstein once said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge.""

I believe that it is Imagination is more important than knowledge, because with Imagination you can Form pictures in your mind, you can create interesting ideas and fantasize about something that is exciting.

Firstly, you can form pictures in your mind. Creating pictures in your mind is useful, because you can draw pictures that is in your mind, like sketching a house that you want. You can form pictures in your mind by visualizing a situation that is interesting, like playing a game in virtual world. You can create interesting ideas that you can use to draw picture, like using a digital art to create a picture by thinking an interesting ideas. Forming pictures is really important.

Secondly, you can create interesting ideas. You can create something that will give a lot of attention like creating a fantasy book about Wizards vs witches. You can be creative by creating interesting ideas, like having a unique plans about something that is cool. You can create quotes, like

Albert Einstein did, because he had a interesting Idea about Imagination.

Creating interesting ideas is unique.

Lastly, you can fantasize about something that is exciting. Fantasizing can be exciting sometimes, because you can imagine an situation that is not real, like having a awesome superpower. You can be good at something that your not good at by fantasizing it that you can do it, like playing basketball and I also do this a lot because Im not good at studying.

You can create awesome ideas, like building a wooden car with painting on it. Fantasizing something is important as well.

I conclude that forming picture in your mind, creating interesting ideas and fantasizing about something that is exciting is more important knowledge.

23F0ABEF8370,"Somepeople ask different people for their opinion. Because if you ask different people,people can have different opinion and they can have multiple answer.

First,people have different opinion. When people ask different poeple,people have multiple answer. For examole when i want to buy a pair of shoes i ask my mom, my dad, and sometimes i ask people that i do not know, but different people help me to see witch pair of shoes i should pick and there i can see what pair of shoes are the best. somepople do not like to know what other said when i think is better when everybody said their opinion

To continue,listen other opinion of different people make to choice better. Listen different opinion help us to know what other people think about it. For example my friend always ask me how she looks, so she want to know my opinion, and she dont only ask me. She ask different people to know their opinion. In the world are 58% of people who want to know other people opinion and their is 52% of people who do not care about what other people think about them. People want to know what other people think. Because that is how people can help to choice the best one. My opinion is that knowing what other people think help us to know more the other person think.

Finally, let people expres their opinion. If people know opinion of different persons,help us to pick better. For example sometimes i want to buy a pencil but i like two pencil, but i only have money for one. Their is when i need somebody to tell me witch one i should pick. I always tell somebody to tell their opinion. Because their is how people can expres theirself, and tell them that is cute or not. Instagram,instagram is a social media that a use for a lot of time,instagram sometimes help me. Because sometimes when i dont know witch one to pick, i post in my storie, i put .""What shoes i should to pick."", and their is when my frieds vote for what shoes i should pick, and i can make the best desition. I love to know what other people opinion because that help me to know what other people think about me.

In conclusion,my opinion is that every person in the world need to listen other person. Because if people have multiple opinion, people can have the better choose.

24C508ED6FE2,"It is true that there are many ways to influence others. Its not your behavior that defines your actions. Its how you show people by your actions, having goals and to have motivation to be able to influence others. Sometimes you dont even have to be positive to be able to influence others. For example, in the movie ""The Princess and The Frog"" , she wanted to open a restaurant because it was her dad's dream. So she kept working to get enough money to pay for a building she wanted. She didnt get it in the beginning, but at the end of the movie she did. What i'm trying to say is that she had one goal and it was to open a restaurant. she also had motivation to keep working to earn enough money to do so.

For my first reason why you can influence others in different ways is by your actions. The best way someone can influence others is by your actions. For example lets say you help out by donating food to your local food bank. That wont make much difference but if you do it daily, word will eventually get out on how you kept donating food for people in need. Especially if it gets on the news about the good deed you did, then more people would donate more to help out their community.

For my second reason why you can influence people in different ways is by having goals. Many people whit goals accomplish more that people without one. For example lets say that your trying to save money to buy a new game that coast eighty dollars. But you dont have any money left. So you do chores like cleaning, washing your parents car, or cutting the grass. You still dont have enough. So you start going to your neighbors house and asking if they need anything done. Eventually you earn just the right amount to buy the new game. Basically, if you want something set goals and accomplish them to earn what you want.

For my last reason why you can influence people in different ways is by being motivated. You cant influence others if your down. You have to try being inspiring and energetic. Because if others see you being motivated they would most likely do the same. Being motivated is important because it shows purpose of completing a goal. It also shows how hard you are willing to work to accomplish something.

some people may say that,a persons behavior is the best way to influence others because it sets the right mood on someone to be motivated. But on the other hand behavior doesnt show how a person can be influence to do something. Therefor the best way to influence people is by showing them your actions, goals, and being motivated.

First and foremost, why I disagree is because you can become better. For example, you mastered a project but you want it better then what you did before look at your project closely. Write on a piece of paper on what you have then plan out your other idea. Don't make it identical make it different. Show people that you can do it but twice as better. So you can be proud of yourself and people can be proud of you too.

Furthermore, why I disagree is because you should try it over and over again. For example, you mastered you project but you challenged yourself to do it twice as better. We all understand to do something better then what you already have can be a little complicated That's why you should try it over and over again so you can accomplish it. That can help a lot to be honest you can see where you made a mistakes and not commit it again.

Last but not least, why I disagree is because you should never bring yourself down. For example, people are getting so frustrated that they will say I can't no more I won't be able to do it. That's bringing yourself down you should remain calm. Don't fell pressured at the end of the day you will do it and you will feel really proud of all of the hard work you did.

In conclusion, the key to life is your attitude and the only person who can control it is you. Studies show that your attitude determines your success in life.

28639BE05BB7,"Music, drama, art class are considered as an elective class. Since such class will never be use in a daily basis in life. It's not required for you in order to graduate so to speak there is many more choices rather than music, drama, and art class to replace with it. It shouldn't be a required class for the student to take since everyone has a different mindset of what they want to be.

Something we use in our life that we learn from school is basic math to do our taxes and bills, but when will you ever use music, drama, or art in life, It's more like a hobby rather than a need in order to maintain a stable life. People don't care if you know how to write a song, act melodramatic, and how to draw Mona Lisa, applying for a job with such thing in your portfolio won't get you employed in most places. If you major in such things, only those of who are talented and skilled will only be able to have a successful life in such class. Electives are there for a reason, to have a starting point of what you want to be in the future, if it was turned to a required class, the world would have a second renaissance.

You don't need it in order to graduate. College wouldn't look into those as much as the prerequisite to your diploma or the major subject. Knowing how to paint or sculpt clay wouldn't be at the SAT that college look into if your'e eligible of going to their school or if they want you. As people grow up and go to college, their goals will change eventually. For example, you grow up and you want to be a doctor and half way through your college year you want to be a Scientist instead. You've covered some similar classes or lessons already since they are both major in science, but such classes like music, drama, or art class doesn't have any similarity when you changed your goal. They are a specific to themselves, they don't have a wide broad of category that shares with other subjects at all.

Learning and able to make music, be dramatic, and draw art might be a useful thing. Write songs for famous artist, act on plays and movies and even be recognize for your work in arts and make a lot of money from it. Only if you are successful, whether you are born with a talent or obsessed in such things and have one goal from the start. Only those of few will able to make a living out of it. It's not reliable career to as much as to be a requirement in school to be.

Only to be fixated in such subjects gives you less option of what you want to be,

it's not as needed in reality so that is why classes such as music, drama, and art be an elective. Students should not be required to take those classes since they will not have as much choice in what they want to be in their life.    ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5

Students may have electives classes and decide what to do and what they like for be more good in the school and have some attention on it.

Firstly they will like to go the school because they will feel like a little break of a hour on the class that they like for be chilling. They will not get frustrated or bored on the day of school and they will get off of stress for all of the day they will have s time just for do what they like to do .They will forget all of they work that have to be done because with other classes have homework, class work and the students will be feeling tired. And may be they will not want to come the school anymore.

Secondly students will be doing something that they enjoy because they will be happy to do something that entertained their minds and maybe they will be creative with a lot of things they will want to do in the class. It could be exited for them to have a class that they would like to have. Is good for their brains because the brain is going to work with more interested for be doing something that get all of their attention and they will be relaxing because they don't have to worry if they don't know how to do something because they like it and it will be that more easy to make.

Finally it could be an opportunity for them because students can fine their profession, what they want to be in the future. They may decided if they really like to be for example a an Artist or something else. They may be fine that they are more good they think they are. And maybe they do a big and good work and someone like it for example a professor and they will recommend to universities and thats how they can open new doors for the future of this new generation that it could be the best if will let them have electives classes .

Students can have electives classes because they can have a time for do what they really like it and is a right that students should have to be more interesting on school. ",3.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0
296B1DD1E251,"Do yo have a good impression? I am agree, the first impressions are almost impossible to change, because I feel that the first impression is important for everyone. There are many people that do not show how really are, and try that everyone love them, but at the end they show how really are and everybody move away. The first impression said everything about us. I believe that, If you show them everything about you, the people will love you how you are and they will trust on you.

Always we need to be honest with you and with the people. My ideology is be honest with yourself and do not show something that you do not are, If you want that everyone show you how really are.

I always show how I am friendly, lovely, funny, charismatic with everyone, and also try to help when someone need me with my knowledge and capacity. One of my experience is in my work, every single day new employees go to work in the store and I always help them to know how the store need to look like, and also with the customers I always smile, because I show my first impression with them, and I feel great when the customers saw me with a smile and they said: Hi, how are you today, it is good to see you and have a good one. I have few months working in the store, and I feel comfortable with everyone, because the customers do not know you enough, but they trust on you and they tell you something about his life, and with the rest of the employees we pass fun, We are like a family and we help us ourselves.

In the school is a little bit the different, because in the school I am shy, I do not talk with anyone just with my best friends, but I always show my emotions, enclose with the new people in the school, but sometimes they pretend be good at the first time, but with the pass of the time they have different attitude. That happen to me around 2 years ago with different person, the first person I knew her in 9 grade, when the both was new in the school, We became friends and everything we did together, but She change with the pass of the years, in summer another friend and his sister told us what she talk about me and my sister, but I always be honest with her and friendly and she showed me something different than the first time. Then, with another girl was a little bit the same, because she had jealous for my sister and I to had good grades and be active in the school the last year, but she always had bad grades, and We tried to help her but she never wanted, then with my sister and I move away from her because she was friendly with us but she was a bad friend with us.

I feel that we need to show always how We are not matter what everyone thing about us. Sometimes is good a new change in our lives, but never changing you essence. Something that I always do is think about my weakness and how can change it to a positive way

Finally, I think that We can be success in the life, the first impression will open many opportunities in the world, I know that the good person are these that show a good attitude when you know it the first time, and something in your heart told you that you knew a good person. Everyone will have present that they can trust in you and they will feel great to know a person like you. The first impression is always a good one. Many people do not know me and they think that I am conceited just how I look like and they do no take the time to talk with me or just smile me. My point of view is each person need to empathize with everyone know more people try to make new friend but always show like we are.         ",2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0
2A2AE5FB899F,"One topic that is frequently debated today is, if the amount of work days should change to less then five days to four with the idea of conserve energy and resources. Many people think the school should reduce the day of school. Some people believe that is a good idea to conserve this value and important resources. I think this idea will not make a good change because many student will be affected with this idea they work after school, we will have less time to do wherever we want, and it is difficult to everybody to stay focus ten hours in the school.

To being,

just imagine all the students how work after school, everyone have a limit in our body's and mind's to do different activities every single day. If for the students how they don't work after school it is really difficult to stay on time with they homework, think about the student's that only get home and just change their cloths, maybe eat something at home or just wait for a break in the work. A lot of students have to pay their own food, clothes, and even a lot of them pay rent. If the school finish at six, they will have less time to make money to live, that is one of the big situations that a lot of teenagers live every day. Now think about the increment of the time in the school and all the effects that will have.

Therefore, our second reason is we will have less time to do wherever we want or wherever we need to do. If the school finish at six only in one hour or more, the night come out. If you want to play soccer on the grass you can't because is to dark, a lot of stores close early, if you want to buy something you couldn't because probably the stores are closed at that time. when we got home our parents probably are not even there, many of them have to work on night. we only will have four hour's to do at less something that we want to do or we need to do starting from six to teen with the idea of that is the time to go to sleep.

However, it is difficult to stay focus ten hours in the school. More time in the school, more time of homework or even more classes to take. We will have even less time to do any activity after school, because we will not have enough time to finish our work. With all the material that we have to finish we being to stress out and not doing good in the school.

In conclusion, the amount of day at school is not necessary to change to less them five days and steel the same time, everyone get tired and sometime everyone only need a rest to continue day by day. We can fiend better ways to conserves this values resources, reduce the time of work and school will not make a big change. what about all the companies that only want to make money and they don't even care about the resources in our planet just keep doing money and destruction. sleep well if one of the most important needs of our body. If we have less time in the afternoon to do ,what we need to do we will not go to sleep early. We can't follow the same routine every single day, after school we can: play soccer, go to shopping, go to the movies. A lot of different activities that we can do, like one famous quote say "" It is more time,then life "" . We could do better with more time on our hands.               ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,4.0

All the confidence you build up was because of your own work. True self-esteem comes from achievement. Students and famous artist show us that without hard work, there is no true love for ones self.

First, school is the environment where students learn. In this building students especially show that in order to feel good and confident you work for it. For example; when playing a sport such as soccer, the athlete need to believe in itself to be an outstanding player and for his teammates to trust him when making a play. If the player does not believe in himself, his teammates will not chose him to guide them as the captain or simply as giving passes with the ball.

Continuing, a famous artists in the music industry named Lady Gaga show that when you believe in your passion and you give all of you in an scenery, the feeling of comfort and satisfaction is more than words. Gaga could not be where she is right now if people would have been sorry for her and just give her a contract without talent. In order to success you have to yourself and that's what she did, she develop her talent and now she is the most successful female artist in the music industry with ten gramys and many other recognition.

Contrary, some teachers agree that in order to build self-esteem students need to be commemorated for effort even if the work is not excellent but, why should students get recognition for not making their best effort? This would be unfair for all of the students that work hard for that test score. Feeling sorry for a student is not going to make them successful in life.

To conclude, all the hard work you put in a sport or your passion is going to help you succeed in life. Students are capable of so much and if a teacher praises an alumnus for work that its not worth a good grade, students will feel like they have not done something right and instead of building their self-esteem you would be creating an under qualify teacher or president.

disagree with Duke Ellington because a problem could cause depression,lack of sleep, feeling bad. The meaning of problems is a chance for you to do you best is that problems help you do better.

Have you ever been through depression? Problems are bad because kids or even teens cannot control them . Next you need to stay away from conflict because conflict is problem and problem can be bad. After that depression is when you cannot yourself and you do wearied things like forget to eat or go to school. Another thing is depression happens when you are hurt and want to quit life. Also if you in depression talk to a trusted adult and he or she will help you.

Problems can also leave you to have some or no sleep. First that happens because your thinking about the problem and how can I get raid of it. Also you can raid of it doing something that you love to do like listen to something watch TV or even read a book. After that if it's a bad problem you will need to talk with a trusted adult. Another thing is that whatever it happens gust be calm and try to sleep and forget about it. In addition to that dont use your phone when your in that type of a problem and dont use phone before bed because you will be dreaming about it all night. At last have faith in yourself and dont give up in life because you can get raid of the problem and live a happy life, but dont forget to do something you like when your in a problem.

Don't feel bad when your in a problem because you can do it. First thing dont let other make fun of you being in a problem and gust try your best and you got it. Also feeling bad and looking at others could cause a bigger problem gust do your own thing. After that feeling bad abut something is not good gust be positive and worry about your self and dont let any boss you or making fun of you. Next problems could be bad but you need to talk to someone that your going through that and why are going through that. Then you can not feel bad and you will know what to d when you have a problem and hoe to slove it too. At last avoid any danger problem as much as you can.

In, concliontion I have come up with that what Duke Ellington is agreeable because some are long term problem and some short term, but there bad for your health and mental health and for you safety. Also you need to stay away from and type of dangers because dangers is like problem so stay away.

2B62F285FD21,"Its a good idea to have year-round school because you will not be out of school long that will make you forget what was just learned and will always have help from teachers all the time.

Being out of school for a long time can make students forget what was just learned and it's true because many kids have reported that they forgot what they have learned in that year of school. Shorter breaks is the way to go because you will be able to retain the information that the teacher taught last week. This is another advantage that you will have because students will be fresh and will have more time to learn and study for upcoming test and would probably even make them a better student.

Having a long break is desireable by all of the students but it can also be a negative thing, Thats why having year-round school can improve many things for an example it can improve your grades, better focus and understanding, and better opportunities in life. It will even make the school at one of the best schools to go because the percentage of passing scores, quality of learning, and the best teachers.

This will not just improve and make students better at school but can also give them opportunities and chances in life. Education is the most valuable thing in the world without it this world would of not had influential leaders and inventors. This can open new doors in life and it can make anyones dream career come true not mattering their race or class. Having year- round school is the answers to many solutions.

I think Thomas Jefferson quote he wrote ""Determine never to be idle it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"" is right. I think that we accomplish more if we getting the work done faster working hard, and getting more people to always to work on it.

Getting the work done faster can help. if we are working all day faster and faster we might get tired but people could get more stuff done. If we are building a house and we work on it everyday but some people are just working slow as they can it can take them a year and two but if they were going to work and working faster and faster they could get more done and even get more house to work on. Some people might say that even if I'm working hard I still fail or just done accomplish of what I'm trying to get but if that happens to me I would work harder and faster so I don't fail and and I would accomplish what I'm trying to get.

If you are working hard and always working you are going to get what your trying to accomplish. Working hard mean actually doesn't mean you have to wake up in the morning a go work all you have to do is when you go to work work hard and work all your effort. Some people say that I don't have to work hard to get what I want well in my point is if its a long time goal why not make it short term goal and work hard and hard. If its a short term goal finish it in a day if you believe yourself.

Sometimes working alone can get boring and upsetting. I like to work with people that are happy and believe in there self, and they can get somewhere in there life. People like to work there friends that can distract them from what they are doing and they won't be able to focus on what they are doing. Even getting people to work can make everything easy and get the work done and get what you want to accomplish faster.

2C9EA803FF3A,"Success comes from failure and failure occurs when something doesn't happen.

As I think and based on my experience I am agree with the statement of Ralph Waldo Emerson, because when someone don't do anything they will never get to the success and can't achieve any skills, so its important to mastered and have skills in your life.

everyone should have skills in more than one because life is hard and without trying more it will become more harder.

As Emerson says:

""you will never grow""

it means that no succeed is possible without skills in different things.

If someone doesn't know anything without their profession in daily life, what do you think will it be easy for him to live like that?

Off course not, because life need everything and we will face hardships too and for being successful in our life we have to know everything and try everything beside that we have mastered.

For example:

someone has skills in engineering but they don't get any job and he want to start his personal business in which he doesn't have any skills, we know that it will be difficult for him to start because he doesn't know anything about business, so if he try and make a way for his business then he will get skills.

Our skills in more then one profession make us famous and shows our personality to other people and makes us more responsible in our life.

Getting mastered in more then one will make you famous and successful.

Life does not remain in one situation and life is going to change in every second.

Also humans are not same as well because everyone is getting older day by day so who knows what will happen next without Allah.

For example:

Everyone of us need to do different tasks and get our skills but beside that our life also need skills for our future generation and it is very important for every human being to have skills in their life because they have to show the right and wrong ways to their children.

If you are a skillful person then everyone will want to meet you because everyone need to know from the person who is mastered and you will become famous and fame is the way to success and without trying noting success is way too much hard.

Knowledge doesn't ends because it's like a sea and sea doesn't stop.

All of human beings needs to learn and they must learn.

knowledge is not just a book and a school that we do in daily life.

For example:

We can't achieve more skills from our books but we can be mastered if we try different from the book and try something new.

If we just try and learn from our books then it will be too much harder to achieve everything's skills from reading book beside reading we have to work and search for it and again trying is best option for success and growth.

We know that knowledge is more important then everything else but also without skill even knowledge is nothing.

If we don't have skills then we don't know how to use our knowledge and our skills comes from doing different tasks and without trying something different success is hard and growth of mind is impossible.

I am agree with Emerson and what does he says is based on his experience and if we think of those things then we can find the right answer.

As I mentioned life is hard and our life need more skills to go further and getting mastered in more then one profession will make us famous and successful in our further life and being famous and successful needs more hard work to try different from what we already know.

Work hard, be active and don't fear because time doesn't wait and our growth of mind and success comes from try different and hard in our life.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0

My opinion to what he is saving might mean that everyone has their own diddent way by accomplishing something on their paste some people maybe slow on what they do and get thing done that way and for some other people maybe the opposite they would know what they are doing and get thing done faster than other

When we do something and getting it done we do accomplished thingas way more faster the more we finish something the more greater feeling we get in with ourselves like being proud. but no that may not be true accomplishing something may be hand for some other people.

People that get thing done are ussually the people that want to succeed on their work, without slaking off. They would always stay on task and acomplished with what they got to do. For those people that don""t accomplish something on time usually maybe really busy with many things and things and not getting the other things finished.

h y schools shouldn't allow students to have and use cell phones for educational purposes? Although some say that schools should allow students to have and use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes, actually they shouldn't because students most of the time will be using their cell phones just to be in social media and also students probably will try to use their cell phones to cheat.

Those who believe that schools should allow students to have and use cell phones in classroom for educational purpose they have their reasons. They believe that it will be more easy for students to complete assignments and also it will help students to turn in their work on time.

In my opinion I think that schools shouldn't allow students to have and use cell phones in classroom for educational purposes because students most of the time will be using their cell phones just to be in social media. I think that because when I am in my Algebra 2 class my teacher always assign us to complete some work that we have in blackboard,but what I noticed in the last month was that most of my classmates that were around me they weren't doing the assignment instead some of them were just playing video games,watching videos in YouTube and using Snapchat.

I think that schools shouldn't allow students to have and use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose because students may use the cell phones to cheat. I believe that because such as a student if I was taking a test and I didn't study and I have the cell phone with me I will try to use it to find some answers in Google and also if students are allow to use the cell phones in the class they may use them to cheat by taking pictures of other student study guide,assignments and homework.

In conclusion schools shouldn't allow students to have and use cell phones for educational purpose because they will spend most of the time in social media and also they may use the cell phones for cheat.         ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0

First of all. I'll work hard to get the job and I'll do my best to understand the work that you all do. It may took some time, but it will be worth it. I am not a lazy worker, I am a fast leaner. I have done some other type of job, and I've done good because I don't just ask them to hire me, I ask them to hire me because I really want the job and work with them. However, sometimes people just don't like to hire people that doesn't have any experience with the job and they don't hire them or just ask them to leave, or they just tell them that they are not worth it to waste their time. Nowadays , people work where they can get accepted because other jobs would not accepted them and they do the to get at least the money to pay their rent and some other stuff. They don't think about what they are going to do if they keep working for hours and getting paid less, but if people would like to work for less hours and getting paid more, they would try to find a job where they can do their job for less hours and for more money. What I am trying to say is that I would like to be hire to this job, because I would work harder to be manager. I am qualify to this job even though I don't have any experience. Trying to work hard for a job is something that life teach you and could be worth it for me, and for my future. I could have a better life if I work harder, I would be prepare for any type of thing to do in this job. I may be ready for any type of things to do in this job.

Although, in may took some time to be able to work well, doing other type of job is kind of hard because people are used to work in different type of job and it is kind of hard because we cannot get used to work in this type of job in just one day and it is hard, but people could try, even me I would try to get used to this job and i will work hard enough to be manager. Even though, people may think that it is easy to do a job and get used to it fast, but it not true it is hard to get used to it to other job when you were doing other job. Some people are so cold heart and would not care about your feeling and would just try to make you quit the job and it is not right. If that happens to me I would not let it slide, because I would like to do my job in peace and with no interruption. It right for people to seek a better job position, even though if you are starting to do it, but it is normal for people to seek a better position: just like me a seek for better position in the job. However people would not let you in peace, they would try to make you quit, but if you don't let them be like that to you they would get tired of doing that to you and they would see how much you are getting better and with a better position. I would love to see people that hate me to see me grow in the job that I would do if they hire me, I am not going to be a lazy guy in the job I would work harder to get to manager and later on I would do more and so much more to be an owner of my own business. Who wouldn't want to be an owner of their own business, everyone does want to be and want to have it, just like me everyone have had a dream of owning a business but after all that start you have to work harder to get it. that what I would do in this job. Eventually, I would understand the stuff of the job and I would do them and be much better then the others.

Finally, doing a job that you have no experience, but you are a good candidate, that means your are capable of doing so much more and be a better worker or even be your own boss. You only have to work hard enough to get it and to achieved your goal, it doesn't matter if it take one or three years, you have to keep going until you achieved your goal and try to work hard to achieved that goal. I would do all that to achieved my goal, it doesn't matter if it take me two or three years; I would do my best to do it. I would take the risk and do it better than anyone else in this job, or other type of job, Learning different things can make you know more and more qualify to do other type of work. knowing more stuff about other type of jobs, it make you more qualify to do more and to be able to work in more stuff or even to owne your own business.

30DDC17D2986,"First impressions are very important but could they be changed?. Yes, yes they could be changed because first impressions don't justify who you are as a person and some people don't act the same when you first meet them. However some people are really judgmental about first impressions and could block off any type of relationship they had with you being job related, maybe girlfriend or boyfriend, and friends.

First impressions are serious which drives a lot of people insane. Because they don't know how the people are going to react to them but, its okay that doesn't define who you are as a person. A great tip of advice is being able to read a room that means how people are acting in certain time and place. Like whats the vibe and mood if you should be more relaxed, goofy,serious etc. If you can read a room first impressions will become a lot easier because you will know how to act.

But that's not the only way to have a good first impression most people dont act the same say on the first date,its probably going to be awkward and silent because you dont know how to act verses seeing someone for the 5th time. You know what to say, you know how to have an okay conversation. But dates arent the only situations that first impressions fall into. Jobs, jobs are the biggest make or break for first impressions from experience you can't be nervous and just be real you dont have to act differently. If your job takes you for what you have then its a great job.

However first impressions are very very judgmental. Some people take first impressions over anything because its the first glimpse they have of you and how you act as a person. And if they dont like you won't give you a job or another date depending on the situation. And there is nothing you can do about it. not even getting the chance to change the first impression.

327EB11122D0,"Hello mi name is Generic_Name and my prompt is about ''Failure'' and ''Success.''

What i think about this?

The failure is a feeling so bad, when you have a bad day or something was wrong,your feel the person most useless. Yes, I agree with Churchill statement, because he have all the reason. Each person failure has a recompense and all the good what you do make and God give to you multiply.

We all have success why?,because everybody work so hard and they wish make all your dreams. In the personal, i think all start since down, when you everyday work hard your successful is each day more big and blessed,I have three reasons why i agree with this prompt.

My first reason:

Never say ''I can't'' because when you have a purpose you have to make,maybe many persons tell you ''forget it,you never can't this possible'' but you have to know when something is realize with the heart all is possible in this life never forget it.

My second reason:

Always you listen when somebody tell you something,because his advice can help you in the future and you can use the same advice for help other persons too. You need to be better every day for make a present and future so much better and be able to get what you wish.

My third reason:

If you not believe in who are you, you are in a big problem, the unique person can say what you can do or you can't not are you nobody else. In your life you have friends,teachers and you family is the most important in the world the people believe in you. Follow you dreams,follow you future, and always smile and when something was wrong, not feel bad,of course when you have a error you can learn and be a best person each day.

What is my point of view on this?

The life is so hard and beautiful,you can be wherever you want,follow you way and never stop,make the difference and never stop of dream. Be a nice person and do not even threat bad other people. Therefore, you never hands down when you see the past and now the present you can see what long you are, stay strong,be intelligent not lying and always say the true. When passed the time you can see all effort you dedicated,all is possible.

Detail Support:

My detail support is about the immigrant, this is a good example for this prompt,they came to United State for a better life,is very difficult and danger,because sometimes many persons died or have problems in the way, how much time is? honestly i dont know sometimes is one week,two weeks or more than of one month. When they finally here in United State is a new beginning is a new life,of course is so complicated and so sad,because is a new country and new culture y the most important the language is different.

The principal thing is learn talk, and writing in English. After this if you have your permission of work,you can star working in a restaurant o something you can learn fast and easy or if you are minor of age you need go to middle school or high school dependent what age do you have for after you can graduated. and attain a best work. This is so hard but not impossible,maybe you have many days bad,and you cry so much,but each sacrificed has its pay back.

327F4BCC9E4B,"The idea that businesses have made is very important. Finding means to conserve energy and resources are important in our daily life. Most people use energy and resources in their day to day activities which put more pressure on the use of energy and resources. This four-day work week will conserve the workload on energy and resources. I agree to the fact that my school should follow the four-day school week with each day consisting of ten hours.

When the school time is extended, it will make students have more time to do any unfinished assignments in a particular class. Students can do more work and cover many topics in a day. This will make teachers do a lot of work in a day. For instance, any project that you didnot finish can be done the next day in class, students will have enough time to ask questions about what they are being taught, they will have sufficient time to go to teachers and practice more if they have other questions related to what they were taught. This will make classes fun and more entertaining. Students will have adequate time to study and understand the concept of what they are being taught in class.

If this adaptation is considered in my school, it will cut down the usage of energy and resources. The school uses more energy and resources due to the population of the students. Some examples of such equipment that uses higher energy are as follows : Air Condition, Laptops, Printers and many others. These machines uses high barometric pressure. Throughout this four-day school week, we can conserve the energy we waste in the school.

Others may say students might get bored due to the increase in hours because they are used to the normal daily routine but hasn't considered the benefits of it. When this is taken into consideration, more energy and resources can be kept from wastage.

In summary, the four-day routine and extending of time will be beneficial to conserving energy and resources in the shool. This will make students work hard in class, reduce the work load on energy and resources, seek more help from teachers if they are finding difficulties in a particular class.

331103D7D5CF,"""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing, "" said by the philosopher, physician, and humanitarian Albert Schweitzer. Giving a good example by your own experience might influence other people; it depends on the situation. In my opinion, giving a good example is not the only thing to influence people as said in the quote, but there are things other than setting a good examples that influence people. For example, if someone had experience in playing basketball, and another guy was a beginner, it will be helpful if the experienced one helps him and shows him how to play by training him, but if the experienced one tells the begginner person an example of how to shoot the ball but not by showing him, it wouldn't be helpful to him and won't influence him.

One of the reasons i think that example might not be helpful is because when time moves on, the way that things work changes. Some people when they set a good example to influence someone that need motivation, they set an example from their own experience that might be some years ago, That can create a problem. For example, if a computer science major who graduated 10 years ago, and another one who just started college to study computer science and have some obstacles, if the major gave examples to the other guy about what he did in college 10 years ago to influence him, it would be a problem because as time goes we humans move forward in technology and we develop the education, so if the major gave the other guy his own experience it would be different than college now. This example won't help the guy who just started college, but it would be better if the major showed him the way to study and try to explain to him things.

Sometimes people understand examples wrongly and influence others in an incorrect way, and it can be a big problem, It can turn motivation into failure. For example, there was a famous quote saying that failing many times without loss of enthusiasm leads to success, if someone study medicine in college and then he found himself failing tests and projects, but he took this quote as his influencer and he didn't lose enthusiasm, maybe after a while when he find himself still getting the same grades, he will lose enthusiasm and he will give up. The problem here is that he misunderstood the quote, the quote meant that he shouldn't loss enthusiasm even if he fail many times, but he thought that after failing two or three times he will do more better.

Some people may argue that setting a good example by your own behavior is the only and best way to influence other people, because they think that if people follow the examples of the experienced people, they will succeed and will be motivated to do more work. For example, if someone successful gave an example of how he became successful, and what obstacles did stop him, and how did he get through them, Maybe some teenager listen to him and become influenced, and then he work hard to become like the successful guy. Or maybe someone who failed in something listen to the successful guy and learn how did he get through the things that stopped him, and then he become motivated to be successful and he work hard to reach his goal.

In conclusion, influencing others by your own experience might be helpful to some people, but also it can become a problem and not helpful to alot of people. Furthermor, using examples from your own behavior is not the only way to influence others, thats why i disagree with the quote, because examples could be perfect, but it is not the best or the only way. There are other ways as i mentioned, that could turn people's lifes from failure to success.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5

34A066E69905,"There are two types of working. one of them is workinng with a group, another one is working individually. Although some people prefer to work alone. I belive it is so much better to work in a group. If we compare these two working types, the benefits of group work are more then those working alone.

Firstly, I prefer to work in a group because group work allow a person to work according to his or her strength, since the the group members apply their strong side to the work, the completion time will be faster. For instance, I was involve in a car desgin project several years ago. one person made engineering calculation to understand which parts are critical for our design, I made the drawings of the car components, and another friend of mine made the presentation for our project, then he present it to the teacher, He gave us a good respond and additional points since we completed our work before the due date. to be more precise, we did a great job, because we devided the work according to our strong sides.

Another reason why I prefer to work an a group is that I think that this type of work establishes a stonger relationship between the group members. As humans, sociallzation it important for us and working with a group give us a chance to improve our relationship. when people are in a group, they have to communicate with each other at each step of the process. for example, in our last year elective course, I made new friends becaude we were involved in a group project together. Thankds to the project, we did build a great relationship among each other, and we are still in touch.

lastly, group work improves the sense of responsibility. All group members are aware that their perperformance effects the group, so all group members try to do their best and work hard to get better results. For example, A few years ago, some of my friends and I participated in a competition which was related to optimization. since there was a lot of thing to do, we devide the topics among each other. we did not have enough information about one of the shared parts. however, a person who got that subject made a lot of effort to learn the topic well. He attended online course and read books related to that field. Eventualy, he accomplished it and did a great job. what I'm trying to say is that in a group work, even if a person does not have enought information related to his or her working area, he or she may learn things with his or her effort becuse he or she knows that a miskake will cause negative outcomes.

In conclusion, working with a gruop makes things more easier and helps make the group member work more happily. If we take the info account to all these factors, we may reach the conclousion that working in a group has more advantages than working alone.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

I like going to parks because i get to ride my BMX bike around with my friends. some adults go to parks to exercise, others like kids get to play and have fun by swinging or playing on the slides.

Some kids go outside in front of their house and play other games like hopscotch, jump rope, or like other people they can do other activities outside and ride bikes around or go to a skate park. there are endless amounts of activities for people to do outside, playing on the swings at the park can be fun because when i go there i like to see who can go the highest and sometimes i just do it for fun when im bored

People that like to find and inspect bugs can go at the park, the park has lots of bugs including butterflies, ladybugs, caterpillar, and fireflies. some people find bugs interesting for some reason. theres also a park called a dog park. but you would normally see kids having fun, Other people at the park like to play tag, tag is a very fun game and i think that kids would have fun playing it, hide and seek is also an option. theres no point of going to the park if you can't have any fun. My favorite thing to do at the park is play on the swings, when i get bored i start to ride my BMX bike around my neighborhood. Spending time outdoors is good for you.

352F0193E251,"Dear Generic_Name,

Would you rather work with friends who are going to keep you distracted from off topic conversations ? In my opinion, it would be better to work alone so that you can focus on your work. In my science class, we always get the opportunity to work with partners. But i rather work alone and if I need help or don't understand something I can always ask my teacher. If you work alone you have a better chance of learning more and passing your final exam. Its good to work with partners sometimes.

Although, you have a better chance of passing your class. You also get the chance to get good skills. Like to not depend on anybody for help, to be a leader not a follower.

Before my uncle passed away, he told me to never depend on nobody for help. You have to climb the steps by yourself to get to where you want to be. I want to own a mechanic shop by myself when i am older. Ill work on all the cars by myself with no employees. You can learn a lot of skills by working alone.

Everybody has different opinions,some people say working with partners may be easier and helpful. But you have to think about all the distractions and trouble making kids. Letting other students do all the work and then copying and take credit for someone else work. I use to be one of those kids until i noticed I am never going to learn or get somewhere in my life if I keep letting people carry me over my steps.

To conclude,working with partners may be easier,faster and exciting. Working alone is a mans job,to not be a follower. To not let anybody else do their work or to carry them over your steps.",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5
367781F47105,"Most students in high school who would be looking forward to attend college barely have enough time to even get a part time job. They would work as hard as they could for a better and brighter future. For that specific reason,committing a career by the time they enter high school would be a bad idea for the students. They would need more knowledges,they would be too young to to decide,and that could also ruin their dreams. Students should not commit a career by the time they enter high school because they would not benefit from it.

firstly to begin with,lack of knowledges could not only destroy their dreams,but also them. They would not have enough experience. Everything would be confusing for them because they didn't have a chance to learn them back in high school. One thing for sure,they wouldn't be good at it as well as they would be if they finished high school and attended college. Also,they wouldn't be as open as they should be.

Secondly another,being young and have to decide something that is going to be a big part of their future is the hardest decision. They might regret it in the future. There is a fifty percent chance that they'd change their mind when they grow up. When they are young,scared,and have pressure on them they usually make the worst decision,but later in life when they would finally realize it. It'll be too late to fix it. They also would even blame their parents in some kind of way.

Also,that one decision can ruin their life and dreams completely. They wouldn't even be interested in going to college. They might drop out high school when they would start recieving checks because they need money and they get it at least every week,""so what's the point of going to college"",they would think. They would also need more time to think and decide what they really want before choosing something they might regret.

In conclusion,not only high school students,but every other kids in general have the right to have enough time to decide what they want when they feel ready to. They need to finish high school,go to college,and have a chance to choose what they want to be. When they don't have enough experience they are usually shy and scared when doing something because they don't know what they are doing. When this happen,the kid can blame whoever he or she wants because his or her parents and the school guidance should have sat down with this kid and tell the kid all about high school,college,career,and better future because that's what they are here for.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5

Some societies say yes, by the time they get to high school they will be given courses to guide them toward the career they have chosen. With the students given the classes needed by the guidance teacher, It will get them a well paying job right after graduating because they will already have the classes needed for that job. If they plan on going to collage to become a scientist they will offer you classes for free and you won't have to pay for those classes in collage. By having students identify a career by the time they enter high school seems to me like a great idea. once they know what there career is going to be they can take the classes required for that job.

Once the student has identified the career that he or she desires, the guidance teacher will step in and set up the classes that you'll need to take for the career that you've chosen. when I first entered high school the guidance teacher pulled everyone out of class to ask us what our career was going to be. I remember telling her that I wanted to become a carpenter, she said""great choice we actually have another school that you can go for the second half of school"". I told her that seems great, she also put me some math classes because in carpentry you use math to measure. That was how the guidance teacher helped me achieve the career that I wanted by helping me get the classes that I needed to become a carpenter.

By committing to a career at a young age actually helps the students succeed in life. How does it help the student succeed? It helps the students get a good job by the time they are out of high school, by giving him the classes required for the career he wants. For example some of the students that didn't commit to a career when they where in high school are now working in a low paying job. Some are even in a lot of debt paying for the classes needed for the career they want while they could of got some classes for free in high school. One of my cousins went to high school and every year the guidance teacher would ask him what he wanted his career to be. He would always say I don't know yet, time went by and when he finally found what he wanted his career to be it was to late. My cousin is now in big debt with the bank trying to pay for his classes that he needs for his engineering job.

If one of the students decides he wants to become a scientist when he grows up. The guidance teacher will give him the classes needed like Biology and science classes. Once he gets into collage he will already have some of the classes required to become a scientist. He will only have to pay for the classes that are not provided in school. My uncles daughter is studying to become a teacher, when my cousin was in ninth grade she told the guidance teacher that she wanted to become a teacher. She was given some of the classes that are required to become a teacher but they told her that she would have to go to collage but they would give her all the classes that they could offer so she wouldn't have to pay as much when she went to collage to become a teacher.

Other people argue that a students should not commit to a career at a young age because they don't know about all the careers that are out in the world. They could chose one and latter change there minds into anther career. The is a good chance that all the students who chose the career they wanted ends up being the job that they have in the future. With having the students to commit to a career at a young age is good because they will be given the classes they need in order to be successful in the career that they've chosen.

Former British prime minister Winston Churchill once said ''success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. you learn from your mistakes every time you fail in your live. you keep trying hard till you achieve what you want and studied hard for in life. failure leads to success and it is important for everyone to fail in life, failure plays an important role in our daily lives. failing does not always mean it is the end of the world you have chances in life to keep trying hard . everyone has always an experience of failure in life nobody every succeeded without failing in their lives.

First when you fail sometimes you get disappointed and say am never going to succeed in life but when you see the mistake you did the first time you try hard until you pass it. for example last year i failed my world history exam i was so disappointed that i did not want to retake again but our teacher gave me the paper back to see what i did wrong i saw that i did not read the question.

from that day on i began reading my questions and i got the highest grade in class. i learned i should always read my questions before answering because if i do not read i will fail again and i did not want to retake the test again, when i read the question and i finally began to understand the question. i learned that i should always read my questions even if am in a hurry to go and it does not matter the situation reading a question is important. i learned that guessing is not good sometimes it results in failing, i should study the night before a test.

Second a person should always learn how to study hard on everything you are given even if it is hard just try your best. last year when i gave my mum my world history final exam results she told me that i should try hard and she knows i can pass the test i told her that i will but am scared to take it again. my mum made sure that i studies every day and one day when i stayed after school for extra help. i also achieved passing this world history by trying my best to understand what the question is asking . paying attention in class also made me pass not only the final exam but also the class.

when i passed this exam i was so excited because i studied hard to get at least a eighty nine on the final exam and i was also passing the class and i was understanding my work i was also on top of my assignments.

Third failing something you took for the first time is not a bad thing it tell you that you need to keep working hard. for example one day i came back home crying and my mum asked what was wrong and i told her am still failing the world history exam. she told me that failing does not make me dumb it simply tells me that i need to correct my mistakes. she also told me that as a kid she also was failing her classes but she tried hard and hard and she now is very successful at wok. i also asked her how can i be successful? she told me that keep trying your best even if it is not your best accomplishment. she also told me that she would always be proud of me because she sees me working hard and trying to do my best. when i finally studied a lot and re-took the same test and passed it i was very proud of myself and said failure always leads to success.

however, some people may say that failure does not play a big role in your life because there are other ways to suceed. you will always suceed anything in life withour failing, you do not need to work hard for what you want and you can always achieve everything as long as you do it. but they are wrong because failure is always the number one thing that leads people to sucess. failing leads you to try hard in life you learn from your mistakes. when you fail it does not mean it is the end of the world. you keep trying hard till you achieve what you want and studied hard for in life. failure leads to success and it is important for everyone to fail in life, failure plays an important role in our daily lives.",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5
387857083AAE,"I agree with Albert Schweitzer, because he's a man with a lot's of experience and influence.

Let's say he is wrong and my behavior is not the best way to influence other people, and maybe people only care about famous people and look up to them and get influenced by their behavior.

Some people may agree with that statement, I just feel like it's not completely true.

For example, let's say I was very unknown by a lot's of people and they see me saving a kitten of the road.

Will people be influenced by my behavior? even thought they don't know me, would they agree with my choice in saving the kitten? or will they follow someone who's famous?.

Albert Schweitzer said, ""example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" What he is saying is that no matter how famous or how infamous you are, everyone will follow someones example no matter what the conditions my be, at the end someone will follow your behavior because they are influenced.

This is why the quote that says ""first impression is the last impression"" because no boss is going to hire someone who's: show's up to work late or nor properly dressed or doesn't look serous to take the job.

The conclusion of this statement is, that everyone is influenced by someone's example and it doesn't matter who the person may even be.

At the end I personally still agree with what Albert Schweitzer said and I can not find a better statement or an argument that people may not know the right answer to.

Everyone has to have some kinda example to look up to or look down on based on their behavior or actions.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5
38DF7BD353A9,"Its a good idea for student to try to finish high school early so they can start there grown up life.

when you finish school early you can start going into the work force earlier. Start working as early as you can so you can save up money for your life. you have more time to thick if you want to go to college.

Start thinking more about your self you have time to do what you want to and not having to worry about school. Go travel the world visit family and friends, you only live once so why not finish high school in 3 years. You dont need to get up early to go to school anymore,dont have to worry about homework and tests. You dont have to miss out on anything anymore youll have lots of free time.

your parent wont have to worry about spending money on you school supplies. your parent wont be on you ass much when your done with school like are you done with your homework, classwork how are your grades. no need for you to eat threat nasty school food for other year. you wont have to walk up trying to not miss the bus in the morning.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5
394F5867B7EC,"Working alone is great but have you ever thought about the benefits of working in groups? for example, when you are working with a group of people it it easier to get ideas; for example,you can all put your thoughts tougher and find out the resolution. Also working with a group makes it faster to finish the tasks; some people take longer than others so its good to have people around to help.

Most people believe that working alone is better but working in a group is more beneficial for example,if there is a problem that needs to be solved it is easier to solve it because there are more people to figure out the problem and to give their opinions; which will help throughout the way. In other words, if one of the group members has trouble with the assignment another group member could help them out;instead of figuring it out by themselves.

Working in groups could also make assignments become complete faster for example,some students while working alone take a long time and end up having to take their assignments home for homework; while in a group they can come up with a solution together and get it complete. It will also benefit the teacher because there won't be any late papers.

There are benefits of working in a group but there are also benefits of working by yourself for example,sometimes it gets loud in the group and it will be hard for them to focus and get their work done also some students like to mess around and play fight instead of getting there work done. Even tho working in groups could cause a lot of talking and play fighting , it is still a more beneficial way for students.

In conclusion, working alone is a better way for students to show what they know but working in groups is more helpful for students who are struggling. It has been listed on google that Researchers have proven that it is a more helpful way to learn.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0
39B3FC0EAE2A,"Imagine being a loner for the rest of your life because you only relied on yourself. This quote says "" think about the benefits working with a group or working alone."" Working alone helps you complete what is task to you with no distractions, and creates an important skill to be independent. Working in a group helps with your commutation skills, and each person has their own role to play in a group, so it's less stressful. Although, working alone is more beneficial, actually, working with a group is best beneficial.

Those who believe, working alone is more beneficial have a point because you don't need to relay on anyone. You have more control on what you're working on, these are also your own ideas not anyone else. Working alone keeps you concentrated on what you are working on. For an example when you're working alone it's less likely to get distracting by someone. Working alone can develop independent skill, this skill is good to have in the future. In reality no one is there to hold your hand and guide you. The benefits working alone are completing your own work with your own reasons and less distractions.

However, the benefits on working with a group helps to get the job done faster. Listening to what others say is great listening skills; people like when you listen to them. In a group you can combine ideas and relay on each other. For an example you're confuse you have your group to explain to you what you need to do. This benefits your commutations skills and willing to speak up when you don't understand something. There is nothing wrong with reaching out for help, it shows you want a better understanding on the topic. Working in a group also has an advantage in speeding up the possess since each person is working on what they're assign to. Everyone has their weaknesses and strengths, the goal is to find what best fits for everyone in your group, so you work together as a team. If you make a mistake you have your group to give you feedback on what you should work on.

Additionally, working in a group can reduce stress because you're only focus on one part on what you're working on. We know projects, assignments, etc..can be really stressful, all you have in mind is "" I have to finish all this.""

Working in a group isn't so stressful because everyone has their own role they're working on. Everyone relays on each other to finish their own part, so they can finish faster.

In conclusion, working with a group is best beneficial because you finish your work faster and its less stressful than working by yourself. You can learn new things by working with others, also it increases your communication skills. You can also help one another by focusing on their weaknesses and giving feedback. Therefore, this is an important experience to have because in the future you'll have to learn to work with one another at any job you apply to. ",3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5
39E0A362CF29,"The Generation of today they all want success instead of failure,for success to occur we have to fight for it,success does not come by itself every single human have to built,A success live without losing the enthusiasm,but the problem of today, is that people usually likes to give up things. Although, some say that success does not consist of going from failure to failure actually, it does consist of going from failure to failure,one reason is,because we are getting stronger. At some point we fail in something,for my own perspective it is like a new opportunity for us,so we can learn from our mistake. In general all the people at some point can commit an error,but the problem here is not the mistake committed, the problem is that people start losing the willing to learn,and willing to be better. there is not even one perfect human, who does not fail in anything. Another reason is because you can meet your level. It is really important for us to know our capacity. I am sure that our brain is not limited we put limit in our lives we all have the ability to get things done, it doesn't matter the situation or the problem. There always have been solutions for every single situation,for all the people who does not give up.

Those who believe, that success does not consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm have their reasons. They believe that failure does not give a good outcome to be re joy of;They seem failure like a pain hurting people making them feel really bad, and it makes them not to keep trying. They also think that failure make them doubt themselves,and that is not true my argument is not to give up so easily. They have to try until they get it done,and clearly,but nevertheless they regret it.

In my point of view, I believe that when failure occur we get stronger. An example of this would be my friend Generic_Name: 20 years old, a white man,black eyes, and black hair. He wanted to go to college, to study electricity, but his finance was slow,so decided to learn it without going to college. I knew right away that he will be challenged to make his way thought,so he start practicing looking tutorials, how to fix things, how to change a lamp, all that kind of stuff,but my surprise was when the time pass he apply for a electricity company. I said to him

! are you serious ! don't tell me that you already know electricity. He got a moment of silence... and respond yes, i make my own way he start explaining me all the difficulties part that he was on. He said that at some point he wanted to just forget that,but something inside of him wanted to keep trying. Of course the people were saying no you cant do it in a funny way,but he did not listened to the people. Moreover he wanted to keep going. He knew that it was something hard to become an electrician,but not impossible. Today Generic_Name is a really good electrician. He did not only learned electricity. He also learned how to paint houses. This is a proof that we cannot give things up only because it seem hard. It is not based on your finance. Some people have a low economy,but still there is not wall that can stop the willing to do something. It only required a personal character and volunteer. What might happened if Generic_Name loss the enthusiasm he probably will be putting less importance on him.

I also think that when failure occur frequently, we will know and meet our level our own capacity, like what are we made of. A prove of this can be my sister in law. She was on high school senior year. She had some problem in her algebra 2 class at the beginning she did not understood anything. She was in every single class,but the problem was that her grades in algebra were critical,so she talked with her boyfriend Generic_Name which is my brother. She was saying that she did not wanted to go to her algebra 2 class. Not anymore,because it was too hard she feel less intelligent and she wanted not to keep trying. My brother respond, I think that you are just starting in the way that you have not try like I would like you to try, if you doubt yourself that is a problem,because I can see a really smart person right in front of me. Believe in yourself and try again after that, she decided to give everything or nothing, so she was studying really hard, asking a lot of questions to the teacher, with that hunger to learn, and be the best in her Algebra class. Even though her classmates were ironic. Her eyes were not on them. In addition she learned a lot at the beginning she was below of her classmates, more often she was the Hornet in her class with a reward for trying super hard, and get things done on time. Image what might occurred if my sister in law give up, so easily of course she will fail the class in all quarters and have that tone of loser on her.

In conclusion, when failure comes don't let it the opportunity to take over you,because you will be thinking of yourself bad things. If you are having hard times and you can't see things clear, just ask these question to yourself Do i am doing enough for it or i am just starting?. every single of us have a big ability there no exceptions. there is people who really know what they want,and fight for it and there is people who easily give things up. We should be those kind of people who does not look for their goals and dream who are sitting down expecting how other people naturally reach to their dreams.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
39F578D9212E,"An enjoyable place where you can go spend time outdoors is going to the beach because you get to do a lot of stuff. For example, you can get to spend time with your family and have fun with them or with your friends. You may be thinking that the beach is somewhere where you can go and come back that same day but what you don't know is that you can go to a hotel and enjoy the hotel and the pool. You can go eat anywhere you want there is a lot of options you can choice from. There is a lot of fun things you can do for example you can go to the haunted house, the carnival, and the art work they have so you can take pictures with your family or other members. The beach is a place where you can go to relax and get sun tan and go swimming.

The reason why you should go to the beach is because you need to have some fun time and not be stress about a lot of things in your life and enjoy the times you have with your family and capture memories with them. One of the most importance part of going is to be able to not be bored at home and do nothing. The beach is a place where you can walk around and see things you haven't seen and also taking pictures of where you have been. You can go to restaurants or you can bring food of your own. You could be able to meet new people you haven't meet before. There is a lot of clubs at the beach you can go there and dance and have some drinks. You could go to the store and buy clothes,hats,sun glasses, and more.

The second reason why you should go is because they have good hotels you can stay in and you would want to pick a hotel that is right next to the beach so you could see a good view of it. There are these bikes you could ride with your whole family and you would all be able to piddle on it or you could bring your own bike or any other stuff you might want to ride. The waves of the beach is cold but it is worth it because the waves are really big and can push you really hard but that depends if you could swim. You could also go to the pool that is in the hotel and be there if you don't want to go to the beach. Sometimes, people would want to be at the beach and stay at the hotel for like two weeks or more but I consider you being there for like about four weeks because you would be eligible to discover new things or see new things.

The last reason would be go when it's 4th of July because when they have fireworks at the beach it looks really pretty and nice. The beach is a place where people could get married or have a romantic time there and they enjoy doing that. There are people that do there shows there like to get money for doing stuff for living. I would want to actually live at the beach because I don't need to go from where I live to the beach because it's really far away but anyways, at the beach there is a lot of great stuff there and nice people and I know for a fact that you should diffidently consider going and not over thinking it.

In conclusion, I recommend you going because you are going to have a lot of fun especially with your friends and family and you would remember that in your spending time outdoors you had a good time. Don't forget the hotels,the food, and the pool are such amazing part of why you should go to the beach.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0
3A2DBB1E0556,"I believe that my skill is I can speak another language,Korean, fluently. Speaking another language is not effortless but the effort give pleasure that I can help other people. It is tired and hard to help other people, but assist make people glad. My ability is I can speak Korean, acquired Korean by reading the books, can use my skill usefully by teaching Korean to Korean - American and communicate and help Korean.

I developed my Korean skill by reading books often. I read a Korean book at least in a week. Mostly, it was hard to understand and I had to find the words meaning in every single time. However, I could improve my writing skills,

vocabulary skill and I could speak Korean and write logically. For example, I took World Language Exam last year, I could use the words that I saw when I was reading a book. Also, I could make my writing clearly, organize and I understood prompt very well. In addition, my parents read Korean books to me and my brother. That made me to understand and speak in Korean fluently.

I can use Korean skill very usefully by teaching Korean to Korean- American. Usually, people who were born in America but their families are Korean, and they don't know how to write, speak and write in Korean. For example, I go to the church every Saturday and help to teach Korean to the teenagers or children. It is hard but they can learn Korean from Korean school and communicate with families. For example, they become teenagers, and they can speak only English and their parents can speak only Korean. They will not able to communicate each other. They will become farther. Nevertheless, teenagers can ignore their parents that they cannot speak English.

Communicate with Korean can be useful because some Korean are immigrated to America with not enough English skills. They need help with bills, housing and information of America. If you go any stores or community center, they are having difficult because they can't speak English so they cannot understand what the owner is trying to say. If you can speak Korean, you can help them. For example, I was student ambassador which is help new students to touring the school and help them with the schedule. The new student came to our school and she was Korean and she cannot speak English. I introduce the school, and class schedule in Korean to her so she can understand about school system.

There are lots of advantages if you speak another languages. You can acquire Korean by reading books that help to improve your writing, reading, vocabulary skills. Also,teaching Korean to children or teenagers and can communicate with Korean can help people. ",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.5

If your school extend school day for two hours there are some thing you can't do. You can't play after school games. You can't do your homework. You have less time to work. You going home late. You can't fresh your mind.

Reason one, students who work after school they have moer time on work. For example, if your working time is four o'clock to ten o'clock. If you work regular time you going to make more money. Students need to work becaus they needs to pay the cell phome bills or on gasolin.

Reason two, students who want to play after school game they can play the game. If they don't have time to play after school game they can't fresh there mind. For example, students who live one or two hours away for school they have time to play after school game.

Reason three, students can fresh there mind. Students can't fresh there mind because they are studying more then they need. For example, some time students can't remember what they learn in class, but can do other thinks. Some time student haveing so much fun in the class. Because there mind is so much fresh.

That why school can't extend the school day for two hours. Students can get tired in ten hours of study. Students can't fresh there mind. They can't play after school game.

For example if there's a project to be due, then that project must be due, and if the teacher gives you a due date it would be more motivating to finish it on time then later or even late. As long as the person doesn't give up and keep focus, then there's nothing to worry about. Staying on task isn't that hard, but if there's any distractions you must remove yourself from that situation and get back on track. Like imagine if a student was in class having trouble focusing because the students around them we're distracting or noisy. Then they may ask the teacher that they prefer working in the hall because the noise in the class is to distracting to them. The key is when it comes to doing something you must keep busy to reach that goal of finishing or being done.

Although some might agruenming that graduate in three is bad ideas actually graduate three is good ideas because be more mature for real world and you are able take full responsible of their own.

First reason is graduate three is good idea because be more mature for real world. Many people today they does know how real world work.

for example, many teenage does not know how real world work; teen drink and drive involve themselves in accident they hurt themselves and other people without think about their action because their parent bail them out of problem so they don't care if hurt some one are not.

All they know some has take care them. This shows that if teenage graduate three year they will be more mature for real world and they learning their lesson what to do and not what to do.

Another example,

is parent take teenage their full reasonable like pay for car insurance if brake the law parents stand for them say my child is innocent because parents defends for them if do some wrong convinces themselves they do right thing so be to late for them they think that way real world world work they wound't able to learned from their mistake. This show that teenage graduate three year help them to know their surrounding know full action they take full responsible own act.

Second reason is good ideas teenage graduate because it full rsponable of their own they will pay house rent and bills, light bill for example,

my mom pay for phone bill so real they care where money come all know is pay for bill. this shows teen will be more rsponable if pay the own bill be care bill not to go up. Another example I use to much light and water so when water and light bill come will go up ; my mom is only one that has pay bill.

this shows that if teenage doesn't how much they use water and light bill because their take care of those things for them.

Other some side might argument that graduate in three is bad ideas because you miss out life you don't know to have fun you will be stress out you know what make you happy. other example is on enjoy the moment you have as teenage.

At the end graduate three is good ideas because be more mature for real world and you are able take full responsible of their own you will know what life lay out you out their. ",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0

I mean I see why people would choose that for an example say if your late to class. You won't be because your taking online classes and you have so much time to get ready. When you have school you have less time to get ready even to have breakfast.

If your feeling sick for the people that take online classes it's much easier for them because that can sit in bed and do there homework. Even if they have a doctor appointment for being sick they can just sit in the wait room in that time being they can just do there work while they wait.

If it was me to chosse if I want to take online or just normal school. I'll pick school because it's much easier for me to learn because teachers would make sure your learn by making take test or quizes. Plus, your can stay after school if your miss one day of school.",2.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5
3CDCFB2C7F25,"I believe that doing nothing is accomplishing nothing, it gets you nowhere. Being active, and having a purpose are essential in being successful, also always doing something is better then doing nothing.

To start off, being active can mean that you're accomplishing or trying to accomplish what you're doing. For example a boss of a company will always be trying to keep his business from loosing money, for he can't cant loose the company, so the boss will work towards saving the company.

Secondly, having purpose in life, or a goal is better then dreaming about it; for instance, if you ask a successful person how they got to where they are, they won't say I dreamed for it, they'll say I worked towards my goals and didn't give, even if they thought they were gonna fail.

Finally, always doing something is better then doing nothing. For example, if a student goes to school just to sit around and do nothing, he or she are wasting a opportunity to learn, and get an education towards what they want in life.

Some people might say, what if you fail pressing a goal; for instance, someone is trying to make money, or getting a job and keeps failing, they learn from the mistakes and keep the right mind set, if someone can do all that they'll flourish in the future.

I had the impressions that my girlfriend was cheating ,with my best friend, so I get mad ,because that impression was to difficult to believe, also you have to be carefully, when you have a bad impressions of someone, you have to know how reaction will be. Also you have to make sure that yours impressions is right, so I called my girlfriend and we had a long conversation , but the thing is that I did not know , how tell or ask her my impression that I had with her and my best friend, however I was trying to change my impression, but my mind and my brain was confucing, because that impression can put me in problems with my girlfriend or somebody else, so the thing is that I did change my impression ,knowing that not all your impressions thyat you think are rights, some impressions that you get sometimes, it's because you are not sure about something, or you no truths in that person who make you have a bad impression. My point of this statement is that the first impression it's possible to change, in the way that you, always will have a good impressionas or bad impressions, so on my example is that sometimes you have to keep your impressions and just let the things happens or like passing the time you will know if your impression was right or not. Now, when I have impressions I keep for myself, that is one of the ways to change your first impressions, because that help me on my first impressions.",2.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5
3DFE1FE3FCE8,"Success is the most important thing in this world. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I agree with him Because failure played a important role to be a success. Success is when people do hard work to get what they want to get from their lives. Most people want their success in school and to a dream job.

Graduating from school is the big achievement because for some people its hard to pass sol's or exam. They study hard to pass that class so they can graduate from school. Like if someone came from another country and that person does not know how to speak English. That person might fail all of the classes like English, history, and science. That person will try their best but they might not get on the first time and they will keep try until they get what they want. If some student fail there test from that failure that student know how they can fix in the next test or how they can be better then the last test. They can be more prepared.

A lot people find a job which they like to do but some people does not get their dream jobs. And some people never give up. One person who want to be a dancer but his dad does not support him. He never give up to convince his father but still his father does not listen to him. He leave his house to be dancer but after leaving the house he has nothing, he don't even have money to pay for his school, but still he never give up. He started his know dance workshop where he get money so he can pay for his school. Now he is the one of the best dance choreographer in India Remo Dsoza. When people went for job interview some people get the job on the first time. But some people have to work hard until they got the job too. They work on how they can be better next time so they can get the job.

In conclusion, success is the thing which everyone wants but they are not going to get it give they did not work hard. To became a successful people have to learn from their mistakes. Failure is the key of success because if people are not going to fail they can't be better next time. In this world people who are successful in their lives right now they also have failures in their live too. To become Successful people have to learn from their failure.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0
3E156DCB07C7,"We accomplish more when we are always doing something not when we are being inactive. There are many people out there who are most of the time through out their day are being idle and never doing anything, they're always sitting around and won't do what's the best for them by trying to at least accomplish something in there daily life. Although some say being idle does not serve a purpose, actually being idle does serve a purpose, rather you should go out and accomplish something better for yourself.

You might say being idle is not the good for you, but being inactive can sometimes be the best for you. Thomas Jefferson said that ""Determine never to be idle."" Thomas Jefferson doesn't realize that the reason being idle can sometimes be good is because you might not notice this, but in your daily life you can be doing to much for yourself to the point where you won't even realize how much you have accomplished. Once in a while you should think to yourself what you have done and accomplished during the week or day, it makes you think that you may need to be idle and put some time away from things that you usually be doing. What myself believes in is that you aren't always going to be doing so much for yourself in your daily life on what you want to accomplish in. Sometimes you need to put it all away for a short amount of time and give yourself a break and just be idle for once not for such a long period of time, but make time to do your own things. One thing that is true about being idle is that it serves a purpose for being inactive, but the reason why that is good because you can always go accomplish it another time and you can come up with thoughts or ideas, for later on when you want to accomplish it.

However, in my thoughts always being idle isn't good for you because you may have time to be idle, but you don't have all the time in the world to be idle. It would then just keep you away from doing things that you want to accomplish on, Which will then make your mind not want you to do things in anymore. In my perspective what myself believes in is that being idle for to long is such an impact on your life because when you take your time away from the things that you usually are always doing and have a daily schedule for it makes you forget what you had going on and what you were trying to accomplish in. Thomas Jefferson said that ""it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Which is true because you can get so much done if you are always doing, and it is wonderful like Thomas Jefferson said. You're doing a lot of work and accomplishing it all by succeeding in the things that you need to get done, and it's an amazing thing to do because you rather do it now then doing it at another time and put so much stress to yourself. In my opinion, accomplishing it at the right time is better than accomplishing it at a different time. To explain what my opinion said is, do it at the right time when you have the chance to do it rather than doing it at a different moment of the day. It will makes things much better for you because it's better to get things over with now. You would't want to worry about it later on it would then just make things much more of a problem.

Additionally, in my thoughts being idle keeps you away from doing the things you want to get done, it makes an impact on yourself on what you're trying to get done and it can distract you from your work. Something that is true is when you're are being idle, it keeps your focus on staying in the moment that are in which is doing nothing. An example of being idle is staying in bed all day on your phone. Why would somebody want to be doing that when you can be out accomplishing your goal and succeeding on what you want to become in life. Thomas Jefferson also stated that ""Determine never to be idle"" if you were to never be idle you can accomplish so much and keep on doing what you always do. People shouldn't let themselves get distracted by being inactive, they should take an advantage of all that and think rather than being idle they can be out accomplishing there goal and reaching for somewhere better. In my opinion, people should do more to get to where they want to be in their life because if people are doing that then you're definitely accomplishing something better for yourself.

In conclusion, although some say idle does serve a purpose and should be accomplishing their goal rather than being idle. In my conclusion people shouldn't be idle because it will easily distract them from doing better things and accomplishing their goal, and it wouldn't be great for everyone. Once in a while people would get inactive way to much and just forget about what they have to do or accomplish in. Many believe being idle is good for you, but it can lead to a bad habit of you always being inactive and no want to achieve in your goal. In my statement idle does serve a major purpose in peoples daily life and can just keep them away from doing what they do. Some say people should accomplish more on always doing something and shouldn't get inactive.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
3E1A0BAC4372,"Sometimes knowledge is very helpful but sometimes imagination could be helpful to.

When I was seven years old I imagined many things but they never happened. When I turned 13 years old things changed and they were not the same as I imagined before. I thought that I was gonna acomplish those imaginations in my head but they never did. One day I noticed that imaginations were not better than knowledge.

One day my mom and I were suffering because we couldn't get to the other side of the river and we decided to build a boat to get to the other side and we made it. The knowledge we used was unexpected because we never thought we were gonna make it to the other side. Knowledge is very helpful when you are struggling with something but you also use imagination because you think before building or making something.

I believe that imagination could be important sometimes but knowledge is more helpful and we use it very often. Imagination could change things but not better than knowledge. We might always think that imagination is better I agree with you but if you think of how easy it would be use knwoledge while you are struggling than you would understand the differences.

Knowledge is very helpful in many ways and very often. I disagree with the prompt saying that imagination is better than knowledge.

3E7DE9C1C160,"What lesson would you chose to teach elementary school students? Would you chose math because they like numbers, or science because they like playing with science experiments. I would chose science, because we use science every day by turning on a light, to throwing a ball up in the air. Another reason many students like science is because it is the most fun, by that I mean by all the experiments we do in science. One lesson I would like to teach elementary school students is about science because it is fun, it is the most easiest subject to teach, and it is the most used in daily life.

Firstly, one lesson I would like to teach is science because it is fun to most adults and kids. First, science is fun because you get to do different types of experiments. For example, If you want to learn about kinetic and potential energy you can use science experiments that have kinetic and potential energy in them. Some experiments can have you involved in throwing a ball so you can illustrate kinetic and potential energy. Second, science is fun because everybody can enjoy it.

For example, say one student does an experiment everyone in the class can experience it because they all witnessed it. Lastly, science is the most fun to make a lesson about because it involves you talking to other people and sharing your observations. For example, If you did a egg drop experiment, you will compare your results to different types of students in your school and hopefully learn from what you did wrong or the opposite. Therefore, science is fun because you get to deal with experiments.

Secondly, one lesson I would like to teach is science because it is the most easiest to teach to many students and adults. First, science is the most easiest because it does not require you to memorize or remember something every single time. For example in other subjects unlike science you have to memorize the root words for English, or memorize the formulas for math, But here all you have to do is memorize the terminology and you should be good to go. Another reason why science is the easiest is because it is involves experiments which are not hard to understand all it requires you to do it pay attention. For example, If you pay attention to the experiment then you will know every bit of it, But in math you have to keep on practicing again and again until you get it. Third, science is the most easiest to many students because it involves drawing pictures which is the most easiest way to understand something other than memorizing. For example, say that the students don't get it by words so, what you can do is illustrate for them so they get what you are trying to say. This works best in science because because science is the subject that involves the most of drawing and experimenting. So at last, science is the best subject to teach about because it is the most easiest to understand.

Thirdly, I would like to create a lesson about science because it is most used in daily life. Firstly, it is most used in daily life because everything can relate to science. For example, it can be related to light because light can cause radiation, it can be related to the air conditioning because it involves air traveling in currents. All of these thing are related to science and there is certainly more. Secondly, Science can help you understand more of your daily life by performing a lesson. For example, say that you don't know how to use a compass, science can tell you the answer to that because it relates to the magnetic field. Last, science is the most used in daily life for fixing things and being able to understand how things work. For example, science can tell us a lot of information, some examples can be how does a circuit work, how do fix a circuit, how does a light turn on so fast, or other possible things too. In addition, science should be the lesson because it is the most used in real life.

In conclusion, one lesson I would like to teach in elementary school is science because it is the most fun and makes a lot of students smile when they do science, it is the most easiest to teach because it involves minimum talking but a lot of drawing, and lastly it is the most frequently used in real life. So therefore, I should get my science lesson ready for the elementary school students soon because they would have the most fun in this while learning. Would you teach science why or why not?             ",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5

and it makes alot of sense.

and its possible for it to change.

my life was complicated at first, but I always thought of a solution to escape my problems, as when I was little my life was a living hell, I always got laugh at, even if I didn't had a reason to get laught at, so I saw through my life and thought theres was a reason to live anymore, but then I ask people about there life, and they told me everyone love them, and that hurt me very much, so I gave up and didn't ask anyone for help. until one day. one person in my class told me if I was okay, and I responded back saying, ''I want to end my life'' and he in tears, gave me hope and told me if I wanted to play soccer in his team, and I told him, I will think about it, and after the day pass, I became a new member of his team, I practice so hard, his coach saw in me potential and told me I should be the captain of the team, and it made me so happy, I started asking my parents to buy me stuff like food, and stuff I needed for traveling with the rest of my friends, so then the days pass through, and I woke up so bright, I couldn't wait to get ready to travel with my friends, so when I arrive to the school, I started practicing and getting ready to play for the team, then I saw behind me my team with a soccer ball, to get ready for traveling, when we started packing up, we saw this huge bus that was so cool, even a giant could ride in it, so we ran as fast as we could to the bus and I got the first seat in the bus, so my friends got jealous of me, and start throwing papers, but I was so happy I ignore the team and started thinking of the soccer championship, then waste my time fighting for nonsense.

the next day we all woke up and the bus stop us at a food shop, were they sell all kinds of stuff, and I was so sad, I forgot my money, but I didn't forget to carry my lunch, so we all finish eating and came back to the bus and travel again, and traveling we saw through the window amazing places, until we stop and ran out of gas, and stop at middle of the road, I was so mad, I scream very hard, and threw papers, until the teacher told me to calm down, he told we could instead have fun playing soccer at a private place, because it didn't matter if we didn't make it to the league, what matter to are teacher, is to put smile on are faces.",2.5,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5

Students some times don't have time to go to school every day, some of them works in a part time jobs; That's difficult to them because, they need to wake up earlier to go to school and do homework in the afternoon.

Some students decided not go to school any more because, they need to work to pay bills, and help their families in home. Also, with this option students can be relaxing in their homes and studying at the same time. Another example why this is a good option for students is because some of them need classes to graduate, and they can not get that classes done by the school year, but if they have the possibility to take classes online they can finish during the year.

However, this beneficial option is good for those students that are not eligible anymore to attend school because of their ages. There is a final age that students can be accepted by the school, and if they had more than the age the school said, they can not attend to school anymore, even if they want to continue going to school and graduate. That's why online classes from home is great idea for those students who wants the diplomat.

In conclusion this option is beneficial for all students that want to study and do other jobs in the same time.

Students working from home is good for kids that could be getting buliud either they speack up but dont see a change, having problems with adults here at school that don't really help much but just bring the student down, or maybe just being an anti socicl person. Online school is something really seroius to look into if tyour dealing with problems at home having so much stress in you and cant deal with more stress of school, or you just simply need to work to help out your family it could be a chance they need money but cant get enough to get bills paid and need help in paying them,maybe you dont really have time in showing up to school. I think online school is a good choice for many students that could have problems at school and not seeing a change. Students wouldn't have to get up so early in the morning having to look presentable or anything just having to have a good schealue that works good for both work and school. Both online work or video conferencing are good for kids that have their ways in learning like as in having videos chat with a teachers. Students can be fast learners just by reading insturstions they got it memorized and having the work ready in less than an hour. Others students are more to a visiual learners that have to see work getting it explaned to many time for them to undersatnd the work some students are slower than others. Online school would be the best choice to many students that just have it the ruff way and not easy. Other reason is because many kids get sick really easliy and its better to keep those kids away from others in getting sick. Online schools can really make a big change in kids that are just not ready have more stress in them and wouldnt have to deal with more problems with parents or maybe getting bullied.

I'm disagree because for me is the same thing that the businesses adopted a four day week that consist of 10 hours of work, because if they work the 6 day's at week doing 8 hours at the end is the 40 hours at week same with if you work 10 per day in four day's at the week.

When the businesses make the people work the 10 hours per day in four day's week the people get more tired and most people do workout in the morning or in the night and i think that if you work 10 hours per day you dont going to do your workout because your going to be tired and the only thing your going to do is sleeping

If the school follow the same model and extending school day two hours for some student is going to be good but at the time no because if the students come to school for four day and add two more hours they will be in home doing nothing and they can play all day in video games, and that cant get more energy, for other student can be bad because some students work after school and that can affect them.

Students don't have tow worried about what they need to be working on. Teachers should designed summer projects because it helps students to learn more on what they need to do and students know what they need to be doing without stressing about it; however if students designed projects it could be wrong.

First, teachers should designed summer projects because it help students on what they need to do.

Second, students know what they need to be doing without stressing about it. Helps students to understand what they have to work on. For example, there are many students that stress about it because they don't know what projects they need to be doing. Students take their time and do their work because they know how to do it. Many students don't get work done at home during summer because they stress about not knowing what they suppose to be doing, that's why teachers should designed projects.

For example the people who came to this country, they came for a better future, better opportunities and they need to learn a new languaje and that's not easy for everybady some people learn very quickly but other people not.

calsses by way online that's great for some student because they have a great idea and reasons to take classes from home for example some student have child and they have to care about their baby's so they can't go to school for them that's a great opportunuty to study and do what they want, this people just need motivation to keep going and they can gain their goals.

I think students they don't be benefit attend classes from home because at home they have too many things that can be disctracte for them with things like electronic devices, or persons like childrens, and any other distract thing.

Video conferencing that's good form to learn for some people who want to attend classes from home but if you have any question or any dude you can't ask to this video that's why I thing that the best way to learn is going to school and work hard every day to do and study what we want to do in the future, we have our future in our hand if we do any bad thing some day we pay for that, always we have to think and be sure for what we want and do. in this life everything the we do to somebody good or but someday that thing comeback to you and there woud you feel what other people someday fool for your foult.

42BF43BF8DBE,"Why does the curfews are important in some cities and state for teenagers? The importance's of having curfews in the cities is that they will be out of trouble. Sometimes teenagers not follow the law especially on weekend. Having the curfew in the city will be more helpful for their life. Curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because teenagers will always follow the law, and teenagers will never put them salve in a trouble that may hurt them some way.

Firstly, Curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because teenagers will always follow the law. For instance, Generic_Name lives in Generic_City Virginia and he said that the law here is after 10 p. m. teenagers should not be on streets or anywhere else. He always follow the law and keep him self out of trouble. If the city adopted the curfew after that the teenagers will start breaking the law after these hours. Therefore, every state and city should require curfew for teenagers.

Secondly, Curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because teenagers will never put them salve in a trouble that may hurt them some way. For example, My two friends went outside to have some fun and it was weekend. Saturday night there were out to get some ice-cream for them salve and family. The police stop them in their half way and asked them about what are they doing at this time outside;however, he said that you guys know that the curfew is after 10 p. m. teenagers should not be outside. They lied to police that we were in hospital with our mom, and in our way we bought some ice-cream also. Thus, teenagers never put them salve in a trouble so having curfew is much better then not having it.

Some people argue that, having curfew in a city or state is wrong because they think its interfering in young people's lives. This point is true that curfew keeps teenagers from getting in a trouble. However, curfew can safe teenagers lives because in this age they don't know wrong and right they do what they like, and what they are interested. Curfew unfairly interfere in young people's lives because some teenagers have their own rules, and they don't listen to anyone. Lastly, cities should have curfew to safe teenagers lives and do not adopted the curfew.

In conclusion, the importance's of curfew is to have a better and safe life in your city. Teenagers have the ability to follow the law and get safe of trouble. Some teenagers does not put their self in trouble even if they lie they never get in trouble. Some people says that curfew is a force on young people's lives. Therefore, teenagers should be responsible, follow the law, and keep yourself out of trouble.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0
436450E48EC8,"If teens are at midnight at the streets, they would be breaking a law of the city.

It is a good idea because teenagers can get home early, their parents would bot be worry where they are at and they would not get in trouble.

Almost the mojority teens now a day they just want to hang out with their friends at midnight and the city is making a law that teenagers can not be in the streets at that time if the night. If they are, teens are breaking a law, and thus law is good because they can be more early at home and not get into troubles with the city and their parents too .

The city by creating this law, that teenagers can not be at midnight. Every single person is getting a lot because the streets would be more safety and with less problems in the city or community like robbing staff from house or places, assassinations that can be cause just by problems, less teens smoking and getting this time of things like vap, drinking alcohol, and smoking cigarettes, and thing that can cause them really bad thing in their lives.

Third reason is that by creating this law majority of all the teenagers the ones that are in the streets at midnight, they can avid things that are bad for them like get arrested by the cops, been sent to jail, or more if they are not from this country, if they are immigrants they can get into more problems like getting deported to their native country. And it cause them more problems in their future of getting a job or trying to get a better life.

Every city should do or make this law so that teens can be more awared what they have to do.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0
43AE9E4D0EFC,"I would say that I am agree because If you want a succesful life you have to learn how to made your life easy showing to the world that you are special that you can be a nice person does not matter what the other people said or think, you have to take everything with calm and if you have problems you have to solve it with a good attitude because if you get angry you do not going to solve in a good way that is why you have to be a good person with everybody, have peace in your soul, and the last but not least have a good connection with the people that are around you, you have to put a happy face to everything that comming directtly to you.

When you are a good person with all people you made them feel good and also you feel it, because when you are a goood person you are saying that you are different to everybody, because in this world we can see that alot of people are so bad but that does not mean that all of them are aqualsbut ypu do not have to stop being a nice person just because you know people that have a bad attitude, the only thing that you have to do is be away from all of them and give to yourself a chance to know that really think like you that can make you feel as in family, this people will make you feel better because you are showing to them that you can have people around you that can make you have a better life and also more succes, for example I am a good person with all people ,with my family, and with my friends; I am gonna told you something about my friends they are specil I love them and they love me you know why because I took my time to know them, now I know what they like or how they spend their time and the most important they think that I am a succes person that make have a good attitude with them and I want them in my life and I think they will have a a nice life because I see in them that they will be very succes people.

I think that have peace is a important part of your life, because from your soul you get a lot of good feelings that make you feel comfortable,but in the same way sometimes you can have something and that make you be incomfrotable but there is you have to try to have peace, I konw that can be so difficult, do not have peace inside of you can affect you in some ways in your life, I think that to feel peace you have to do things that really like you or find something that you can make always and is not bored and also not get angry so easy because just for one problem you can be mad for a weekend or more and that is not good for you there is anything better than have peace, when I was 12 my younger brother did something that do not like me in that timeand I still remember since the first day I can tell you is not good have that mind inside of me, I am 20 now and I think that mind is gonna be with me the my whole life, but I trying to do not remember but when I remember I tell to my self that I love my brother and we are so close and he is a person that is there to hear me and when I talk with with him I tell to him everything thatv is happening in my life I feel peace in my soul.

A good connection with people that are around you can help you to have a good attitude because if you meet people that always are positives or always talk about things that are going to help in your life they can influence in your future because they know what they want in their life or what is bad for them those people is nice to meet, are interesting to hear, you can learn somethings from them and you can share some ideas, but in ypur life you will know a lot of people maybe good or maybe bad some of them are going to be nice, they will ask you to go outside a lot of days or they will invate you to have fun and you will think that those people are the good for your to be succes, but let me tell you sometimes the good people are the ones that offert to you not a party if not something that can be good for your life something that is not going to affect your future , and I know sometimes you are going to feel that the people that want to help you are the bad ones but not you are wrong, I know a person that I saw a great future he studied with me, he always had good grades, he always did homeworks, he was a nice guy this happen in the sevent grade, but when we attend the nine grade he start to meet people that they had bad grades they di not do homeworks and I think they don not wanted a future, some months later his grades goes down but was because he always when I ask him where he was, he was going something bad with his new friends and then he turns to one of them , and I think he do not attend college, this is why I am saying to have a successful future you have to be with people that are going to help you in your future.

I think we all agree after this three points that were; a good person with everybody, have peace in your soul, and have a good connection with people that are around you, this make me think how important is have a good attitude, show a good attitude to everybody, and have a good attitude does not matter what is happening in your life.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0

The reason why learning from the experince from others is so you could learn from their mistakes, learn what they went through, and how they dealt with it.

You learn from peoples mistakes. If you learn from other peoples mistakes you could avoid them. I find it really helpful when I learn from others mistakes. Learning mistakes could help you in life to be sucssesful. My friends make a lot of mistakes which I learn from them. Most people do think making mistakes isn't a good thing, but I think it could help you improve on what you did wrong. What I'm saying is that learning mistakes frorm others is a good thing.

You learn what they went through. Learning what others went through could help you understand people more. Understanding people could help you understand people more. Another reason is that learning what they went through could help you a lot in the future. If you find someone like them, you could help them. You could get close to the person and know them better. getting to know someone could help you make a friend, which is something everyone needs. learning from other and what they went through could help you sometime in the future.

You could learn different ways on how they solved their problem. When you find out how they solved their problem, it could help you. You could be going through the same thing and might need help or advice. If someone else is going through it, you could help them or give advice. In my opinion, helping others is a big thing in life. You learn that most people could have the same struggle, and they solve it in different ways. I think it's a good thing to know that two people went through the same thing, and had different ways to solve it. In conclusion, you should learn how others deal with their problems.

Because a lot of people don't came to school because they need money to buy food and pay his rent because they don't take help from his family. For my example i came to school because my family help me but a lot of people from others country came to this country and they don't have family here so they wanna study but they wanna help his family and his county and if a lot of school have the program what you can take class from you home i think is more better because you can do a lot of thinks for example i know a lot of people they wanna study but they need to work so they say they can't study and work in the same time so they have to take one of two option so they have to pick one and they say they wanna work because if they go to school they can't make money and if they work they can buy his food and they can pay the rent for example i have one cousin he was in school and he need just one year to graduate but when he was in schhol his mom said he need to work because she don't wanna pay his rent anymore and he leave the school and he dedicated just to work because he need pay his rent and if school have the program he can work and he can study too that one is to sad because he ned just one more year to graduated and he don't graduated because he need pay his rent tha's want i think is a lot of school have the program they help a lot of guys

Here is one more example a lot of people live in mountains and the bus don't go so they don't have transportaion so they don't come to school that is sad because maybe they wanna study and they can't come. i know people in west virginia. they don. t go school because the school is like 1 hours and they don't have transportation. and if all the school in united state have the program they can help a lot of familys and they cxan open a lot of doors for the people.

Here is another example i have one friend. He come to school just one or two days per week. Because he need to work. Because he said he have to work because he don't have money for buy food and pay rent in the same time that is sad because he said i want to graduated but i can't because i havde to work for pay my rent and buy my thinks. and if schools have the program they can help him to do his gol.

I meet one friend in walmart last week i play for soccer team in Generic_City . and i was with my short that say barsity in the from of the short. and the guy said hey in think i know you and i said where you saw me. and he said in Generic_City and.

4585DE769AE9,"I don't believe the students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. First of all, the research showing there is a lot of chance to know about the distance. It's hard to make the online or video to offer the distance. Because when the students are in online or when they try to make video they are not going to take care them self. For example: I remember when I was six grade my friend PROPER_NAME was making online video. We went to classes from home to know how far it is. On that time she just focus on her video she wasn't focus on her way. After that, she try to cross the way but she still making video. She didn't saw the car she try to cross the road. So,she got some accident because of the video and she just focusing what she is doing.

The most important way is to offer the distance classes from home is using map. It's easy to know how far or how close it is. Other ways, the students have to take care there self when they are in the way because there is a lot of car.

Additional, there are not going to take care them self when they are making online or video. They just focus what there are doing. For example: when I was tine grade I remember my friend PROPER_NAME she was eleven grade.

She try to offer the distance for her friend by making video. When She was school from home. Then, she started showing the way. On that time, she wasn't take care her self because she was focusing the video.

Next, she try to cross the way by raining. She didn't pay attention the way and she got car accident. On that time she passed away she died. I agree some students think they would benefits from being able to attend classes from home. But most of them are not going to take care them self because there are not focusing the way. They just focusing what there are doing or they just focusing online or video. Additional, using map is butter than making online or video. Other ways its hard to make online or video for offer the distance. Most students are not going to focus when there are making that.

In conclusion, I don't believe the students would benefits by way of online or video to offer the distance. There is other way to offer the distance from classes to home.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
45DF17CF4937,"Did you know that the Bahamas is one of the most wonderful places in the world.

One place that I would like to visit is the Bahamas. Bahamas has one of the most incredible views in the world for example the oceans and their colorful fishes they have in, the wonderful long mountings, and the the breezy weather they have there with the colorful tasty food. There are so many activities you can choose to do there for example mounting climbing, food competitions, dancing, and swimming. Some places don't have these types of activities, food, and weather.

The Bahamas is expensive, and its one of the most expensive places but it is worth it to go there for fun and entertainment. Some people would rather waste their money on other fun place for example Paris, Germany, and Italy. One thing that I would like to see when I get to the Bahamas is the wonderful culture of the Bahamas .After seeing the culture I would climb the mounting all day to just see the view from the mounting, and to see the colorful plants. Visiting the Bahamas could help me lose my stress,

and help me learn more about the cultures, and more about the language.

Have you ever thought of what new skills you can learn from just visiting a new place?

Some people learn new skills when they visit a new place for example cooking, climbing, skiing, and biking.

One talent that I would like to learn or become better at it is biking. I love biking that why I choose this talent, and

I could get on a biking team if I become better at it. Bahamas could help me because of its large safe streets some places don't have these types of streets and some do. I could bike throughout the whole city without getting hit by a car.

Have you ever asked your self what is it like to live in the Bahamas?

I would like to live in the Bahamas but its expensive like every other place some places are less and some places are more because of the food, views, and living. Some people live in the Bahamas even tho its expensive these people might have found a job there that pays well or they were born wealthy. Living on the beach is hard because it is expensive, and dangerous because of the storms and other natural disasters. I choose to live away from the beach because it is safer. The Bahamas have enormous amount of colorful plants and animals that is why I want to visit the Bahamas.

In conclusion the Bahamas is one of the most beautiful colorful places in the world with enormous amount of activities, talents, and cultures that is why I want to visit The Bahamas.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5
462832DCD932,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"". In this day ling life to be yourself individuality in this world. distinguish, normal, healthy, sane condition, and selves. Is the greats accomplishment by Author Ralph Waldo Emerson.

I agree with this, In this time we has a human being trying to be an unique person. A music artists, drawing artists, or a teacher etc.. as an example; A teacher can trying to do something especial with his students. That can be something that nobody did it before. That make an unique teacher and that can end really bad or good either this, people going to judge he/she, however; the world constantly trying to make you different. And that change is gonna be to make you a unique person. When Author wrote ""To make you something else"".

Negative persons consisting trying to change you, make you something else or judge. For my opinion that simple thing can be strong. Why? is the way that you looking, as an example; they gonna judge, but you gonna be strong and not worry about that, because you are a human being in this life nobody is ""perfect"". We can be unique in this life, we also can guide by people are already death. In the past, a member of your family, a artists, or a person that did a great job or something unique. that can also help us to get some ideas, as an example; the men who created ""Facebook"", this person is unique. because he created something inclusive that beans created before Is a positive change of the ""life system"". What I trying to say it is. In the cycle of life, we as a human being; born, growing up, reproducing, and dead end. In the cycle an example; when we are in the stage of growing up, they let us know to understand that we have to made a decision. For example: ""What you want to be in this life when you old?"". this trying to understand that we have to make a decision to contribute to this ""life system"". To make it better world as an example; teenager trying to decide a career for college, to contribute something good for this world, however; that decision of the teenager can be, wherever he or she want. People can judge or be bad with you, but the end of the day. It no important anymore. This is only one life to live wherever you do with this life, is your decision.

46EF1F716C52,"Did you know that some teachers/educators want year round of school. My decision for this topic would be, I want year round of school. I feel it would benefit students and teachers to actually focus and maintain on school work. Some students would disagree with this, but there are some supportive reasons why this would benefit the both.

Reasoning number one, Most students take a 3 to 4 month summer break. If there was year round schools it would 3 to 4 week summer break, a longer winter break, and one week off for winter and fall time. This would benefit students to be able to retain lots of amounts of information. Also students would have an extra break for the one week off in the fall time.

Reasoning number two, Students who take more than a 2 month break will most likely forget what they have been taught in school. That adds more work to teachers because they would have to re teach the information back to the students, and it would take longer for the students to remember the information. Students who would do year round of school would be able to remember the information that they were taught and it would be less work for teachers for them to re teach it.

Last reasoning, After when students come back for a break most teachers have to re teach what they taught the students before break. Also normally when students come back from long breaks some teachers start giving tests or even quizzes. Most students don't study while they are on break, so they are likely not able to recieve a good grade on the test and quizzes. But with year round school the students would be able to obtain the information and less likely fto orgot what they have been taught before Summer, Spring or Winter break.

Overall, It just seems students and teachers would benefit a lot more with school being year round. The teachers would have less to re teach and students can obtain more information. Also it would help studnets do better when it comes to taking to tests or quizzes. So it would be a win win for everybody. ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
473FF163E44A,"_Yes i think yes its can by a benefit to attend classes from home because many students come late in the school and the teachers sometimes they mark they students are absents or late, but may the school can give the opportunity to who work or to who need it because many student we are working in at the night and sometimes we see many of they students sleep in classes.

_But if we attend classes from home that will by better because we will sleep more time at home and we will don't come at the school every day or wake up the same time all day, but the teachers will by attent for their students who has take their classes from home to send their work or to help they students when they don't understand or sometimes we stock to do or how to do and then the teachers will by help.

_But is a bad idea to because many students are may don't wants to doing all they work at home because they knowing they are home and when we are home we prefer doing others things except the school work and that can by a problem when we take the test because many students can fail their test, because in home we can find the answers in internet or anywhere but when we are in the school every day we can't use our phone or anything to find the answers because the teachers wants to test us what are we know or what we are need to know to by better and to resolve all you'r work in you'r own idea may the teaher can give you some ideas or examples or explain how you can do it but is diferent like when you finding the answer in internet because the internet can give you all the answer and yuo will be no learn nothing because it's just copy what are you see except with the teachers you learn more because they tell to you to try to do it in your own and you have an idea to what are you going to do.

_And it can by hard for the students to graduate because can affect they attend in the school and will many students going to skiping because they can come in the school but they can leave early because they can find a excuse to to leave and to do the attendece at home or just skiping classes and don't doing nothing.

Everything is easier to get, games, books, news, and even shopping would be easier for everyone. Say your teacher wants students to read a certain book but there isn't any left in class. What would you do?. Technology will allow students to download the book and still be on task with students. Some teaches don't allow you to take the book home but with any device you can simply download the book and still be caught up with the chapter. You wouldn't be behind.

They don't like to miss the days news or any news. If they did, they can type the date and see what's happening. You wouldn't miss a thing! alerts will pop up on your device to inform you. Therefore, everyone stays connected to the world in any device. Technology, also allows you to stay connected with other, such as your parents and friends.

49718724CB84,"Does the people that have mastered something can grow, even if they do not try nothing else? Some people believe they are very okay only with what they have mastered. People knows they could master one profession, but they also know they wont grow in nothing else if they do not try nothing else. If someone decides to only master in one thing that is okay, but that person's knowledge will only increase on what he master, nothing else. People cannot grow if their mindset is stuck with what they mastered and they wont increase in knowledge.

People cannot grow more if they stick only with what they mastered. For example, Ms. Generic_Name, a really good looking woman, had a store for plants and she also teaches about plants. One day Ms. Generic_Name had to let some kids know that the plants do not grow by itself, people make them grow. She called the kids to the back of the store to show them apple's seed. Ms. Generic_Name told the kids that she used to take care of them but she stopped, because she thought that once the plants grow enough, she would not have to deal with that again. She saw the plant standing and she thought her work was done. She did not take care of her plants no more because she thought they were okay in that position, but she did not know that the plants were not gonna grow more. That is exactly what happen with people that mastered something and they just stick with that, they did not try nothing else and now they are just steady they can't grow no more. Thus, if people believe they are okay with what they mastered and they don't try nothing else, they wont grow no more.

Knowledge is one of the things that mostly deals with growth. For example, Ms. Generic_Name had the knowledge of every plant. At first Ms. Generic_Name did not know that she had to take care of them, at least until they could be strong enough. Now that she have years on plants she knows a lot. She did not want to stick with what she knew and now she is grown in knowledge. She is in college studying more about different types of plants from other countries. Thank to her enthusiasm for plants, Estency Generic_Name is now one of the biggest specialist on plants in the world. Nobody should be comfortable with knowing just what they want to know, people should start seeking more for knowledge based on what they want, just as Ms. Generic_Name did.

Some people may say that people could grow if they have mastered only once, because they only need whatever they have passion for, or whatever they want to do. For example,Generic_Name went to college with the dream of being a constructor and he graduated from college, now he is a constructor but not how he wanted to. Generic_Name could have being an architect but he decided to be less; however, people should seek for knowledge and not only stick with one master. People could get master at something but after that people have to be open to learn knew things every day.

In conclusion, people will never grow if they do not try out. A person's knowledge increase with the amount of time and interest. Knowledge is one of the things that most deals with growth. People could just get their master, but is better to always be open to learn more, ",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5
4975FA2ABC9D,"In the future what would you like to accomplish in school. Well I would like to know how to play the clarinet and learn how to play it for many reasons.

First, the good thing about about the clarinets is that I like when someone plays the clarinet and it sounds smooth it gives me the chills. Also when they hit a high note on it it gives me chills too. When playing high notes on it it looks easy.

Although when playing the clarinet sometimes when I go to a concert there is always at least one person that squeaks when playing it. I tried to play on it once and its hard to play when I try to play it fast. But the worst part when playing the clarinet is chipping the reed, once when you chip it you won't be able to play as good on it.

The only reason I want to learn how to play the clarinet is because I like the way it sounds, it sounds to calming and soothing. In order for me to accomplish to play calming and soothing is to practice at least 1 hour everyday . Also my last reason to play the clarinet is because i kind of think that it looks easy to play but I guess that it is a hard instrument to play. These are my reason on why i would want to accomplish and play on the clarinet.

4ABC0ED00F91,"Do you believe that in order to success is going though failure contently? People think that going though failure can help you be successful though out time. Some example could be emotions, not giving up, and a quote ""Third time is the charm."" These are some of the things that people do in order to succeed though failure.

First, when people can not got something right the first time they can get emotional such as upset, mad, and frustrated and many more. An example of this could be when you are working on a math problem and you did not get the right answer the first time people can get upset. That is why emotions can be a part of failing to get successful.

Moreover, when people can not get something done they tend to just give up and do nothing. People should never give up because not everyone gets it the fist time. One example can be when you are trying to find information about an animal and you can not find anything on it so you just give up and not do the research information and now you are going to get a zero for it which is not good. This is why you should never give up even if it is hard for you

Although, most people have heard this saying ""third times the charm."" This saying has a meaning to it because it is telling you that you have to keep on trying in order to get it right. Sometimes when you keep on trying it can turn out better then the other times that you tried. One example can be when are drawing something and you do not like it you can try again and do it better then the first time. Keep on trying in till you like it or in till you get it right. This is why this saying is very important to understand.

In conclusion, in order to succeed through failure can always be a good thing and it can help you to become better but most importantly to feel good about yourself and the success that you made.",3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5
4B174612FD60,"Imagine oneself is a student in high school who is already stressed out by all of the homework and work that One must already finish during the day, but also all of the classwork that oneself did not get to finish during school. Students are already stressed out because of school work, letting a student use their phone as a learning tool would only benefit them in finishing their work on time. This is why teachers should let students utilize their phones as a learning tool and not be against the usage of it when doing school work.

Admittedly, students could get distracted with their phones and not get their work done in time. However, Teachers can specify that the use of phones is only for academic use only during classroom hours. That anybody who is not abiding by the rules will automatically get ISS. Therefore, students would understand that it is a serious matter and would not be playing around with their phones and getting distracted.

Furthermore, students would not have to wait on the schools slow internet and wifi to finish their classwork on time. Students phones work faster than most of the computers in school and they would be able to finish their work faster. For example at the beginning of the school year at SCHOOL_NAME the wifi and internet were down almost every day. Making everybody in the school that has online classes or just courses that require the use of the internet to be behind in all of their work. Also, schools computers are outdated and full of past information that makes the computers work at a much slower pace than a phone would. This is a contributing factor to students not being able to finish their work because the computers are outdated, it takes most of them at least twenty minutes to log in. Those are minutes lost that a student could have been using to have started their class work and possibly even finish it. Consequently, if phones were allowed to be used for class work then students would be able to finish their work on time and not have to worry is the wifi is working or if the computer is taking too long to log on.

In addition, students could take their work home if they are not done with it, and they would not have to worry about being behind on their class work. Students most of the time do not have enough time during class to finish all of their class work. Making their work pile up high and since the school does not let students take computers home they could not take their work home with them. If students have class work on a specific computer app like Microsoft word they would not be able to access it from a computer at their house because they do not have the same system we have in school. For example, one of the classes that I take is econ and personal finance and a lot, if not most of the class is online. If we have to do a vocabulary in Microsoft word

I have no way of accessing that document until the next day and by then we would have something completely different to do. Letting students use their phones to do work like in Microsoft word would mean that students could use their phones to type up their paper in Google classroom and send it in or leave it in the drop box in desire to learn. Hence, why letting students utilize their phones would be a great benefit to them.

In conclusion, letting students utilize their devices as a learning tool or experience would be easier on them. If students are permitted to utilize their phones in the class room then they would not have to worry about not finishing their work during class. This is why students should sign a petition and turn it in to the principal, so the use of cell phones during class work can be permitted and not be frowned upon.",4.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0
4B957C430005,"'To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.'' I agree that it is the best thing to accomplishment because it makes that person become independent, helps you succeed and gain confidence, and gives you strength to help others out.

In addition, being yourself helps you succeed through so much, it helps you become independent to take care of your own actions. Being independent is the best thing why?. Well because it's better to accomplish your goals on your own instead of depending on another person you aren't going to have that person always by your side. People come and go not really just any person sticks by your side like that. This is why doing things yourself, achieving your goal is the best thing, you can show people that you don't need any ones help because you got yourself and that's all you need.

Also, being yourself motivates you to do better, you start to gain confidence and nothing is better than believing in yourself. Just how it's easy to gain weight it is also easy to gain confidence by telling yourself ''I can do this!.''

By having motivation you can do possibly anything, you can jump off a plane if you have the guts to. You start doing better in school or your job perhaps, you start getting good grades or start coming to work on time. Motivation is key in order to succeed in life you must have confidence.

In other words, once you start to gain confidence you need to have enough strength to help another person out perhaps they are depressed or it's just not their best time right now. Motivate them to never give up no matter how much stress you have it shouldn't give you a reason to just stop trying. We have to go through the rough times first in order to have a better life. If someone or yourself is having a really harsh time don't be pressed over it the past is the past and many things happen for a reason. I have gone through a rough time myself for 6 months now but it never gave me a reason to give up I am a strong independent woman and I won't ever stop trying to stop having confidence.

In conclusion, just how Author Waldo Emerson said '' To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.'' He is correct but, also making you into something else could also mean in a negative but we always need to have a positive mindset. We must be independent and have confidence so we can succeed and so we can help others succeed as well to become somebody in life. Never give up just be positive and everything will come your way remember confidence and motivation is key.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5

To begin, my first reason about how I use this talent for good things is that I tell the truth all the time. Because of that, everyone trusts me, and tell me their secrets. Telling the truth all the time also help people recognize me as a good person, and help me make lots of friends. Telling the truth all the time would not only help people recognize me as a good person, but it will also make everyone trust me.

To continue, my second reason is that I never betray someone. Never betraying someone will make people think that I am a good person, and people that didn't like me will start liking me. Never betraying someone is also a good thing because it will make you loyal, and faithfull. People that you never betrayed will like you and become your friend.

Further more, my last reason about how I use this talent for good things is that I am always fair. I treat everyone the same way I want to be treated, and that will make people treat me the same way they want to be treated. I also divide things evenly, so everyone have the same amount. If you want people to treat you fair than, you have to treat them fair.

In conclusion, my talent is honesty and I use it for good things like, telling the truth, never betraying, and being fair.

4D7E52C79A3D,"Does students think that learning from home would be helpful for them? Learning from home won't be as helpful as much as you go to school and learn in the class from teacher. I don't think that students would learn anything from video or online conference because if they don't learn anything while their at school, so how would they learn from home. They might have work at home or at outside, which makes them distracted or disturbed them from their work, and they might have problems with it. Every student has the right to make their decision but this idea won't work out.

Mostly, in every home there is problem which we don't want to share with anyone or we don't want anyone to know about what is happening in our home. Like fighting with mom, brother or father anyone in home or we might don't want anyone to know why are fighting. I mean people have privacy in their life or difficulties which they don't want to share with anyone, and even if they do the work from home it might not help as much as we are in school.

Commonly, every student is not equally intelligent so they can understand one thing in one time. Most of the time and most student take a long time to understand one thing in this situation if they decide to put distance learning then those student might not understand clearly and of course they won't come to school, so they can have a day off.

I mean if a student can't learn something from school how could he or she learn from home.

However, every student want to learn more and achieve something and most of them don't even care. The person who want to achieve something always try their best to do it, but the person don't care would get a chance to not learn. I mean everyone want to relax in home because school work are really tough, but even after that every student try their best to learn and distance learning can't help it out. if you are out somewhere and you're teacher is trying to teach you in online you might not get what they are saying.

However, some people might think that distance learning might help them but if they can't learn in school then how will they learn when they are not in school. I don't think if you are far away from school so you can learn anything from that. Anyway I don't think that students or the teacher might have that time to talk to every student or teacher to ask question or answer them. One teacher can handle a class together, but same teacher can't handle every student differently, so I don't think that this idea would work.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5
4D816E688FBD,"This Essay Is about:To conserve energy and resources do we have to extening the school day two hours, four-day school week?

My opinion about this question is that we don't need to extend the school day and go to the school four-day a week.

Why? Easy, because if the students spend more time in the school everday, we just loose energy.

We get tired, we are not focus in class, we forget what we learned, affect your communication with your family.

We get tired even now, that we just come for seven hours. If we spend more time in the school, the students are gonna be more tired than normal they are. Getting tired students start loosing they energy and, they do not pay attention what the teacher is saying. Sometimes I feel like I can't anymore my body and my mind need to take a rest. Your mind start loosing power when you get tired. Get tired and do not have a good rest is not healthy.

we are not focus in class.

When you start the day after a good rest, your mind start the day fresh. If your mind is fresh, you get better focus and powerful mind to think about what you are doing. During the day after few hours, you start getting tired and, loosing focus about what you are doing. If we spent more time in class, we gonna get bored and we can start talking with the neighbor, distract the others students and interrupt the class. After the school time students are gonna be so tired (body and mind) that they will want to arrive at home take a rest, leaving the homeworks without do it.

We forget what we learned.

It is so simple forget what we learned during the day, specially if we are going fast and talk about different topics. If we extend the school day, we most see different topics and we will going fast,forgeting about the last topic. This happend because we lose focus,when we are thinking in the differents process and topics. When your mind is process one information (let's say ""Math"") and, you do not even practice for a while, you just get it and, the teacher pass to the next unit (beacuse the period is longer cause the extending school day), you most will forget what you learned last unit.

Affect your communication with your family.

how extending the school day, affect your communication with your family?

Well, let's say the most of the time you are in the school, some parents work during the day. But in the afternoon when the kid arrive at home parents spend time with them. If extending the school day, by the afternoon the students are gonna be more tired than normal they are and, they just will want to take a rest the rest of the afternoon. You have three days of weekend to do what ever you want and, have a conversation with your family?

of course you have an extraday now, but remenber that's just for students your parents still working one more day. The weekend the students can use it for homeworks that mean you do not have much time to have a conversation or pass time with your falimily.

My conclution is: If you gonna get tired, do not gonna be focus in class or you will forget what we learned, it is not a good idea to extend the school day, because at the end do not bring anyhelp for students. And can be worth for some of them. Take a good rest, be focus in class and keep what you learned, those are the students beneficts. The extratime I spent on my homeworks at home plus the school day, it is enough to learnd and be focus on study and get a fresh mind.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.5

In some of the foods there is so much oil, that is not healthy instead it can make us sick. The more healthier students are the more productive they will be. They will feel like they are more energetic and want to run around, that means they will want to try out for sports. Some of lunch food now makes students really lazy because of all that oil, that means they just want to sleep and not do anything at all.

However some people may think that your character can be influence by which you interact with (like parents), and your personality is based in others personality.

You choose what you want it to be, no one can choose your own way, or in this case your character, is primordial that you choose your own traits, if you don't do that then you'll be un-secure of your self and that can carry many problems to distinguish who you are, or where you should go in life.

Have your own character is a big thing to have, because many people can imitated others character or personality from their parents or any famous person, but if you have you own character that means that you are unique. A recent study in the University of Virginia shows that people who choose their own character and their own way to act, or behave, they are happiest than the ones that imitated other people personality.

You are your owner, your are only yours! Since you are a baby you start forming your character or personality, you have control of what you want to be or what you want it to do. But some people will argue that your parents are whom form your character and they chose your personality traits, but that is not true, your character is formed by your own experiences in life, as Jonh lubbock wrote ""Your character will be what your self yoose to make it.""

In conclusion, you can be whoever you want, your character will be formed by you based in your experiences in life, no one can choose what your character or personality will be. People will always judge you, but You always must do do what your heart tells you to do, be always happy with your own personality or character, and don't let people choose how you will act (not even your parents), make your own character and act in the rigth way.

What are you suppose to think of when this question gets asked from you, well people don't really have a an answers for you,So i think that people get controlled by each other because of power. Some people think they got it all cause they have control over certain things then most people dont't have and they take advantage of them so they think its right for them to do what they can or cannot do to them. People dont need other people to show them how to belong or what they need in there life its not fair for others to pick what they want to do. People want what other people have to fit in or to roll along with them,But other people dont like that feelings cause they think they look cool, new cloths, new shoes, new bags etc they get it all and dont get me wrong people go for that some just dont. You only get to create your own self but you choose to follow others because thats the new trend and you want to fit in with what they offer to you its like a shiny new toy you can resist because then you wont be like other people.

Influences are what catches people attention they want to persuade you into something or speak to you in matter that you dont even realize in till later. They get to change you because they know how to do it they speak in way they just gets your attention and you fall for it and next thing you know you want to be like them,talk like them,eat where they go, where they visit and who they are friends with. Those people what to see what they can get from you and how beyond you can take things people crave the attention they want what other people have,So they try to much to become them and they dont even realize in till it to late and not wanna go back. I get the point why they all do that to show how much things get done,how you want it,what needs to be done or what needs to happen. People go to their influences to hear what they already know but they dont want to be alone about it cause then people wont find them to cool to hang with. Most people think they need it to survive because they never really let themselves answer for them and they dont do anything about its like a drug to them they can't resist of it.

You are your own person you just dont know how to be yourself or you think they wont approve of you,So now you probably think if you do what other people do and act like them you will think your getting notice by other people that makes you feel good and you continue to do so. So you lost yourself and cant even recognize yourself because you went to far now you cant even choices what you wanna do because people expect that from you now you let them choice your own life. They have power you don't control yourself they do you let people get the best from you and you let them have it because you didn't want to be weird and now things you aint always easy so now you gotta live with it. Trying to impress someone isnt you,its just wrong influences make you do anything you pick from good or bad and it goes one way you decide if you want that for you not what other people think and how they can get to you so quick that you do it and it all goes down hill from there. Make your future about what you think is best for you and only you stop making it what you what other people to view you as do you.

Influences may get you places but are they the right ones though or is it something i just want you to hear. Making the right choice is great you decide what your gonna do,how your gonna live your life,and be yourself,But choice tp make the wrong choice and now people control you they get to what they want because they went for it and you cant get it back any more. People like to make a little stop for themselves inside your head so they can persuade you into anything and get what they want so they do by telling you this is the greatest thing every its the most amazing thing i did. Dont be fooled by that its all in your head you want to fit in i get it but dont take it to far where even your own close people tell you that you have change .So many things are gonna be asked from you and not even you will know how to answer because you let other people control you and talk for you that it became a things that you cant even get out of. It's better if you just stay in your lane and go for the good influences and not the bad type you create your own story not other people.

Wrong to right is always the choice being a good influence is great you teach people the right way not the bad type. So many people choose bad and not good they want to fit in so bad thats its going bad for them picking the good is always right. You dont need to impress people when you got yourself and no shame for you just do what is asked and make a great thing happen. Right chooses bring you more things in life then bad getting good people in your life is always the answer a good influence can get you to a lot of things in life and you won't even notice in till it has happened. A chance to pick a good life then a bad one i'll take it bad influences bring you no where its a joke if you pick the wrong influence make a good pick. So yes creating your own life is better and deciding on good influence then to have a life that will bring hell on you, yes i will always do so. Good infleuence is always the answer not things wrong about that and will always be my choice for you be the right infleunce that other need to hear from you speak up do whats right for you and yourself make a better you and let other people hear you speak you bring goood things into other's people's life not just yours.

4F89EB8CB97F,"I think this is a great idea, normally a person graduated in four years, but if we graduate en three years of school it will be the best for our future, because we can take advantage, start college one year early, and finish it one year early, and it will better for any student who wants to take advantage in life. I think it will be better but this is going to be hardest because you have to study more time, and have classes in summer, and evenings but all effort has its rewards.

If two girls are in High School one of these (person A) took the programs that allow students to graduate in three years, and the other one (person B) took the traditional four years.

The person A graduated from high school in 2015 and the person B in 2016. while the person A was studying her first year in college and working, the person B is in her last year of school, obviously 2019 is the last year for person A in college and graduate from college will help her to work in something about her career.

Well what I do is if I graduated in just three years I will take advantage for work hard and take some few classes before go to college all the fourth year, and then the next year I will have a good amount of money for college, and when I going to college I keep working but less hours, I think this of allow high school students to graduated in three years is great idea. Knowing that the students only have three years in high school it will help the students to put effort in high school and to finish early high school and college. If more students are interests in this program it would be better for everyone, because you are going to graduate in three years, you are going to college, and then you are going to be a young professional.

people is going to say that the high school is going to be more difficult because you are going to have many classes in only three years, and that you will not enjoy your vaccation in summer or can not do something that you like in evenings, but how I said before all efforts has its rewards.

When your at a difficult moment and you have a positive attitude it motivates you to keep going and not to give up. Even during a difficult time if you were to have a positive mindset It would help you In the future by giving you confence to get out of that position you were In. Even going through a difficult moment is a good thing because it will help you during the long run because your getting a taste of the how life actually goes. Next time your In a difficult moment try to have a positive attitude it will help you through those hard times and it will motivate you not to give up.

Secondly, when I was in 7th grade my friend was taking a very important test. The test was about 35 questions and I remember he was worried that he wasn't going to pass it. He started to tell me ''what happens if I don't pass it my parent's are going to get so mad at me''. He also told me ''I'm not going to pass this test''. What I told him was ''don't worry about it do your best and you got this just have a positive attitude''. Then I went to the bathroom and once I came back I saw him jumping around and happy. Once I got inside the classroom I said ''what happened I said'' he said ''I passed the test''. I got so happy that just by having a positive attitude great things can happen to you.

Thirdly, It doesn't matter where you are weather your in a airplane or even in Mexico having a great attitude can change so much. It can even change you and your life. I once said to myself having a great a positive attitude means having a great day. When your at a difficult moment in your life or just anytime. You feel stuck of sad and you feel like you want to give up be positive and say to your self you got this I can do it. One benefit of having great attitude is it motivates you to be successful and to not give up.

People go through good things in life and bad thing's but when it comes to success everyone want's it and feel's happy about it even thorough the bad time's.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5

Most students do not enjoy doing their homework at home; for it can get quite frustrating. A lot of students favorite part of their school day is going home, but some other students favorite part of the day is their afterschool club. Now teachers and students are volunteering to meet with people who have difficulty in subjects or who want to finish their homework early,but afterschool. I think it is great that people are staying afterschool to help other people with school work and learning. It is a good to be a part of an afterschool homework club because it makes teachers do what they're best at, it helps students understand certain things better, and a club made for troubled kids makes other kids not afraid to ask for help when they don't understand something.

A teachers main job is to teach their students common knowledge that they will need when they become independent adults. Although the main job for teachers is teaching, they can, and should, also inspire their students. With this afterschool club students will be inspired to help others when they see their own teachers helping others to better understand something. Feeling believed in is an amazing feeling that students will feel in the club. The teachers who are helping the students aren't getting paid to be their, they are volunteering to help the students because they believe that the student can learn and understand something better, with their help. The people who volunteer to help their students would also be helping their community. The smarter that the teachers make their students the brighter the future we're headed towards. Not only can the afterschool homework club help teachers do their job, but it can also give students the extra help that they need to understand a subject.

Learning and understanding something new is something a lot of people struggle with. Some people struggle with learning something new because the class period that they learned it in was too short. A lot of times when learning something new it is important to have time to understand it, and one class period is not long enough. The club would give students extra time to understand the subject, and possibly do the homework that the subject required. Doing homework at home can be stressful at times. A lot of times a home is loud and distracting, but with a one-on-one class with a teacher it would be quite and not distracting. There are different ways that a person learns best. Some people are visual learners and some are verbal learners. Some students dont understand what they're being taught because of the way its being taught. A visual learner could be learning verbally, and it might just be very confusing because of it being taught verbally. The club would have teachers teaching in the students proffered way. Because of students getting extra help, more students are becoming unafraid to ask for help when they have trouble understanding something.

This club makes students know that they aren't the only ones that have trouble in school. A lot of people feel dumb because they cant do something properly or even understand it, but with the club they would see that they aren't the only ones struggling to understand the subject. If a person that you knew was getting help from a teacher afterschool and the next day they completely understood the subject, wouldnt you want to go be a part of the club too? Most people think of afterschool clubs as a fun and relaxing activity to calm down their mind from their stressful day at school. Afterschool activities are like school, but it's fun, and it is exciting. Learning can be made fun in afterschool clubs because they have students all sharing their struggles and getting help for them. The afterschool homework club would be a safe place for all the people who are afraid to ask for help, but arent afraid to be a part of a group. The club makes people feel welcome, not alone, and so much more.

The afterschool homework club benefits all the people in the community. It benefits the students by giving them the help they need to succeed. It benefits the teachers by giving them a chance to inspire others to help each other. The afterschool homework club benefits the students parents because it prevents the students from coming home to complain about their homework that they dont understand. The afterschool homework club is the best thing a school could do for their community.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.5,4.5
51C93A7260DE,"Have you ever thought what school would be like for you and other, students in your school would have a program where older and younger kids will gather around, do different activities and projects and learn at the same time.

Think about programs you will want to be included in your school,that will help you learn faster and make you understand things better and differently,you will also get help and subjects you have struggles on a daily bases. In my opinion i feel like students feel more better and cofterble talking to students there age just because it might be easy for them to explain things better to someone who is the same age. There's times where student's feel more pressured by an adult so that's what makes them not want to ask for help.

Now think to yourself and ask yourself if you find it better, having a program where all students can gather around just to ask for help when is needed and so socializes with them. Because theirs always time you get to school and talk to your everyday friends but you dont really know theres other people you havent met yet so making a program for everyone is a good way to get to know others in the program.

So with all that being said if you want to have a program at your school, that will help you and other student's gather around and bond together like friends and get to know everyone in your school. Is not just in the program that will be in your school but people that you walk by every other day gather around and teach everyone something new and they can give back to you and teach you something new everyday to anyone in the program.

But back to the main starting point of the paragraph if you want to start a new program at your school talk to one of your teachers or your principle and share the ideas you have thought of or the ideas you have in mind and gather around to start something new and make school a better place.

51CE1DCC5307,"Some people might have heard this before, ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" This is what the great artist Michelangelo said. People might not agree with this, yet setting aims higher is better. This is because by setting our aim high, people will be able to achieve bigger goals. Setting aims high might conceive more unique thoughts than people with rivet thoughts that set their aims too low. There can be significant possibilities towards many directions too.

Firstly, by setting your aim high, there can be significant possibilities towards many directions. Many people set their aims before they do or think about something. For example, which do you think will have more possibilities for job. Just applying for cleaning dishes because that's easy, or applying for every work field you can work for. This is the same for schools. For an other example, a student that does not know what he wants to do for his future choosing to go to the military, or going to collage with many opportunities. Going to the collage can increase the job opportunities and he might find a better job than going to military.

Furthermore, setting our aim high will help people to conceive more unique or their real thoughts than people with rivet thoughts that set their aim too low. For example, people that aim low are most likely conceal or are not aware of their thoughts. This is because people that aim low will not try to achieve something too hard for them. On the other hand, people that aim high will try to achieve more harder tasks, and think about more things. This will help the human brains to develop and can help people to think in a unique way than other people. Famous artists that have created significant art works could have not created anything great if they have set a limit for their self. They all did not make any limit for their self and their abilities to create great works. All the unique ideas and arts exist because the famous artists aimed high.

In addition, by setting our aim high we can achieve bigger goals than setting a lower aim for a higher possibility. For example, Just working for the minimum requirement for an assignment than working for the maximum of that assignment, which will give you a better grade? The answer will most likely be working for the maximum of the assignment. If you have your aim low you might give up before you achieve a task even if that was an important task. If your aim is high you won't give up and achieve the task. Therefore, having your aim higher is better than just trying to do the easiest thing you can.

Some people might say that by setting the aim too high that can make them suffer. This can be true, but that does not mean you should aim too low. what is important is to keep everything balanced to the best. Everyone has been said to eat a balanced meal when they were a small child. This is the same for everything. Understanding your own abilities and setting the aim to what you can possibly achieve rather than setting the goal for something easy. Some might say that if people don't aim high they won't have to work hard, so they will have less stress. They might have less stress but not every stress is bad for people. Stress can even help people sometimes. For example, I was a student in Japan that hated school and was too lazy to do any work. I had a lot of stress and that made me stay at home all the time. Staying at home did not relieve my stress at all, and I did not feel good about my self. Therefore, I chose to go to school again. Stress will mostly affect bad for you, but there are good affects too.

Finally, The hole point about this is that running away and choosing the easy way is not the best decision. Aiming low might look like it's the simple and easy way thats safer but whats really the danger is for people to forget to aim high and believe they can achieve great things. The best is to make a decision that wont make you regret and making the best aim you can make. No one has to be excellent or perfect, but everyone should try their best in their short life so they can die with no regret.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5

The issue is not all the people are doing what there ready need to do because, the people this days are doing that the thing is the best, and sometimes the best is doing what there already have done and there they never going to grow; doing things the are the are not going to help the rest of there life.

I disagree my first reason is,is you can try to do different things and help your future. My second reason is, don't be shy to do all things different. Last reason, don't be your self all the time because you never going to to know the world the you live and you never going to know your self if you never do different things.

You can try to do different things and help your future; For example if you want to do something in you life you need to start thinking about something, because in my family my sister past for the same thing the she was wasting time, but one day my mom took to her about her future if she don't start to thinking, and today she is a doctor because she stop doing the same things the she already have done.

Don't be shy to do all things different; For example my dad is was scare to do his company because he things all the work is going to be so different, and I told him if you never going to try different things we never going to grow in the future. and now we the company and the work in good, and help him a lot because hi try hard to do it.

Don't be your self all the time because you never going to know the world the you live and you never going to know your self if you never do different things; For example my mom she always said be your self all the time but one day I told her mom that is not great because if you be your self all the time you not going to rich want you want in life because your self like to do the staff the are simple are self don't like work hart to rich are gold in life.

52D0FED6AF38,"Many people debate about this topic since one of the most known scientist said this statement. A lot of people agree and disagree, and from my knowledge, I agree. Imagination is something that everyone has, not everyone has knowledge. Imagination can lead you to imagine things that other people haven't. This is how many scientist got fame by just thinking about new things.

With imagination you can think about a new type of computers, new math formula, or a new type of material that hasn't been invented yet. Many scientist invented new stuff from just thinking about new formulas or experiments that they could to make something new. There's also things like the periodic table, that the scientist who made it spent days and nights just thinking about new substances and materials, when he went to sleep, he dreamed about new substances that later on got on the periodic table.

Thinking about things in places you shouldn't, like school, could either lead you success and give new things to do and study, or low grades because you weren't paying attention, must of the times is the second option. Thinking is most of the times in math, where you have to do a hard equation and think and do a lot of work. If you like to think, that might be your favorite class and you will get good grades. Getting good grades in math is really good, it means that you have a good memory and you can easily learn new things (it usually means that when you can do a lot of problems without having difficulty).

Imaginations can also give you knowledge, when you think, it opens a new whole world of ideas. You can basically do anything you want. You can basically experiment with anything you want, but you might not get the right answer or the thing you expected but you will also learn why. These type of things can also help you to learn why something did or did not work as planned. It also helps you think about stuff that you could or not do in real life, for example doing something that is ilegal and you shouldn't do. It also helps when you think a rule or a law is dumb, you can thing what could happen if you did it, that could work to see why it's a rule.

Imagination is something that everyone has and everyone can use without a limit. Using it can lead to a lot of stuff, such as success and making new things. Knowledge is something not everyone has and not everyone can use, imagining can lead you to learn new stuff without doing much effort or risking to do it in real life and might get in trouble by doing it.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

When i was a child my grandmother shows me many ways to set things and advice, i would like to say i want to teach my friends and others peoples things like they dont know, another ways is tell them or teaching like how to play soccer, how to find this, etc.

In my life i have learn many thing like i never think i do like maintenance in toys, fix computers, and other things.

And i like my teacher teach very well because is one way to learn better others teachers dont like teach very well or just like to be angry with the students in the class and thats the reason why the students say i dont like the teacher because is angry or dont teach very well.

Give examples is the vest way to understand thing like i never understood. behavior is other thing how behavior we are in the class or in the house, our behavior is one part important in the life because the the others peoples could say that person have a good behavior i would like he can tell me a advice or example how to make this or fixed.

A example is not the main reason to influence others,there are many like the peoples watching you. just to watch others peoples i am learning new tools for the future.

I have no plan after High School the only thing is i like technology and electricity the most two parts of mi, the life is like a second we can lose everything or die.

I would like to say some words before i leave, we are human everybody make mistakes, you and me, the only thing to fixed is learn about the mistake i made or someone can help me to have a good behavior in our school or no matter where.

There is one more way is read newspaper, watch the news, ask peoples, ask questions, there are so many ways.

A good example is see how much you can do, how much do you know, dont matter what kind of color you are, you are special for everyone from the most youngest until the most oldest, every one can give a little knowledge how much he know.

There are many advice we can use to exhibit our effort and value, many peoples come to me and they ask me for a question or advice they tell me everything they want to say because they trust on me, i am the people like listening another when they need help.

I am a people who can feel many thing for others peoples.

We have the life, family, friends, neighbor , many people who can help and have a big heart, the reason we are here is for something, maybe no one knows but another yes they have a purpose on this beautiful world that our God give us.

And my final reason is have a good day every day i try to be on time every day in class because i dont like be late is one reason for me this is my goal for this year and of course pass the SOL and the class at he end everything worth, my teacher are a good example of how to influence with others peoples, comment, conversation, i like the school is one of the most reasons.",3.5,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0

with another good reason that i disagree with adding more time in school is because some people have to do things after school like take care of family or go somewhere important and if you added more time then they would not be able to do get this stuff done because they would be stuck in school learning longer then the time they are accually supposed to get out.

i belaive that there should not add more time to school because it would also be a waste of time because teachers would have to do even more stuff done buy more stuff for students and get more work done grade more papers because we would have a longer school time and then the teachers would have to write more speak more and do stuff more then they would if we had only six hours in a day.

with another reason that i dont thing school should not be longer is that it would not only affect the students and the teachers but it would affect everyone because then the whole school board would have to do more work and the school would loose a lot of money because the school board would have to buy more stuff for students and get more things that kids would need to get everything set up good for the students.

with another good reason we should not have longer school cause if we had longer time kids would not be able to handle so much because they would be learning so many thing in one day and then it would confuse them and when they are going to take a test they would be confused because they were pressured to learn so much in a short period of time and they would not like that because they might fail.

I'am pretty sure that student would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. I was a clear example of this situation, last year I take an online course and of course it benefit my self a lot. How I get benefit: well first I pass the class that I was needing. It makes you feel more comfortable, because you're attending to class from home. It is more flexible, what I means with flexible you have more time to work in other things, also you have the option to turn in the homework a little later, one last thing you administer you time whatever you like.

Student would get benefits in many ways. If they study from home and if they also go to the normal school they can graduate much early than the usual. They can find a job too, if they organize their time wisely. If they have a job so they could earn money and they can use to pay college.

If some student ask me I obviously recommend them to take online classes, it is a good way to improve your weakness and also you are going to be more success.

My conclusion is yes student get benefits in many ways when they take classes from home. and I think that every school should have the option to choose if the students wants to take online classes, and also is a good idea to help the student to be more success in the life.

54AC60510DC3,"Dear Districts School:

I am writing to express my support for the proposal to require that students can finish high school in three years. I am in favor of this proposal for two reasons.

One reason I am in favor that students can finish high school in three years is because some students they don't be able to take elective class and they don't have to waste their time to take another class. Most students can have more time to think and choose what career they want to continue to study. Since, they would like to go to the college and finish their career and get better job in their future.

Another reason I am in favor of this offer is because students can have their opportunity to start to work more and save their money to continue to study. However, some students they don't have family or helper that can help to them to continue to study. Although, students need to work hard to graduate more early, but they have to keep this opportunity that this programs offer for them.

Therefore, because this programs offer opportunity for students that want to finish their high school more early and if they want to continue to study they can take their time to work. I am agree with this proposal of this programs that students can finish their high school in three years. Thank you for taking my support.

My first week doing all that I feel tired and I feel that I couldn't do all that anymore but I realize that my family needed me and I keep doing it, in my first work I actually learn a lot about how to measure things and how to use a electric hammer also my boss is my uncle so I spend good time with him and I meet some really nice people. The second one is in Generic_Name I had to take care of kids, clean the place and make food, I meet really nice people there that helped me a lot and I realize that I like work with kids. However some students don't have a summer job and that is fine, some students likely have some family plans or plan with their friends that they want to do for summer like.

Go some to another country with you parents, sometimes parents have vacations at the same time that summer start if they change the vacations it will interfere with the time that students spend with their parents. Some students actually don't spend a lot time with their parents in fact I am one of those. our parents work to 8 AM to 8 PM and when they come back they are tired and they just wanna eat and go to sleep, and we understand why they are like that. In summer we spend time with out parents we go out to eat, we go to the movies or we go in a travel to another country that is the first reason why student prefer the vacations in summer than in another time of the year the second reason can be.

because of the sun, we all have to accept that we get tired of the cold, rain, snow and frozen rain we all get tired, and we want the sun also with the sun your garden won't die or it wont look ugly. Sometimes when we have summer some times another school from another country or another state have summer that means they could come here or we could go there and spend time with them. I actually have some friends from Venezuela and every time they have summer they come here to spend summer with me however.

Yeah sometimes it can be hard retain information but students need rest for while, spend time with their families and friends, and if they want it or they need it get a job and do their best.

Can they change vacations for another day or just have more different vacations but not that long?

No summer is not only the time where students rest, also is the time when they spend time with their parents or friends, it can be the time for some students to work and help their family.",3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0

Technology was not as big as it is today, but for some reason I have always shown interest in the products that your company has made. When you created the windows PC it revolutionized the world of technology, and ever since then I have been taking technology classes, programming classes, and even engineering classes so that one day I can created something of my own or even be a part of something surrounding your companies work. It would mean a lot if you gave me the chance to come visit your company and learn about the things your company does such as, what type of work your employees do throughout the week, the environment among and which your employees work in, and how you maintain your servers for your computers across the world I would also like to learn a little bit more of your journey as an entrepreneur in your early days, the sacrifices you had to make and the chances you took to get where you are today.

I am the perfect candidate to be picked as an intern for your company because of the fact that i have dedicated my life to technology and even followed your footsteps. I know everything there is to know about computer science, programming, and engineering. Out of all the companies that deal with computers, yours is by far the best. I have researched everything about your company going back to the roots when you were in the garage building your computer and programming them to now being one of the richest men in the world having your employees build them for you. I aspire to become a great man like you and this the perfect opportunity to show you and everyone else what i am capable of.

57E8161AEF27,"I think It's a really good idea, And students they will benefit with this idea, Bacuse they don't have to travel to school eveyday, it will be a better option taking the classes only or video conferencing because is soo much easier. And i think is more beneficial beacuse i dont think, Students would want to travel eveyday to school and back.

I think students they will benefit with this idea, because they are not going to spend that much money, In traveling to school eveyday. It will be so much easier taking classes only, because students will have more free time to do their own things, after they're done with all their schoolo work at home: for example; if the students works it will be a better option of taking classes only because he/she will have more time in getting ready for work, and been on time to work.

Reasons why I say it will be a better option taking the classes only or video conferencing, It's because students they don't have to worry, about gettig in trauble for been late to school, Because if students will travel to school schoool, there will be a high posibility of not getting to school on time sometimes it can be for many reasons; for example: traffict issus, parents they might get sick or any other reason, It will be really hard for this students if schools wouldn't offer away to study and learn at home, schools they make it easier for this students who aren't able to come to school, Myself as student i think this is a really good idea made by the school, Bacuse it gives students the oportnity of study at home when they aren't caplable to show up to school for this type of reasons.

I am agree with schools that offers distance learning as an option for the students, Because some students don't have the ability as others students, That has the oportunity of riding the bus to school everyday from Monday to Friday, This students who takes online classes is because they really need it, And they don't have a way of getting to school eveyday , It might be more difficult for them , because they might not have someone to explain them as well as a teacher. Another reason why i think some students students take only classes is because some classes that they like, some school don't have them, and they really want to know about it, Aslo sometimes parents look trought schools to see the classes option they have online so they can apply to see if their sons can takes those classes online to learn about it. One of the major reason why student take classes online sometimes is because they don't have enaught credits, so they have to take classes online, Becuase even if they come to school they won't be able to graduate because they dont have all the credits needed, Some students don't live near the schools to come all the way to school so they decide to take the classes at home.",2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5
5923F6631724,"' Why do we have to go school for eight and a half hours for five days per week? We can't do anything after school!'' Please imagine that situation. If that situation became for real, how are students going to react to it? Of course, they are going to be mad, and they might have more stress. Therefore, although some people agree with adding one and a half hours to school each day because students can have time for studying, and it is very educational for them, I disagree with that idea because it interferes their family time and after school activities, and it is going to become cause of they have more stress.

First of all, students can't have time for family and other activities. At recent, many kids hang out with their friends than families especially teenagers. I think students should have more family time to having great relationship with thier families. Additionally, some students have activities after school. Activity is an essential way to relax and have fun, and it also helps students find new hobbies and make new friends. As a result, if adding one and a half houres to school, it steals a lot of wonderful opportunities from students.

Second, it gives more stress to students. Some students have large amount of stress already. During the school week, they study for about seven hours per day, and sometimes they need to work on project and study for quizes and tests. Also, they have homework at least one subject everyday. That's why students have a lot of stress. To decrease their stress, school needs to give a time to relax for them after school.

In conclusion, adding more time to school has many disadvantages for students. Students need family time and time to work on their activities after school to have fun and relax. School is not a place that give a stress to them. School is a place that give a opportunity to get interesting knowledges to them. I believe school should overrule this idea if you think about students.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5
598C1E9B27C8,"Your character will be what you yourself choose to make. Do we choose our own character traits, or is our formed by influences beyond our control?

Examples:

1. Some people are influenced by friends

2. Everyone has their own life traits

3. Not everyone has bad traits

I believe everyone in this world has their own choice of traits but, their are some other people who are influenced by others which include, Friends,family, even people who don't know you well and dosen't wanna see you succeed and can hold you back your traits. But therefor there's people who follow their own good traits witch will lead you to a better and a successful life. Last but not least not everyone has bad traits some people will have a good influence on you witch could be good deed and take you the right way it all depends on you how you well your mind process to find out if its bad or good for your life.

1. I believe everyone in this world had their own trait of living some have good deed but some negative for example, bad traits can come from friends, family, even people not close to you i believe that because not everyone is raised with a happy living families which lead them to a bad trait of how they grew up but, on the other hand some are raised with a happy family which gave that person a good deed of living with good traits but again that could be ruin for you if you spending time with someone with bad traits.

2. Therefore everyone in the world has their own trait for Example people with success in life having big beautiful house and expansive cars had good traits which have lead them to a better life for the next generation but on the other hand bad traits will lead you to nothing but a bad life and negative traits and if you become friends with them and you had good trait you are being influenced and controlled by someone else, Some other traits can come from your relationships like if you have a girlfriend thats the worst influence that could change everything in your life and some can break you apart mentally but some can take you the right way examples of a bad relationship arguments,blaming yourself,hurting each other with actions. that could leave you with a scar you can't heal from and can bring bad traits for your future.

3. Last but not least not everyone is controlled and influenced by others because for example smart people, people will try to put you on negative deeds if you have a successful life they will hate and will try anything to take you off your path don't let any bad influence get to them and understand the fact they are trying to ruin your life, you have to step up for yourself and stay away from the bad influence that could control you and lead you a negative path my advise for the people who feel like they are being influenced and are controlled what you choose your character to be thats how your gonna be and how your gonna live so think to yourself and say what your traits are a negative or a positive.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0

The president Thomas Jefferson wrote ""it is wonderful how much may be done if we are doing."" what these means is if your always work, even for society or for your self. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something,or does inactivity also serve a purpose?. Some says inactivity serve a purpose because is a rest to get strong and keep working. Although some say always doing something is better because if you always work hard you get your goals and you are productive to the society.

Millions of people wake up every morning to work give all of them and make their best doing work, but what about people who don't work. Even if you can't find a job you can rapport to the society or your growth as a person. you can do social work or help people, you have to be an active person. Is important to say everybody needs to rest, but if you get to much rest you won't be able to reach your dreams and goals.

Do something always is good if your doing good things, work hard and passionate for what your do every person who work is for something. they want to reach goals dreams some of them got to pay to much thing or some of them just love work and make money or support your family. everybody works for something and that makes them work. My mom always tell me if you want something go for it, make it happen all of us needs a good future a better future, thats why you always have to do something. It is the reason why is better doing something than nothing.

Lets talk about the society view. In society you have to do something even if you have a dream or not because you gotta eat, where to live, pay bills, taxes and any needs that you have to cover so you have to have a job. And not just a job you can do other things to always do something like i said before help people that makes you growth as a person, and even tho is free or they pay you if you love what your do, or love to do a productive human for the society you will consider do good things.

Do something is important in the humanity because that makes these world work and grow up. dreams and goals make people do what their do. think about if you are a productive person or you does inactivity may be changes your mind. in conclusion the president Thomas Jefferson give us these quote to think about what do we do or what we should do on our life.

5BE99F2E4030,"Have you ever been thinking about doing something fun and active outdoors with your friends and family? Well, I'm going to share with you some ideas of having a great time outside. I like to invite my friends over and play with my dog outside. Or if you and your family are going on a trip or vacation, you might go to the beach. But what is it that makes these activities fun? Sometimes you may not feel like going outside and just want to stay inside and play video games, which is fine sometimes but you can't just play video games all the time. You should go outside and be active more often.

Like I said, if you have a dog you should always play with them because it's fun for both of you! Dogs tend to make everyone feel happier inside and they help reduce stress. Another great outdoor activity would include playing sports. Playing sports is one of the most fun activities you can do outside with other people. Sports like basketball, soccer, football, baseball, volleyball are all great fun activities for outside! One amazing enjoyable activity would include going a near by park because theres so much to do there! You can do a variety of fun activities such as playing with your dog, playing a sport, you can go on the swings, you can go on the slide, run, jump, you can have so much fun at parks!

Sometimes when I get stressed or upset, I like to go outside with my dog and just observe the great outdoors. It makes me feel a little bit better and my dog helps me reduce my stress. I love my dog so much and so do a lot of other people. They are really fun to play with and spend time with. Going on walks is fun for me and my dog. Walking your dog in the neighborhood is a great way to get out and be active.

Doing outdoor activities is great for everyone because you can have fun with all your friends and family and feel strong and energetic. Even if you don't like the activity, you should give it a try. Or, if you're feeling down, maybe an outdoor activity will make you fell better.

I talked to you about the benefits and the different ways you can have an enjoyable time outside. I recommend that you try doing one of these activities and spend time with your friends and family. Maybe going outside will be your new favorite thing!                ",3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5,4.5
5C05D79FE75A,"Should people make their own decisions or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters?

In my opinion, I think that people should seek guidance form experts and authorities, for many reasons this solution has prove to be effective, if a person listens to other people opinions, then the decision the person makes will not be base only on his/her opinion.

First, lets say if a male person seek guidance from experts and authorities when taking a decision, it shows that he is obedient and he will not act recklessly when taking a decision about his life, it shows that he is willing to listen to other people perspectives.

Second, in my opinion i think that asking for guidance shows matureness, it shows that you care about yourself and others opinion, it also shows wiseness when you ask others for guidance first so you can decide and make the best decision.

In conclution, people should seek guidance from experts when taking a decision about their life, I think that if people set aside their pride and worries, we humans would make better choices not just for us but for our entire environment which it also includes other species.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5

yes and no; yes, because students who are taking online classes or taking classes at home would be more focused, since there's no distraction like other students or teachers. No, because it is not very active socially and physically, unlike going to school, interacting with people, and playing sports.

Also, if the internet's not working then the student would have to skip the class because internet is what loads the videos and is used for face timing with the students. Some students can't learn just by watching a video or taking an online class, they have to actually experience the situation to understand. But the majority of the students can learn from videos and online classes.

Also maybe having a good attitude in the work place will speed up your day so you could go back home and do nothing and relax.

To say nothing of, i agree that having a positive attitude is the key to success in life. For this prompt i have some reasons why i agree why having a positive attitude is the key to success. In addition,climate change would always be the problem we would have with our earth but, hoping it would'nt be as bad as today.

Further more, the First reason why i agree to having a positive additude is the key to success because, having a good mind can help you get things done faster. For example, during school hours i complete my work on time when im not feeling too tired, or when im feeling like im doing great, and when im having alot of good energy. Having a good mind to gets things done faster, can help you not stress about uncompleted work. A positive mind can have very good idias and accomplish your goals. In conclution, having a positive mind can bring important things done faster.

In addition, having a positive additude gives good vibes everyone likes, enlighten other people day, or can lead to good things in your life. For example, when im working and im having a bad day there always a customer who changes my mood to a very positive mood and i start to work better. Having a good mood or mind can leave a good job. To conclude for, having a good mind or great attitude can lead you to big important things in your life that can lead you to greatness.

Third reason why, good attitude can help your mental health , help other people around you, or people you very close to. For example, i would be very close to my older sister because she always gaved good additude,good vibes, and she had more expirience in life that she could help me with. To say more of, this example can lead you to be more confident in your self. To say nothing of, this can also lead to feel good about your self and love your self mentally and emotionally.

Finally, having positive mental health can bring yourself to have good feelings about your self to get things done and feel good about it without hesitation.

In conclution, Having a Positive addittude is a good thing we should all do in our lives. In addition, to having these reason why i agree to having a positive attitude is the key to success in life is because, without having a good additude we wouldn't get things done and things would get things done the wrong way or not good enough to be great.

5C9B1FB411EB,"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. I agree with statement because having a positive attitude led to great success and great oppurtunity to do something that you would love, or admire.

With a positive attitude you could do more in life than a person with a bad attitude. For example, a person with a bad attitude trying to get a job as a model but gets mad over how the clothes looks on them or how the photos of them came out. Getting frustrated, or angry won't led to great success that would just make the sitution worser because modeling is a strict job and they have limited time . They can't deal with bad attitude, so you can't success with that job by being anoyed by something that you disagree on . With a positive attitude you could success with modeling because you don't have problems with nothing ,as least you had an oppurtunity to get the job.

Positive attitude led to great success like going to college, getting a good paying job, being respect by others. No one like a disrespecful person by being disrespectful you can't success in life. It's going to be diffucult but as least try be kind to others. People with positive attitude won't have a diffuclt time becuasuse there always kind and respectful to others.

I agree with statement positive attitude is the key to success in life. For example, if i was a hiring someone to work as a model and there two persons try to get the job but i need only one person i would see who haves a positive attitude i woundn't pick someone that don't have respect for others.

First impression is something no one can forget it can be attitude, love, feel but with all this impression we can not forget or change even we went to it will not be the same to impress someone with an ex we are attitude they ways we talk, walk even eat no one can change and someone try to impress his love to a girl he has be in love since children even someone come out of no where he will not be able to change the first impression of this person.

When we make the first impression to people even we know they will try to copied or change it will be impossible because everyone know the impression it is not something that we can change even we change it is not going be the same an example Generic_Name tried to impression Generic_Name with her food Generic_Name love it and went to make the same food it will be the same but it will not taste the same way because he don't known what kind of ingredient she put in and even she tell him it will not going taste the same so every first impression can not be change.

We known what it is a first impression are almost impossible to change because it kind like feeling no one can change because impression is something we do to impress people with what we have sometime is not even real or fake but some time we think it real, Generic_Name lied about her personality and family to try to impression hers friends in school they will believe her so impression can be sometime a lie but impossible to change.

5DA3135B6664,"Ralph Waldo, Emerson, wrote ""unless you try to do something beyond hat you already mastered, you will never grow."" I agree with Emerson statement these are my reaason why. First, i think if we do not prepare for more than one thing. We never will grow up. Second, have more than one knowledge than other people always will be advantage.

Last, if we do not try more than one thing that can be more hard of that we already know. we never will grow.

First reason,i think if the people do not prepare their lives with more than one knowledge. Their lives will be without direccion, and with less opportunies in our society, becuase they will do not have the enought knowledge to play a good job. For example, if they are looking to find better job with new experiencies that will be impossible to find for them, becuse they do not have the knowledge which one is require for the position. how they can be productive for the country or society. If they are not prepred to make done specific job that can be important.

Second reason, when we have differents knowledge our lives help us a lot to find the best or easy jobs. The knowledge is the most power thing the human being can have in thier hands. Some people think the knowlege is something that we can not buy from any where. Exmple, if you focus to learn. you always will be have advantage to grow. Last, i think if the people never try something hard they never will grow. we always need to try something who will bring new experiences on our lives. Exmple, when someone is goint to university and the person graduated from teacher, but if he stuck there, and not go for more hard profession he never will grow like principal etc.

Conclusion, i agree with Emerson statement, because he give to us expecific ideas what is life about when he said ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered , you will never grow. this is why i agree to his statement, and i provide all this reason.

While I was a kid all I ever wanted to be was an actress. I would try for plays in school and out, but I failed to be in the plays because I was to nervous, quite, not using the whole stage, ect. That inspired me used all those factors that where making me fail and improving them to make me a better actress.

In school/classroom always fail in sols, test, and quizzes but those students never give up trying and after trying and studying students succeed in their test.

In a community everybody tries to help out trying to catch people that break in peoples houses, but never do. The people made a list of the things they were doing wrong and they very upset people stopped trying. Until one day one person broke in to a house and instead of doing nothing like the people said the made a successful plan to catch the criminal. The planed worked and then community celebrated their success and for not giving up.

One of the most famous soccer player in the world Lionel Messi also has failed on the field whether it is on penalties, shooting, or speed he always tries to be better and all his failure has made him one of the best soccer players in the world.

When students go to different schools they can talk with their parents to what school looks better and if they liked or not and he can choose the classes that he wants and talk with their parents if that class is good or not.

They are going to be happy because they choose the classes that he have the chance to choose the classes for themselves.

Some students have a program that pairs older students with younger students. The older students are available to assist the younger students.

Is good that the students go to the schools but most will be the one's that are in the middle schools for what for nothing is good that the students that are in middle schools they are going to high school because they can talk with the teachers about the class and what is going to be about.

Can be good for some students because when get's the time to go to high school they can be sure what is going to be about the classes the he choose and all that stuff.

They are going to liked because they have the opportunity to choose their classes and for some reason is going to be more fun and the students wants to learn more about what is the teacher talking about because they choose them classes.

Sometimes the students don't know what classes they want to take when they go to high school because some students say that is hard to be in high school it is but you need to think that if you wanna do something hard you need to work hard and you can due because if you don't try you are not going to do something.

Sometimes the students don't like to help themselves but doing this can be helpful for them because they are going to say to themselves "" wait but is going to be cool choose my classes "". And they are going to want choose them classes and and they can learn what classes they can choose.

They are going to be very happy because they decided to help themselves.

They are going to help others students and see what they due and what they are learning.

Helping other students is good they don't need to be at school but I don't like this class what can I do to changed but I can't changed it help them and they are going to be happy.

My name is Generic_Name.

I Am From El Salvador.

Nice to meet you, to all the teachers in Generic_School that, i don't know.

But, i really would like to know, all the tecahers at Generic_School.

I am a hispanic boy, that i like to play, some sport after school, i really like to play, soccer, with my friends.

I like to come to school, to learn, about that the tearchers teachs to me, and all the students. I really appreciate that,

I don't like to be an ignorant boy, at school.

I really like how, all the teachers at Generic_School, teachs to the students they, teachs to you really good.

I already read the

Prompt, and, I would like to describe that, and give my opinions, and reasons.

so let's started This. I know that so many students, want to have, some educational's experiences in some activities, but others Students do not want to be in activities, others students want to have all the homeworks, done. they don't want to Miss anything, at school and it's ok, If they want to be in an activities. Of course that the school always should have The student's control. Because students can have all very good without problems, and thats why the school and the Teachers should have their controls, all the students should have all done, if they want to be in an activity, because If the school did not take the controls, of the students they will not respect, the school's and the activitie's rulers, my Opinon will be that students should have time to do some activities and they should have time to study, to do all the Homeworks, like they don't should have a lot of activities, they needed to do the homeworks to. for example, if i Would like to be in some activities like sports i have to do all my homeworks first,have good grades at school. i Know that the activities are good for your body, normally the body always need some activities, the school always Have some activities to do and thats really good for your body. I see a lot people running by the roads like in the Summer because, it is good, for body and healthy. When i was in 10th grade i did have some activities at the gym From Generic_School and actually i did all the activities that the teachers tells to me and others students. it was very fun To do all the activities at gym from Generic_School.

602E786321EA,"Others may think otherwise, Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. Take Elon Musk for an example, he started out as a young kid who learned how to use computers but he did not stop there. Once he mastered computers he set higher and higher goals to master untill he ended up to be one of the richest man alive. I myself started with just drawing and graphic designing little art projects. then I started putting higher goals to master. Now I ended up learning how to use most of Adobe's products and doing commisions. Leonardo DaVinci was not just an artist. He was an inventer. he invented numerous of things, he had multiple skills. thats because he mastered all of these skills he set higher goals for himself and he achived them.

First examaple Elon musk. He was a bright kid. He leared how to use computers at a young age and mastered how to use them. Elon Musk did not stop there, He set higher goals to master. Elon Musk Drasticly Grew alot over the years. For and example he invented PayPal, SpaceX and Tesla. Now he is one of the riches man alive.

Second example is myself. I started out with just Drawing and graphic Designing a simple banner for my YouTube channel. then I started setting higher goals for myself to master. Now I ended up learning how to use most of Adobe's products. Doing commisions for YouTuber's and Esports teams and making money.

Last example is Leonardo DaVinci, Leoanrdo DaVinci was no ordinary artist from the Renissance Age. What made Leonardo DaVinci Stand out was that he was not a quitter infact he loved setting higher goals for himself to master. He loved growing, learning and mastering new things. Leoanrdo was not only an artist he was an inventor a scientist and that why he grew up to be one of many people biggest inspiration infact he is my inspiration. Leoanrdo was not a quiter and that's what made him grow up to be special and successful if life.

Now other may say that you dont need set higher goals to grow. But I think quite the opposite becuase if you don't set higher goals for yourself then learning new things and growing new skills would most likely be impossible unless you try to surpass your last achivement therfore you won't be able to grow and be as successful in life.

Now lets really talk about online classes, is a perfect solution for students that for some reason they cant go to school in case that they had a car accident they cant walk but they parents dont want them to fail the school year , or they dont feel like going to school thats why online classes are the best choice not only for me for a lot of people like student and parents; I mean school is not that bad at school students can make more and more friends every year online they will get tired if they have to see the same computer and hear the same voice everyday.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5

When people make a wrong desition they can mess something up in their life. That can mean the world to them like a wife/husban or his/her kids. They can set a bad influence on small kids by going to jail or by doing something a criminal might do. That is why most people go to jail and don't come out for a very long long time. That sucks to not see your mom/dad for a very long time and that can be depressing on some people.

Then if they make a good choice they won't get in trouble or get in federal trouble. that can make a good influence on your childeren and that can give them a better futer in this world. If you talk to the right person that gives you good advise. That can be a very good choice for you and your family because they won't have to see you in jail through a little window.

Just what im saying is if you mess up by talking to the wrong person you can set a bad influence on people, more family and that would suck to see your chidren and wife through a little window in a prison trust me I have been through it all. if you get in bad trouble you can probubly fix it and just get a ticket, fin, or mistimener you can fix it dont make the wrong choice and get in trouble do what you think is the best for you and your family. Don't think bout other just worry bout you and your family not anybody else

Also if you do they can take your stuff, steal money, stab you in the back and also become an turn on you, a freind is a doller in your pocket and your pocket gots a hole my mom says that to me a lot. Just do what your heart says not other people because the can get you in a lot of trouble.

my mother is the best woman in the world because she never had help of my father or other people for care me to me and my brother and with a lot effort she to achieve give them a life very good and ours show that in the life a bad moments as good people but always is united as family and help of god can out of this failures for achieve in the life ""sucess"" that each people to deserve .

For example, in this world there a lot people that are very succesful in his life is because they each pursuit his happiness, every day they wake up with a great spirits from follow to from in his life to achieve his dreams, goals and the sucess. Also can be that others days they have a bad day but always follow fighting an against always the people has that is firm in a only target that is "" Pursuit of success"". Also all the people that has sucess in the life always are very humble and respectful with it them.

In this world there always there problems for any things, but with so effort,hope, intelligence because all people has problem or failure in the life but no for this should to leave of fight , because the life to try of follow to follow because all the things has any out .

other examples is, when a student take a test and the first time not pass of test but he don't never give up, because always there a more opportunities and only should to follow study and better for that the second time should be better.

Also i have a example that i'm live in my life each day that is when a people as me,when i going to live a other country very different to mine with his way to live and it more important his language is very hard no can to communicate with them, but the beginning is very hard for any people change of country and is more hard if no know the language, but i don't give up because i know it that i'm very smart and with more effort, faith, and help of my teachers, mom and family little to little better my english and each day i learn of new things in the life because never leave of learn in the life. i disagree not can understand it and not can say nothing.

For this failure plays a role very important in ours life because show as the people has abilities for can do any things and know that all the people has intelligence for can achieve it. The failures in the life to help to better and think about that can help to better and however, i think that each people has a goal in the life and not should to renounce a ours dreams, goals that should of achieve it.

Because in the life each people to choose his destiny in the life but i think that all people has a fault but each people has of power for eliminate it of his life.

610FA0016255,"Self-esteem doesn't come from praise or achievement, In my opinion both of those are only ""supporters"" to recognize the person effort, all of about self steem really comes from ourselves, our thoughts, ideas and efforts we've done. Self-esteem is what to make you be,what you transmit, act or just to look like, that's why is really important to have that present beacuse evryone should have self-esteem.

Some people believe in praising a student's to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the student's best effort, also so meany people believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standars, I agree with this one because as humans we are, while more peole are praising us, we just will start to act maybe worngly because is too much attention.

Teachers might support students to get better as people also keep getting motivated while they're doing a test or classwork, sometimes with words to make them feel they are doing a great job but they shouldn't do that everyday because not everyone notices the value those actions has.

First, If for example there were 3 students who are very lazy but they start to do better things, the teacher will probably praise them because they made an ""effrort"" but if teachers start to do that everytime,students coul act as lack of attention even if they don't, and there is the problem, of course students must be more confident in orden to learn when they are making some efforts to do their work,however some of them just take advantege of that, when they just think because they have good grades they should to get an achievement or praises from others, even if they don't.

In addition, If in our own homes parents do teach us what's to have a good self-lesteem and how we have to be, we'll not need the approvetion ur opinion from other people and it will be enough because we'd already know how to act like, and just to think that we need an achievement or praising from someone to prove we're good on something, it's completetly wrong, you don't have to get an achievement to prove you're good on something you like it or enjoy to do.

The only thing we have to do is always make an effort, just prove to yourself you are good on something because you want to, not because you're waiting for an action from a person, also not everytime you have to get sometime to prove you are doing a good job bc you are not always to do a good job, beacuse nobody is perfect and everyone has a lot of mistakes, just do it for yourself.

Not always everything is gonna be super easy in life to us, sometimes you have to go through several situations that will make you grow as a person, every human've had self-esteem issues at least once and that's alright. I think we shouldn't depend on a opinion to get better each day for ourselves, we've to notice we are not perfect, we have mistakes and not everyone always will be cheering up us, we have to fail once or more and then just get up and keep going, with our skills and mistakes also knowing that not always we have to get something to prove our knowledged, that's where self-esteem comes from.",3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0
6186246910E1,"students should graduate in three years instead of four years.

It is better for students to graduate in three years because students will finish the career that they choose early and they will be able tho help their families.

The first reason is that students will finish the career that they choose early. students will have 1 years less to graduate. For example, a student is planning to graduate in 2021 and start his career to finish it in 2026 but now that students will be allow to graduate 1 year early then the student will finish his career in 2025. It means that the students will reach their goals early. Students can reach a better life in less time working hard with positive mind.

The second reason is that students will be able to help their families. One year less make the difference. For example, a student's mother is really sick and the student have a part time job ,but he don't gain enough money to buy his mother medicines and he have to graduate but he is still in his third year of high school so he have one more year but now that he can graduate in three years he can receive his diploma and find a full job time to gain enough money to help his mother. It means that one year less can help you change the life of your family to better. One years less can brings chances for others.

I would want to visit Ethiopia because I havent visited in over three years, lots of things has changed from then to now. But those past couple of years in Ethiopia wasn't the best for people who live there or who has family there. For Example my grandpa died a couple days after my 11th birthday and even though I didnt cry, scream, or kick that day or the day after that, it made a horrible impact on my life and my mothers. Secondly, There was a plane crash this year, more than 200 people were affected and one out of those 200 people happened to be one of my close friends. In addition to that there was a war a couple months ago that I didnt know about till a friend came up to me and said ""How do you feel about the war thats going on in Ethiopia"" I didnt know what to say because I had no clue that there was a war I felt ashamed that I didnt know what was going on in my own country. I've lost a lot of people i've cared about those past three years and I couldnt do anything about it because i was a million miles away.

Secondly, most of my family members live in Ethiopia. I hate having to talk to them on the phone and not being able to hug or see them in person, I hate having only 30 minutes to talk on the phone when I can talk to my relatives for hours in person, I hate how I am paying two dollars everyday just to talk to them when we can talk for free in person. Since I havent seen my family members in a long time I feel like I have a obligation to see them. I can get them small things from America and bring it to them, they can sell it to get lots of money because one dollar here is $30 there or they can keep it and cherish it.

Finally, Once I arrive I would want to talk to my family members, go eat Ethiopian food with them, and cherish that moment forever. I would go on long car rides because it would make some time for me and my family members to just sit and talk and have no where to go. We can go to the zoo since I never went and I would love to bond with my family members especially if its somewhere I never went before. My family members and I could have a cook out or I can just sleepover a friends house.

Base on your experience, I think is a good idea from Ralph Waldo because he is trying to convince us if we do not think before doing anything we will never grow.

Is it important to know if we do not think before doing anything we will never grow. For example, if we want to invest our money in something that is very expensive and we do not have a lot money to pay it but we insist to invest in that we are not going to get ahead. Another example is, when is almost time to pay bills we have to save money to pay them.

63AB55DADABF,"Do you think we should extend our school day? No, I think we shouldn't extend the time because we already get enough learning and our classes are long. I also don't think we should extend the time because we will be getting out of school later. If we we extend the time then we could be very exhausted during the school day. This could also be very difficult for the bus drivers because they will be getting home extremely late and it will be dark when they are driving the kids home back from school.

We get enough time in school already so there is no need to add more time the the school day. We learn enough in every class, and we learn everthing that we need to learn in that hour and a half. We learn what we have to learn and if we add time the the teachers won't really know what to do. I think we understand that they are saying and we understand the concept they are teaching us. The school day would be way longer for elementrary kids. I don't think its fair for elementray because they stay in their classes the entire day . It would be very broring because they are going to be sitting there for eight and a half hour. It would be very broing for them, because they don't get to switch classes like middle and highschool. They should also have some fun during the school day they shouldn't just sit there and high school and middle school at least get to move around while they are switching classes. They really can't do anything after school is done.

If we extend the time in school we will be at school later. Kids will be tired the next day because they wont get home until the evening. They wont pay attention to class because they didn't get enough sleep and they will not be paying close attention to what the teacher is saying because the class it too long. We will also be getting home late. Elementray kids will be getting home around 5:00pm. They won't be able to do many activities after school because they are getting home late. When they get home they will have to eat, shower, and go to sleep because they have school the next day and they deserve some fun. High school kids wake up around 5:00am and they will be at school for eight hours and then they wiil go home and do their homework. They will be tired because they don't get enough sleep and they have to wake up very early. They also can't do activities because of the homework they have and how early they have to wake up and the time they get out of school. They will get home late and they can't do much because they will have to focus on homework and school.

Extending the time could be harder for bus drivers. Bus drivers need enough sleep so that they can drive the students safely to school. Sleep is the most important and you should get at least eight hours of sleep, and that can't be possible for bus drivers because they will get home late. They all need to rest good so that they can be wide awake. If they don't get enough sleep this could lead to crashes. Crashes could happen if it's too dark and the bus drivers can't see outside. Elementray students would be getting out out around 5:00pm and around that time it will start to get dark and it isn't good for bus drivers, because they cant see if they are somewhere very dark. They also won't get to see their family as much anymore and spend time with them. They need to spend time with their family it is important to spend time with them. If they get home around eight then they will get to spend very little time with them. They have to go to sleep early because they need to wake up on time. Crashes aren't good because the parents can sue the county and that will be the countys fault because it was dark outside and maybe the bus driver couldn't really see outside.

I dissagree with adding one and a half hour to the school day. I think seven hours is enough time for a school day and to learn all the materials that we nned to know. What do you think should we add one and a half hour to our school day?         ",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5,3.5

Well in my opinion people should make there own decisions because they can decide how they want things and what makes them happy in there own way even though some would argue that, people should seek guidance from experts and authorities because some times they know whats best for us and our own health. Yes, sometimes when you seek for guidance they help you out a lot and lead you to the right path. They also, help you find whats happy but its not like if your doing it because you want your just doing it to better yourself and your not doing what you want your doing what your told.

Deciding what u want probably is what's best since your going at your own paste, your taking it how you want. your going at your own paste with things. Also, no one can stop you from doing what you believe is best for you. You can find your own ways to cope with things without anyone telling you other wise. Going at your own pace is better then getting rushed, doing what you dont want, and doing what your told even. However, getting help pushes you to do it better.

Seeking guidance isnt bad at all either you get the help you need, you get that push forward to bettering yourself. Sometimes in life there are moments where your not your best help and you need a hand. Theres nothing ever wrong with getting a little help. You sometimes need a hand to understand your values to get to recognize them and meet them.

we all have different life matters because we all dont care about the same thing. we all care about different things. your life important matters are valuable and there something that only you can decide on not any one else. Sure, our values all are different in every type of way thats the reason to why we should decide on our own why our life matters are important. thats why in my opinion people should make there own decisions, find out there matters, what there good at and what the things that they value are.",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5
642CB997325C,"Working Beyond

Do you need to work beyond what you have mastered to grow? Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. Not everyone agrees that a person can grow after they have already done what they needed. However I agree because people grow by trying new things, people succeed by trying new things, and gain more experience.

Many people grow by trying new things. When people work beyond what they know they try new things. Trying new things can help them grow in many ways. People who try new things may know their job better and work harder. In addition people will get better at what they do. They will have more experience then others and know their surroundings.

Many people may succeed when they try new things. People will become more successful. They will know what has to be done and what does not because they have worked hard and know better. In addition they will know their way around. They will not need much help because they have done the work and grew to be better.

Finally people gain more experience. When people work beyond they will be more experienced. They will have more experience then others and help others when they need the help. People will be more educated in that topic and help others.

While many people think you can not grow. There are a lot of people who are probably growing because they went beyond to learn. Unless you do not do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.

In conclusion people who go above and beyond grow because they have done more to help them grow and become better and to succeed. You should try and go beyond and see if you grown.             ",4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0
642E44E8DD25,"I would like to visit a engineering work place, or company. I would like to learn all about planning how do build something, and to they come up with good building ideas. What is the most hard part that a engineer has to take very series?.

If i was able do visit one of these companies i would get very happy. My mom told me that this is a good job, but it's a risk that people that want to have this job have to take in order do get pay very well. One of my teacher in Generic_School his dad was a engineer he told me that his dad didn't like math because it was to hard, but he got a job in the engineering company and he good checks. This teacher that i'm talking about didn't like science, or math and at the end he ended up teaching math, and science he is very good at it, and a very nice teacher too. I think all of this that i talked about is teaching me that i need to have good grades in my prealgebra class.

Engineering for me is easy do say, but i wanna experience does hard problems. On Saturdays and Sundays i work with my dad. My dads lets me cut the grass and it not easy, he keeps telling me to get good grades, so i don't have be like him all day in those hot days. I guess that working all day in a very hot summer is not food. My dad taught me that working under the sun is very hard a it makes your back hurt he told me that i need to be better them him. When i'm older i would get a good job, and i would help my dad, and my mom even dough they told me that when get older they are going to go back to El Salvador , but i'm still going to help them.

I think that i would give engineering a chance if not i'm going to find another job. thats ones of my job, or company i would like to visit if it was close to my school. Another company, or job would be frying airplanes i is good job i o ways wanted to fly one, but its do hard plus i don't think i'm going to go to college i think that this jobs are just to hard for me to learn especially me it take a long time for me to remember something. I think i can make it if only i put mu effort on it. My teachers tell me that i'm smart only when i want to, they o ways tell me to give it a try and i o ways ended up learning it sometimes i think that teachers sometimes understand students and hoe they feel. I get mad when don't understand something. i haven't done good in 7, and 8th grade. I think that all of these happen because i made new friends. I think that flying airplanes is much harder then learning engineering, but the only thing i need to do if put my effort in everything

I think that is not a bad idea do have some company around schools they should make field trips, kids could ask question that they would like to ask. This essay made me think more about what job would i like to do in the future. I think that i would stay with the engineering job i would like to put all my thoughts in to it and get a good college degrees, and get the job that i dream off. I think that my dream wold come true, and if it does or doesn't well i guess i would learn another thing i pay to go to college and get that job. i will try to make all my family happy and help all of them. I'm really good in everything if i only put my mind into it.

In my school we join sports and some after school classes and if we join some sports or some activities after school we have credits and it add up to your grades and people doesn't want to participate because they're lazy and sometimes they make up stories that the have headache, sick, stomach ache, and just skipping after school classes. And sometimes they fail some classes and teachers wants to convince them to join and stay after class and make their grades up.

I have a friend that is a bit of a trouble in school his name is Generic_Name he ask me if I could help him do his work and I said to him that "" You can join activity classes at social studies, or stay after school, and it makes your grades high and you can learn something "" And he didn't followed me, and thats why he still have one F on Social Studies.

If I was the principal I would make every students join sports and make them stay after school for those school activities, and if they have like an F in one class or a missing assignment I would call their parents and ask the parents if their child can stay after class and make their bad grades or missing assignment gone and make their grades higher and get extra credits for participating for after school activities.

And if I was the student I can convince them by letting students know if they have problems on their work or missing assignments I would let them convince to join the after school activities or stay after to do some retakes on their test or quizzes and figure out what is wrong with their grades and fix them and make their grades high. And those who doesn't want to join the after school activities will remain have an F for the 2nd quarter.

The best thing is for the students who want to try or join the team for basketball, tennis, badminton, baseball, hockey, and wrestling is the best thing because few students always wants to join or try for the team. And my two friends join for basketball and hockey my one friend named Generic_Name wants to try out for baseball this spring season and he is really good at basketball and baseball, but the only wrong for him is he has bad grades. I know that students should have good grades before you try out for the team. Generic_Name made a decision to stay after class and do the retakes and after 3 weeks Generic_Name has good grades and he try out for baseball and made the team.\

I agree that students should participate to after school classes or sports. Even me I stayed after school just to finish my work or do some retakes and get a better grade this year.

The idea of extending the school day would case cognitive impairment, For example, When my friend got sleepy for doing a school project late last Kite he would constantly forget he had homework and always feel uninterested in doing stuff, When I got tired I have forgotten to check the time that I had to get to work.

The plan would case students not having inf time for their jobs after school. For instance, When I had to stay after school for a test I had to miss work, and my manager had to cut my pay for messing work, Because i had to stay after school I lost my chains to get paid for my hard work.

Some people say that the plane would give students a four-day week than are five-day week.

Student need to be able to take class out of the school. Some student will need to take class in summer school. For some student is more difficult to graduate early because they need work for help in theirs houses. For make this possible student must need to be; determine, preparete, and flexible.

Student that try to graduate early they must need to be determine. they need to be determine for be able to past all their class an exams. and example is; ""I have a friend that is graduate early and she is taking class in the evenings"". Student that are determine is going to be more easy to finish high school early. Yet if you are planing to go to college is a good idea to graduate early.

Student that try to graduate early they must need to be preparate. They need to be preparete to take more class during school year. They need to be preparete to have a full skehchule and not be able to take elective class. they need to prepare because they maybe need to take class during summer. They need to be prepare to pass all their class and exams that they need for graduate early and not to stress out.

Student that try to graduate early they must need to be flexible. Sometimes you have to be flexible for what you have to do like if you work and go school if you try to graduate early you have to be able to stop working and focus just in school. Students need to be flexible for new things and face in the best way. Like if you find difficult in one of your class you should ask your teacher for help. Student need to be flexible because if they take class in the evening or online is going to be different and maybe difficult for them but they need to be able to find a way to be successful.

First People on your environment influence a lot because in front of them you decide who you want to be and you choose your traits so i think that you choose your traits on the type of environment that you are on on you are living for Example My brother Generic_Name when he was around me he was a different person we talked like brother help each other as brothers when he was around Dad And mom he was another type of person he was not the same with me he was more kinder but when we were on school he another type of person he was mean He didnt care about me and other people he wouldn't treat me he changed his traits to a whole different level That proves that a person can changes their traits depends on the environment that they are growing.

second people who we talked too we eventually we change our way to be to different people the way that we talk to our people are a different person when u talk to your relatives friends coasins brotheres we eventually changed the way to be for example one day A guy named Generic_Name recived a call from his parents saying Generic_Name its time to come home And Generic_Name respectfully said Tes mom i will go home right Away after he finish his call he talked to us saying Dude i need to leabe but like right now!! screming that proves that we change the way that act with different people or the way that we talk with different types of people.

It be the best option for students because it will give them more time to experience, learn new information in a young age. We all as a student need more time to prepare for future, and work as hard as possible to pass our classes. Furthermore, same for the teachers, they will be able to have more time with their families; and they can enjoy their lives with three days weekend. My school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours because teachers and students will have more time to relax,

to grow and achieve more, and to help others.

We all need to relax, specially if we are a student because school is so stressful, and two days weekend will not give enough time to students to relax. Two days weekend will just be enough for students to spend time with their families and do their homework; it will not give them time for themselves. Moreover, by two days weekend students can not relax and work for themselves. I personally rather to have more time during the weekend because I will have more time to finish everything that I wanted to do during the week, and I will have time to relax. During the weekdays students can learn more and they will have more time in school to spend with their friends. Some people think that three days weekend will make students forget what they learned during the week. But they are wrong because students will have more time to go over what they learned, and they have enough time to practice more.

Most of the people loves to exercise, read, meditate, and swim in their free times. Three days weekend will give students and teachers more free time to care about themselves. Most of my friends love to exercise, but some of them gave up on exercising because they don't have time to do it. They are working Saturdays' and studying on Sundays'. One of my teachers told me, that she loves to read book in weekends, but she does not have time to read because she has a lot of work to do. Reading, exercising, meditating, and swimming will help human to grow and learn more to achieve more. Also, four days weekdays will teach students to work harder. Some people think that students and teachers should not have longer weekend than usual because they have winter break, and spring break. But they are wrong because longer weekend can help both students and teachers to care more about themselves by giving them free time.

Some of the students love to help others, by volunteering. Three days weekend will increase students chances to help others because they will have more time to do it. My sister loves to volunteer and help other; she is volunteering once a month. She told me that she wants to increase it and do it more, but she can not because she has a lot of homework and she does not have time. Although, their are a lot of students who need help in some of their classes because they have a bad grade. If we give the students more time to study, they will get better grades. Last year during winter break, my math teacher told me that I have to try harder and study more, I told him that I can not understand the notes. We met in the public library and he helped me to study. He said, ""I love to help students outside of school, but I don't have time to do it"". I think we have a lot of teachers like that, who wants to help students outside of school, but they don't have time. If we have longer weekends, teachers will be able to help more students. Some people think that schools should have two days weekend because they are not getting tired. But they are wrong teaching and learning are the most hardest things in the world.

6C802D3F5F2A,"One topic that is frequently debated is ""Does true self-esteem come from praise or does it come from achievement"". Some people think, that praise that is given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. They believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement. I believe that the source of true self-esteem is by praising a student's work because that could help them grow more independent. By praising a student's work, they are going to be able to; work efficiently independent, have a bigger self confidence, and learn better.

First reason, When a student's work is praised that helps them achieve there work more efficiently. It emphasizes that they are capable of working independent and being able to have a good job. When some one is praised for their work, it makes them feel good and makes them want to do more work. A student's work should not get praised for their work if they didnt put any effort in the work because that would just make them want to not put any effort in the work, because they will think that they would get the same grade as someone that actually tried and actually wanted to get a good grade for something that they put so much effort into.

Second reason, When a student has a big self confidence that helps them get their work done more constant and with more effort because they know that they can do it and that are capable of having a good grade. when a student is willing to put a lot of effort into the work. their work should be more praised. praising a student's work can help them have a by self confidence, which can help the students learn more. when a student is willing to learn that is the true motivation that is considered being able to achieve more work and do it more efficiently and with more confidence.

Third reason, When a students is willing to learn a lot and are always on track, paying attention, and turning in work on time. and always putting a lot of effort in school, those kinds should always be recognized and praised, because they show how mature they are and how willing they are to graduate and have a good job. If a student is willing to learn and put a lot of effort in work, that makes them mature because it shows how willing they are to learn. other students dont care if they graduate or not because for them being ""popular"" and not listening to the teacher, and disrupting the class and doing what ever they want it more important than learning and getting an education.

Having a strong self confidence, being independent and willing to learn more are some examples of praising a student's work. when a teacher shows an appreciation to their students it shows that they care about them and it shows that they are willing to help them carry on and push them forward and being their when they need it, and that makes the students want to go to class everyday and want to learn because the teacher is fun and knows how to work with students very well. and that is why it is good to praise a student's work.

I would swim at a beach so I could feel the fresh water. I would also climb the mountains to feel the fresh air. I would want to sigh see at the top of a mountain.

I could find coconut and banana on a tropical tree. I could also find crayfish in the water and other fish. If you catch a crayfish or regular fish I would fry it. If there is a variety of foods then I could change my eating style while I am there.

Lastly I would go to Jamiaca because there are different types of animals. I would probably find chickens or other birds that fly or run. Also I could find stray dog that roam around the streets. I would like to find fish that have claws or fish that have fins. I might find frogs that are poisonous and ones that are not. I think I could find goats roaming around eating peoples plants.

6CDE42A3FA9F,"People think sometimes that influencing means you have to be an example for the person, but in my opinion influencing someone could be through anything like : internet, words, a friend and even family. I disagree with Albert Schweitzer because he said,  Example is not the main thing in influencing others ; it is the only thing.

First reason why I think an example is not the only way to influence people. For example, I go to a party and there are people under the age of twenty-one drinking alcohol, they do not have to be someone I know for them to influence me to drink alcohol. Some people would feel pressure to do it just because the other ones are doing it.

Second reason why I think an example is not the only way to influence others. The tv can influence people to buy thing from the commercials, it could be anything. People sometimes do not think about how much money they spend on stuff; at the and of day they use it once, and then forget about it.

On the other hand, people think that the only way to influence someone is by an example. In addiction, my mom is someone that consider as an example for me, if she do soemthing wrong it doesn't mean that I am going to do it, too. I think being an example is something good as long as you don't do what they did wrong.

In conclusion, I think there are more ways to influence people. It could be you influencing someone else or someone influcing you.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5
6D06DAD5446C,"I agree that people should get the help, so they can make great decisions. Because the other person could probably be wrong with somethings. Also the other person doesn't have any saying in your life, if you don't want them to. And you are the only person who can change the outcome of your life. even so your the main person in your life, its okay to hear others out even though they are wrong sometimes or if they are sometimes right.

The first reason is that its okay if you don't want the other person's help. But you should hear them out so you can get something out of thing. For example my friend Generic_Name, she love to write stories and love to sing, and dance, but she too embarrassed to do what she love. So one day I gave her some ideas, but she didn't want any, because she don't want to do them, but next day, she gave some of my ideas a try and she like it but still don't want to do it anymore. But long as she listened that good enough for me.

The second reason is people don't have any saying in your life, yes its true, but theres people willing to help you through your life. But it only depend on you, if you want their help or not. For a example my sister Generic_Name doesn't want help from me nor our parents. But its okay, because she know that we want to help her, because we care about her,so we will not stop trying to help her. But there is times she let us help her out with her life, and that's good. Longs she lets us in her life, thats good enough for us.

Last reason is you still are the main person in your life, so no matter what you do your life, just remember it your life is your alone, and you are the only one who can change the outcome of your future. even If you want the help of others or not. For example I'm 18 years ago, and i'm still having problems in my life, but there are people that are willing to help me, but i'm scared at no matter what i'm still feeling down with stuff. But no matter what they are still willing to help me. And i'm happy, so yeah thats good for me.

So basically, NO MATTER WHAT THERE'S ALWAYES WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WANTS TO HELP YOU. So its good to get some advice and wisdom from others. even though you don't want the help, its still good to get some advice from others.",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5

6DA4157C9B4F,"Many people believe that self-esteem comes from achievement.

They believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement.

True self-esteem comes from achievement because accomplishing a goal pushes you to try harder, help you praise yourself, and it is a long lasting satisfaction for you to remember.

Accomplishing a goal pushes you to try harder.

This is important because achievements comes from all your goals you have accomplished and that helps you want to try harder and to achieve many other goals you might have that you want to achieve.

This helps you build self-esteem by making you feel good for what you have accomplished.

Also since it makes you feel good it helps you want to accomplish other things because it makes your self-confidence grow stronger.

Also achievement helps you praise yourself.

What this means is praising yourself inspires you to continue to do many other things.

Praising yourself keeps you wanting to keep on achieving your goals.

It is like an inspiration because you know that after any achievement you are going to praise yourself and that is going to make you feel good.

So praising yourself makes you have a higher self-esteem by helping you feel good within yourself.

Moreover, achievement is a long lasting satisfaction.

For example, you have jsut achieved a goal you've had for three years now it makes you feel very satisfied that you finally made it.

Eventhough some may think satisfaction on something you achieve is not important you should because satisfaction with yourself makes your self-esteem go up.

satisfaction is a result of an achievement and a achievement helps you be more confident with yourself.

Achievement is the key to higher self-steem because it pushes you to try harder, helps you praise yourself a little more, and it is a long lasting satisfaction for you to remember.

If you want to have higher self-steem then achievement is the key.                   ",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.5,4.0

The time we live on right now students should get projects over the summer, so they can prepared for college and other things in life this is why the schools are giving them work so they dont forget about school and keep learning everyday. While some people around the world say that teachers should design the summer project for the students. It is better for the students to design their own summer project because they have better ideas, Can make their projects less stressful, and make it more fun with their friends.

All students in the world have better ideas to how to design your own project and make it better. Students have better understanding of what they want to do for there project like having better ideas and knowing what they want to work on. Cristiano Ronaldo wrote a article about why is good students should design their projects and why teacher should let them design their own article. Cristiano Ronaldo is a soccer star but he went to high school and know what the students want to do and design. He wrote on the article that students brain is still developing;he said that if students keep making their own decision and teachers let them choose their designs of projects they can come up with better ideas that other people cannot even think about. In the article he wrote that we students have a amazing brain and we can come u with the best ideas and design of projects that no one else can't. Everyone keep saying that teachers should make the designs of students projects for the summer.

Students of everywhere can make there project design less stressful if they get to choose what they can do. When students get to design there own project is less stressful for them because they can choose how they want to do it.

Leonel Messi came to every high school in the united states to talk about how stressful is when teacher give students projects over the summer. They make us work super hard and is super hard to communicate with their teacher over the summer. He talk to us that picking our own projects is way better than teachers picking the design because we can make our own ideas and it is less stressful and that is going to be easier. When students pick their design they don't need to worry about asking question to their teacher and stressing out. Messi told us that when he was in high school,he used to choose his own design of project because it was less stressful and more fun to do. when people keep saying that teacher should choose our design it so stressful because us as student want to choose our design for our summer project.

People in all high schools keep saying that is more fun for students to make our design of project ,because it makes our studies more fun and incredible. The mother of my friend ones told me that there is nothing more fun than getting to design a project as a student. She told me that when she was in high school their teacher choose the project for them and that wasn't fun for no student. That's why she told me that is more fun to get to choose your own design of project because when teachers get to choose them is super boring and stressful students sometimes cry. She told me that If i had the chance to make my own design to take it because it was not going to be fun to if the teacher choose the design. It is going to be more fun if you get to choose your own design for the summer project because i can get to make it with my friends and probably family members. Never let your teacher choose design the summer project for the students.

While other people might say that these summer projects should be teacher designed because the student keep learning more and keep working hard;however, if students make their own summer project design it is way better because student have better ideas, less stressful, and get to have more fun while doing the project. Messi gave us a great talk about how to choose your own design of project can make every students less stressful.

6E70CECCE25D,"One topic is frequetly debated is whether or not should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? some people think that because students can learn more. They feel that because if the school extending two hours more, we can have more time with our friends. I believe that because you can do homework,expending time with your friends, and learn more.

One reason why the school days can extending two hours is because alot of students need help with their clases,teachers can help us to pass the clases and that it is good time the students think about, if they want to graduated they can make an effort to pass the clases and don't distracted other people in the classroom. Students have bad grades because they don't listening to the teacher while she's explain. We have bad grades because the class is boring or the teacher is great with the students and she don't say anything when we are using our phones.

Second reason why the school days can extending two hours is because you can participated in school activities or, you can play in some games like Soccer, American football, basketball, and you can have more time with your friends and helping the soccer team. you can help to clean the school and decoring some of the classroom, or you can stay in the library and help to organized the books or doing homework, and we can use the computers to search and find what book we want read.

Third reason why the school days can extending two hours is because some students want to stay in the school doing projects or homework because they don't have time to do in their home some of they go to work, and others students have alot of homework from the others clases, and that's one reason why the teachers be mad with the student because they did not do his homework, and the students explain why he not did that homework we have alot of homework from the others clases and i don't have to much time to do all the homework i have because at night i got to the bed early and the next day some teachers give me more homework and that's why i don't do your homework.

The last reason why the school days can extending two hours is because some students need help with their homework, they need to practice more to understand the class but the most important thinks that students need to have are good grades and pass all the test to graduated, if they have very good grades the school will give a certificated to saying we are proud of you, and your family will give to you some gifts because they are proud of you ,and you will graduated without trouble and then any university will accept to you because they will see your grades of your colleges and see how good you was in your clases.

First ,every student have something they like to do, so students can join a club or an activity after school. If the school board adds one and a half hours to school each day, students will attend their activities late. The activity lasts about 2 hours or later, students may get home after the sun sets up. In the winter ,the sun sets up so early, the day is short, it's too dangerous for the students who walk home.

Second, we have about seven hours in the school every day, I think we need more time to study at home. It's quiet when we study at home. Students can use these time fully. We can learn new knowledge, do sports, review everything we learn, and so on. However, there are some new students from different countries, they can not speak English very well,they need more time to study. So, I think it's not good to expend the school day.

Lastly, if the school board will not expend the school day, it can not only help us do what we want to do for a long time ,but also let us have a long and good sleep. We have a lot of homework in the high school, we may finish homework late. It's not good for students. The students in the high school must sleep for about eight hours every day. If they do not sleep very well at night, they will not have good mentality to study next day, their grades may decline.

6EF7CBB46501,"The statement that the author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote about to do something else just to be someone in the world, it is completely an error. I disagree with this statement, since, I believe that every person think differently. For example, people has their own ideas and ways how to do their own business. Everyone can make a biggest impact in the world, but, by doing what they love. Not what others think that it could be beneficial for you. To be someone in a world you should believe in yourself, make right decisions, and success.

First of all, people could enter in your mind by telling you what could be beneficial for your life or carer. Some of them accept their opinion and do what they do not like, or love. For example, when students are thinking in what career they want to study. Parents influence in their choices by telling about what career would be properly for them. However, those ""properly careers"" it is not in their list of careers they want to study. This action make some teenangers to take that step of let parents choice by themselves.

Otherwise,

they do not help them to mature or even take responsabilities. Everyone should believe in themselves by doing whatever they love, without any interpose in accomplish their dreams. Since, we have the right to build them, it does not matter if we commit an error. Because of our capacities to avoid them or even get over it and keep going.

People has the right to make big choices in life. Making decisions it is hard and important because it could be beneficial, or even worst. However, if you choice with your heart it might be right but by the time you can change your mind. But, you won't regret it about those decisions because as they say, ""You have to learn for every error you commit to be success."" This means that we learn through the past of the time every fall, because you have to stand up and continue your life. It helps us to growing our knowledge to build a better version of ourselves.

Finally, by being confidence to yourself helps you to surpass any obstacle. Beliving in your ideas and trying to make it come true, it tells us that you are persist person chasing for your dreams. Which is quite favorable for person in any career or even job. Because of seeking to be successful at your own way, by do not depend about what others can say. Everyone has a differently perspective than others by doing what you love without any ""obligation"" or to be oppresed.

In conclusion, I am not accorded by this statement, since, we have different points of view. However, I believe that every human being can make their dreams come true without any oppression by others. People should stand by themselves by starting to be confidence in their belief. Also, by being patience on making important decisions, since, everything takes time.

The way I see people using technology its good cause it a lot easier to organize important documents , shop online , doing homework for school and everyday technology will always advance each day.

The only problem thats bad about technology its that us humans getting distracted easily by using our phones , playing games on console , and getting distracted easily. Theres always gonna be a bad and good towards technology it all the depends how humans use it.

Technology is the best thing we have in our world. It makes life more easier for us to do stuff online. Technology will be there for us when we need it to organize documents , buy stuff online , and it will always advance. technology will always have a positive and negative side to it but most of the time its positive. it all depend how humans use it. thats what I think about my side technology the bad and the good.

70B91D253E27,"I think that it's a bad idea to put more hours of school beacause after school people,students and teachers have to do important stuff like take there kids to soccer or go to a doctors appointment and thats the only time that we have free to do are important missions and there are teacher's that live far they could live in Generic_City and other places that are far. And if we make it longer there are going to be parent's that are going to be waiting for there child to take them to the football, soccer games and then when they come home its going to be late beacause like they want to change the hours they are not going to have enough time to do anything there going to go home to homework and then when you know it it arleady like 8pm and you have to go to bed. And we arleady wake up at 7am and then coming back home and it's like 5pm-6pm it's stress out kicking out stuff that you do but now you can't to beacause they put more time in School.

And i think it sucks beacause there are kids that go to my school that live in Generic_City and it take along time to come to school and go back home from school beacause i've lived in Generic_City before and it suck when i stay after school i get home like at 7pm-8pm and it's sucks so it better to not make school longer beacause there are kid that live pretty far and there are going to get home late and then they have to get there homework done too. so it's dummy hard work to get that on time. And us as chidren its going to ruined are shecdule and are parent's to maybe we have not go to soccer or any activity that we take just beacause they put more time in school it going to suck being in a class room for 80 mintues now. it's to be trieding.

They meant if we get a half an hour of more school they start giving us more homework then we mostly get and doing that for just 3 hours that we get just beacause they want to add more time it's going to be hard for everybody and they teacher if they live far it's going to be hard beacause at 6pm thats when all rush hour are so much traffic and there going to come home late and when they come home late there going to be grading work and then waking up at 5pm to go back to work and that trieding doing that smae rountine for there whole life it hard I dont even go to work and i'm like wow if that happens it going to be bad.

Another thing that why would should have on more half an hour is beacause we wake up early and have another half hour kicking ints not far if they want to do that they should a least change they school time and wake up like at 8am or something beacuase its not far wake up early and then leaving so late it should be the oppsite wake up late and leave school early it going to be better beacause then everybody going to kbe happeir no one is going to be in a bad mood and it's going to be chill and then .

Anothe thing way we should have an half an hour of school left it's beacause we the 8th grader we get lunch at 1:40 and then haveand half and hour of school were going to have lunch at 2:10 or something I arleadly hate that and i dont wanna be starving beacause then i wont to my work beacause how hungry I i'm going to get mad i'm going to get hangry and having busdriver taking the kid home at 6pm its going to suck beacause they need there time too for they could do stuff and have time with there family's and there going back and forth it sucks for them having ti puck up kids late and stuff and taking them home.",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5
70E490A83717,"To begin with many students enjoy summer than winter. Making winter break longer than summer and a week off in spring and fall is not a good idea. When students come back from break regardless of the season they most likely cannot retain information, because they have been gone for a long period of time. Having a longer winter break than summer is a waste of time. Why should educators feel that a longer winter break than summer could help retain information?

In my point of view having a longer winter break would not be enjoyable students like the fact that they can be able to enjoy their break. Even though students cannot retain information on learning targets, at least it wont waste time because having a longer winter than summer would extend time causing time to be lost in the school year. Changing the season of the break would not be enjoyable either cause of cold weather, it would certainly not help students to remember the information they learned when they were in school. Whats a break if you cannot enjoy it?

In addition what maybe the students can take into consideration is to review some of the things learned, during the free time on their break. Teachers should assign online classes and review's for students to help memorize information at least once a week. That way when people return to school others wont be so behind on things and can remember the objectives taught. A longer winter break could possibly help the scholar remember what was learned, if they were to revise and analyze work that was given to in the past in this situation.

In conclusion changing the season would not help students retain information and is not a good idea , unless the individual were to spend time studying a few times out of the break. Overall there should not be a longer winter break than summer.

7203112033A1,"Hello my name is Generic_Name and I am here to tell you why I think, distance learning is a good idea, rather then a bad idea. I will be giving you three diffrent points of view, and why it wouldn't be a bad idea for some of us. My first opinion on distance learning would be, maybe he or she gets bullied for the classes they take and dont want to be in school no more. My second opinion would be if your not in school range and your parents can't drive you to school on time, then you could easily stay home, pull out your phone, computer, or tablet and do you work on it. My third opinion would be why not try it you know maybe you'll like it.

1 OPINION: Everyone one knows school is very hard for everyone, nowadays school is based off of how you dress, or the way you walk, or just in general who you are. I used to get bullied in school a lot but ever since I switched to online school I've never felt better I get all my work done, the teachers are so nice to me, there very patient and polite, and I dont have to put up with nobody's crap from school. It was a good switch for me, and it'll be a good switch for you too!

2 OPINION: Every where you live there is always one problem, school range. I know its hard for everyone to find a ride to school or maybe it isn't, but say one day you move and u can't find a ride to school the next week and you dont have a ride cause your parents can't take you cause they're running late for work, or you just missed the bus and your house is to far from the school. Well that's why you've been given the option for online school. Would you take it ? I would because iw ouldn't have to stress on trying to get up on time, and trying on clothes for school, or finding something to eat all in a rush. I love online school cause i can get up at whatever time i want to. I wouldn't ave to make my parents late for work every now and then. Also you can start your assignments on your time, say like your not busy u can start it then but you have to do them because there are new assignments everyday. So think about it for a minute and see why it might be a good option for you.

3 OPINION: Why not just try it. I think you guys or girls, or whatever should give it a try because not everyone has the privilege to have sort of secondary learning challenge I think that if your try it just like I did. The price for online school is around from 150-200 dollars, I know it might sound a little exspensive but its worth every penny you spend. So dont hesitate to try it you'll love it.

In conclusion I think it is a good thing to do distance school because it gives you benefits you've never gotten before and it might turn out to be the best decision you ever made in your son, or daughter life. So dont hesitate to call, call right now if you can I love it and they will to.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0

I See no problem not a big essue about using cell phones at school,a lot of students need the cell phones to stay informed or to keep in contact with the parents,students can use cell phone in case of an emergency at school. Cell phones are a safe thing for the students at this times. Some students don't have a way to search a subject or a problem because they don't have a computer with,so the cell phone is faster, and small easy to look through,share ideas with other students,point of view about a subject,political opinions,stay informed what is going on outside of school,students have to be informe about everything that happens outside of school,bloquing students devices can cause a bad effect and this will make then find other way to brake the rules again,and get what they want .I think students should be allowed to use cell phones for this reasons.

However, some students can take to other side,and don't pay atenttion in class because of the cell phones,a big part use cell phones to play games,or get distracted with music,and this can affect a lot of other students in the class,use to much of the cell phones also affect the social midia. Using social midia at school can cause a bad point of view of the school,examples of it can be recording fights, or sexual things. Most teachers don't allow studenst using cell phone during class because students can be out of the subject that the teacher is trying to teach,this can be a rock inside the boot.

72A69C1B34A8,"I think students should have the opportunity to choose their own classes as electives rather than taking a class in the arts because if they were assigned to a class they know nothing about then that would be setting them up for failure and I do strongly believe that is not the right way to go about things especially in the school district. We cannot let the students fail because it is important to have something to look forward to when they arrive to school. It is a definite requirement for students to take classes such as music, drama, and art however, it would be fair to let them decide on their own behalf. Once a students picks the class they would hopeful and full of joy to attend to it everyday. I believe that no matter what a student can decide what they believe in and have no dought about it. The students should have the ability to be successful in school if they put their minds into it.

Although if the counclours put students in the classes they dislike in my opinion, the student will most likely not attend to the classes they were assigned to. Furthermore It would be appropriate to encourage students to choose the right fit class they would want to enroll in. I challenge you to go through with this action to let the students decide on their own.

in conclusion, given this opportunity for the students it will increase the satisfaction rate and expand on more ideas for the school in the future.

But I think the online class is not benefit for the students because they can not learn better maybey the students they can not consentrate good at home becuase they distrate for something and they cannot learn about the lesson and maybe the teachers they cannot teach good however on the schools the students they cannot distrate and they put attention when the teachers theach the lesson better however they force the students to put attention because the teacher wants their students learned.

However some people they don't have the opportunities to going to schools but they pay a class for online maybe they work the all day and they wants to studies, for example, the hispanic people they work immigrant to this country but the work hard to pay the rent and other bills but some people they wants to learn English to have a better wrk so for the reason they pay for online class becuase thyey wants to learn other language or they wants to have a better job so for the reasons is benefit for they pay for online class however not everyone have the same oppotunities.

The school is very important but some students doest like the school and some students like the school becuase they want to do someone on the future so if the students wants to do something on the fututre they need to have a dreams because the person doest have a dreams they don due anything because we can take the opportunities to the parents give to their childrens becuase some childrens on the world they wants to have any opportunity.

For example: Play outside with friends, go to libraries, and stay outside with natural. Some people say the kids have to have limitation of what they doing on they computer or cells phones. On the other side people say that is good for teenager having not limitation because they can learn more. I think teenager need a limitation of what they doing in the phones. Furthermore parents should cheking what they doing in the internet.

However, some people think is good for teenager not having a limitation because they learn more for their future. On the other hand some people say that that tenenager can't complete a taskd with out having contact with other person. I thinbk having a conversition with other is good because you get to know that person and also get stronger the relationship. When you meet a strager in the internet is dangeous, not everyone is a good person. Some parents think that the kids are just playing in the internets but they do not. I think having a conversiation to you or playing games without speaking I think that have a limitation until you know well that person.

In addition, sometimes people used to buy alot of things from the internet without knowing that person, that is dangerous. People that are seeling on wedsides that always offer what the really have or maybe they just want the money. If you going to buy anything for the internet just make sure the wedside is safes. Buying staff for the internet is getting wrong because people do not want to go aout and spend time with family. Since wedsides liike Amazon, Ebay, and others came up people atart get all they need from wedside. Bad people are used this on favor to them, they are creating so many fake wedsides to racket people.

To continue with, I think a good way to get the kid out the technology is take them to have fun outside like hand out with friends, having friends in a computer like into a videogame or a social media is not healty for the kids. You have to get to know the person before play or talk to them. Sometimes people trick the kids ask them to do bad things.

Enthusiasm is everything you need, when you want to strar something, without enthusiasm we can have a lot of failure if we don't try again and again, it is like the main function of your brain, your personality, and your attitude, to don't have any failure in your life, someone with a great enthusiasm is someone with many opportunities in his life, someone with a good control about what he wants and what he does, someone who doesn't give the opportunity to fail in what he is doing, failure will be always right there in from of you, but your are the only one who accept it or not.

An example of failure can be, ; like when someone went to ask for a job but, he doesn't had the job because he didn't finish the high school that is failure in his life, but he decide to retake the high school in his free time, and he graduate from it, he can back for ask in the same job, he is contracting at this time it was because he has a great enthusiasms in his life, he never stop because he didn't had the job at his first try he continue and he did it.

I know not everything is rose color but sometimes you need a little bit of failure in your life, to see how brave you are and how strong are you for the life situations, failure it's not mean that you are a loser, not it's mean that you are training for the difficult situations in the life but with just a good enthusiasm you can do it again and again has many times you want to do that is my conclusion about how failure can affect your life.",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5

76C2E20AF20E,"When you were in high school would you have commit the career you have now?

Many people do know what they want to do for their career, but others do not. In my opinion committing to a career at a young age is not a good idea. There are many people that choose a career at a young age, and now years later, they are not happy or they get bored. A lot of high school students do not know what they want to have as their career. It is also a lot of pressure for students to figure out what they want to do for the rest of their lives.

When students go to high school , some of them want do explore different class to figure out what exactly, they want to do as their career. For example , I am in the 11th grade, and I still have not committed to a career. In the last 2 years, I was able to see what I might want to commit to and ones I do not have interest in. Some might say they want to be a doctor, lawyer, or even a teacher. But many might not go for that career in the future . Maybe it is because they found a different career that they love but figured it out at a different age.

I see some people that are over 30, and are not happy with the career they committed to at a young age. They do not like going to work as much. Also when they committed to a career, they could have through it was totally different . But when they started to study for that career ,it was a little to late because they committed to it. When I am older , I want to be at least a little happy with what I have my career as.

In the other sides opinion, I do see why committing to a career at a young age is pretty important too. It is better to have students study what career they want to commit to , so they can start to studying for it . Then they can start to expand their career at a young age. If I knew what career exactly I wanted to commit , I would have been taking classes for that specific career in high school. It always good to know what you want to study for at a young age, so you do not have to worry about it in the future.

Students still not knowing what to commit to and having to commit to a career that the students might not like in the future are my two main supports to my opinion. I choose these two, because I think it supports my opinion the best. Students can always figure out what career they want in college , they do not have to know right away . Its a big part of a students life to commit to some thing they are going to be doing as their career. But it is always a pretty good idea to know what career you want to do at a young age.

You are changing school policy so student that have a C average can not participate in sports or other activities unless the students have at least a B average .I think that students that have a C average should at least have an extra class that they need help in so they can pull up their grades up so the students can participate in sports or activities. If the teachers of the student think that they are working hard to bring their grades up at least the principal should give the students 30 minutes of free time on the activities or sports they want to participate in.

The school should make a contract saying that students that have a C average cant participate in sports or activities. The parents ,teacher ,principal ,and the student should sign the contract .The students that don't even try to work hard to get a B average should stay an hour after school to catch up the work they have been missing. the students that don't recognized that what their doing is wrong and they don't get privileges like other students do.

Although student get to proud and tend to over do the work, giving the student praise always comes out to be better than what they actually expected to achieve. Giving students praise always makes students feel good. Praising students who fail always has a different outcome the second time they do the task been giving.

Giving the students praise always comes out to be better than what they were expecting;for example,a student who was doing bad before you praised them realized what the purpose of the work was and put all their effort into the work. Therefore, the work being produced was very productive.

Praising a student builds their self esteem by making them feel good about the work that has been done. Which means if they feel very good and proud of the work thats been done the work that will be produce will be very creative and outstanding.

Praising students who produce deficient work encourages them to produce better the next time work is been given to them. Therefore,the student knows that someone is always there to encourage them when needed.

In conclusion,praising students always tend to make them do better. In that case if the students feels good their work will be better.         ",3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5

also don't you want extral help when you need it? students are the same they want help on schoolwork and homework cause it could be difficult.

students don't really like difficult homework, so they give up and do something else, but with a homework club they can go afterschool and do the work there teachers can help students out.

for example I sometimes need help, so I have a teacher that helps me at home with my work and my parntents has to pay that teacher. and some parntants don't have the money to pay for a teacher, so if we can work togather to make a club that helps out students that would be great for the students, and the parntents would not have to pay alot of money to make they child good at school.

a other example would be that students can stay afterschool with there teachers, but for a little bit of time, so if were going to have a homework club lets make it more than 47 minumies. More time equlas a lot of work getting compled.

in conclusion we need a homework club it can help out a lot of students and save a lot of pernts money, and also make stundents pass more tests and help tham on schoolwork, and make students feel like difficult work is easy since they got all the help they need from the afterschool club, also if some teachers don't feel like staying for another they could just let the students help each other and let the teacher rest.

This idea has an advantage and on the other hand a disadvantage because student will be stress out, some will not get enough time to rest before going to work,and they wont get time to learn.

First,students will be stress out. There are different kind of people in a school,some may be fine when it comes to sitting for a longtime,others may have problems. Sitting down for more than three hours can cause waist and back pain. some students may be sleeping while the teacher is teaching. Example;if a teacher is teaching and the students are sleeping,the student will end up not hearing what the teacher said about the topic. When this happens,the student will end up failing the class which is not suppose to happen.

Again,most of the student will not get enough time to rest after school before going to work. There are a lot of students in high school who work and cater for their living. Majority work after school,therefore,they have enough time to rest before going to work. If the school hours is extended by two hours,they will not have enough time to rest and will be sleeping later in the day in class. Example;some people do not close early when they go to work,those student get a little time to rest before going to work.

This idea is important because,it will help teachers to complete their syllabus in time and also rest on the fifth day,and get time to be with their kids. some subjects involves a lot and needs much time to complete. Teachers always rush when they are teaching just to catch up the syllabus and students will not understand the concept they are teaching but when two hours is added to the time,the teacher will take her time to explain for the students to understand the concept very well.

I will conclude by saying,adding two hours for a four-day week school has a lot of disadvantages,therefore,my school should not follow the route of a conserve energy and resource business or else it will affect the academics of the students,and also weak the body since they dont have enough sleep.

In every part of our life, we need someone to share something with them.

Maybe they are our family or friends.

In these days, people are more self-reliance. They think, we don't need anyone to guidance us.

But I think in every moment of life, we need someone, who had a lot of experts to guidance us.

Father and mother are the best persons, to share our everything in our life.

They have a lot of experience and important matters in life. They can feel us In every situation.

We always should ask from our mother or father, about our life decisions.

we should have someone to hear us and support us.

Our parent experience can be a lesson for us.

Experiences make our life. We should learn something from the experiences.

Life is full of thing, actually new thing. Everyday we meet a new thing in our life. That we don't know what is it? and where is it come from? Our parent are older than us, they know everything. They were in our age and now they're older than us. thats means, they understand better about us and about our situation.

My mom she always feel me. If i am sad even if i didn't tell her she know that I am sad. Because she's older than me. She was in my age before me.

We are like a person that don't know about anything, because everything is new for us. Because we don't have any experiences of the thing.

My uncle, he was 17 years old. He wanted to open a small fast food in our country. He always just listen to himself.

He didn't share anything with anyone until he did the work, than he comes and tell us that what I did.

Everyone was sad about him because he was younger and he don't know about anything.

His mother and father told him to finish school first then open a fast food, but he didn't listened to them.

He leaved the school and started his work. In the first he was so happy, but after a few months he become sad.

When he saw his all friends going to school and he works he felt sad.

He was so regretful, because of what he did. He didn't listen to his parent and he just did what he wants.

Than he came to his parent and said sorry, because of not sharing his idea with his parents.

My grandfather said to him"" I was in your age, I did the same mistake that you did, but in different way. I told you to school is the first important thing in our life, you can't leave an important thing in life"".""I had the experience that why i was trying to tell you that. ""My son always share whatever you have in your mind with the person that you can trust and believe, and listen to them, they will always guide you"".

Finally he understood, what he did was wrong, but he also like to work too.

That time he came to his father and share that he wants to study and work.

His father was so happy that his son come and asked him for showing the good way.

His father guide him and show him that what should he do.

He went to school and also continued his work too.

Right now he's a businessman, he always says"" to us to share anything with your family or friends"".

He said that to us"" the way that I am success and a good businessman was my dad experience, my dad guidance"".

I learn from my uncle that if your mom and dad teach you how to speak and how to eat and.... they also can teach us how to life good.

I always ask from my mom and share my day happens with her.

She hear me and feel me. Sometime before i say anything she know, I'm thinking about what and what I want to tell her. Having the experience are good, you know better how to solve a problem and guide someone who trust you.

For and foremost, I disagree with the principal saying that all kids should at least join one extracurricum activity because the student have homework to do and I know that i get a lot of homework maybe you do too i also know teachers give kids projects and if the principal makes them do a extra activity then they wont be able to have anytime to do their own things.

Secondly, I disagree with the principal because the students will get way more tired faster and did you know that someone in Washington DC, fainted due to the principal making the student do a other activity and thats why the principals shouldn't make students join a other activity because it'll most likely make them get tired faster and what we want is to keep our kids healthy but we can't keep them healthy if the principal makes them join a activity.

Lastly,my last reason is stress, stress can come from a lot of things like work,school,friends,parents,children as you see stress comes from a lot and school stress is a big oe because we all know sometimes our grades go down and when we try to bring them up it gets really stressful and espcially if your pricipal is making you do a other activity that'll make even more stress and multiple studies have shown that a lot of the stress that kids get is from school and other activies.

For all this reasons, I would like to go to the Art and Performance Center, seeing all the components and experiences that brings you the fantastic world of the theater.

7B0430EDACBA,"I agree that having a positive attitude is the key to being successful in life. I believe is important to have a positive attitude because having a positive attitude can open doors to different phase in life. For example, when it comes to school, significant others and obstacles that life may throw at us. Is important to not loose our cool and have the type of attitude that everything is going to turn out great at the end of the day.

Having a positive attitude when it come to school can be a way to cope with all your assignments, teachers and schoolmates. Especially being a teenager people thing is not difficult to wake up every morning 6 or 7 AM and deal with people's attitude and also having to worry about the amount of work the teachers give out to students and then going home to do chorus is something that teenager are capable of doing, but adults don't take that time to think that they was teens back in the 60s where life isn't easy but when it comes to school rules have change. Now we must pass SOLs to graduate but, a person who stays positive believes in there self makes it easy for their self to get through what's stop you from being happy.

Everyone in life have to deal with different types of obstacles physically and mentally. For example when i came to America I thought my life was over learning a whole different language and also trying to adapt to whole new country a whole different environment would be hard for me. Instead of being hard head i stayed positive learn English really fast and started to start feeling more comfortable in America. I also was thinking of families back home and how i cant let them down, because they would love an opportunity like this to have a free education and being able to make it to the 12 grade. We all go through so much and the only way to get through is having a positive attitude that things well turn out better than yesterday.

Others would say that you dont have to have a positive attitude in life to be successful because they probably dont have self confidence, someone around to give them hope or have giving up on their self to many times. I believe that having a positive attitude is the key to being successful in life because you viewing life on a whole other level all you see is good things coming your way and the nothing can get in between of your dreams and if you was to fall you going to pick yourself right back up and start again.

In conclusion being able to wake up every morning and thank God for another day and pray that things are going to turn out better than yesterday is an important skill to have in this world we call life. We all have them phase that we go through and we feel like we cant keep moving forward but why stand in the same place with that same negative attitude is going to prevent you from wanting or doing more.

7B0C76128726,"I agree with Prime Winston Churchill; in he saying there is a lot of true and motivation. Failure is the most important element in the pursuit of success. Being successful is not a easy thing for anyone; there is a journey that you have to get through with many obstacles that you may fail at the first time. Also, no matter how many times you fail, you shouldn't give up on you want to do. When you continue to fail, your learn a lot from this mistakes or problems. The better thing are never easy to secure; we always make mistakes, but never too late to start again. As Winston once said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm'' This statement is most certainly true if we are welling go put in the effort to past though feature and attain real success.

If you really want something you going struggle for that and effort the most you can. Everyone who is successful has been through things that has caused them to fail in something the admired dearly, but remember you should never lose hope; mistakes allow you to view your challenge from a different perspective. Failure is only an opportunity to begin again, only this time with a better plan and more understanding. Failure is an unavoidable obstacle, so you must be ready to affront and learn about it. Look examples about people who don't lose hope and keep trying until they did it, and see that these people are representation of success. See the mountain they've claimed and look to it for inspiration and all they sacrifice.

In conclusion, we come to learn more from our failures and difficulties than from our successes. Failure can bring us to better ourselves and begin our plans once more, this time more wisely. If everyone was to successes in their first try, we would not feel accomplished in the presence of success. The most important message to take from these quote is that after you have acknowledge both why failed and how it made you feel, you must attack the obstacle again with enthusiasm. Success it is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all love of what you are doing or learning to do.",3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5
7B802407D629,"We choose our own character traits. One character trait is kindness, someone who is very kind and friendly to everyone. my second character trait is rudeness, this is someone is usually not nice to others. My third and final character trait is helpfulness, someone who is always looking to help others. I chose all of these character traits, as i felt these are all traits that people choose themselves.

The act of kindness is someone who is very kind and friendly, its one of many character traits. A lot of people choose to have this as their character traits, and most have it for a good reason. It should be said that people are not born kind, they choose their own traits that fits them best. Some choose to be kind after seeing how some people can act so different towards other people, or their parents just simply raised them to be kind. This character trait is a very common character trait, and i hope more people is it in the future.

Rudeness is a somewhat uncommon character trait used by a small number of people. Not everyone is going to be a good person, some are rude all of the time for no apparent reason. A lot of people are rude because they are most likely going through something, or thats just the trait they had growing up. I know a lot of rude people, teachers and students, most are rude just because thats the trait they decided to choose. My final thoughts on rudeness is that not everyone is rude, but theres always gonna be that small amount of rude people in the world.

The helpfulness trait is of my most favorite traits. Helpfulness is when someone who is always looking to help someone in need, and also make sure they get the help they deserve. I am a helpful person myself, i try to help people with their problems if i can. A person who is helpful is like that as they have always been like that, and just want to help anyone in need. The world is a much better place with helpful people, i hope they don't go anywhere.

My counter claim is that our character is actually formed by influences beyond our control, and that we learn from these influences what our trait really is. I say this is false, we are supposed to choose our character traits, and they are what makes us who we are.

We choose our own character traits. One example of a character trait is the act of kindness, a person who is friendly to all the people that comes their way. A second example of a character trait is rudeness, these types of people are generally rude to everyone that comes their way. A third example of a character trait is helpfulness, a person who wants to help others in any way.

7C14A6539215,"To keep the resources of the world, Can be necessarily to implement the idea "" four-day school week"". "" The four day school week"" consist of ten hours per day. Adopting this idea it is going to conserve energy and resources. If they spend the whole evening in the school they can learn more and be more prepare for school.

It's a good idea to implement this but at the same time it has some disadvantages . One of them can be that the students will be stressful. A lot of hours in just one place can make the students to got bored an tired of it. It's not just that a lot of students have responsibilities as paying rent and bills. They need to work to pay their responsibilities and if they come to school for ten hours they won't have enough time to make more hours in their job.

If the students assist to school for more hours they got the chance to learn more and improve their skills. In those 10 hours they can even get an extra class , a class that they want. They can have a lot of time to understand more their classes and be more prepare for them. Having that time will be easy to communicate with more people and teachers . The don't have to rush in class anymore , now they got the time to prepare more in class.

To implement this can be a bad idea because if the students come to school for ten hours they will end it up with stress. Be in a place for a lot of our can be really stressful If the students are stressful of school they won't do their best because they are tired of it. Not all the students like to go to the school and for them will be even more stressful. If the students have homework will be even more difficult to get a good rest. They won't have enough rest for them.

Some students got responsibilities at home like help their families at home or some of them have to work to pay their bills. A lot of students pay their own rent and they need to leave early from school and work more hours to effort enough . If they leave late from school they will work less hours and at the end they won't have enough money . Leaving late from school and working a lot going to make them tired of that routine. The students need time to rest as well. If they don't get enough rest to do what they want to do at the end they will end it up stressful and not doing their best at school and at work. If that happens they will have a lot of problems because if they don't do their job property the will got fired and without money to pay their bills. In school can happen the same thing as well with bad grades and not paying enough attention.

In conclusion having this idea can be a bad choice . A lot of students have things to do beside school like working or helping their families . Coming for ten hours can make them to stress easily .Student with stress won't do their best and at the end they going to have bad grades.

7CFA22351B27,"school districts should allow students to graduate one year early but only if they took the courses. If the students willing to sacrifice their time, elective course, and really work to get to their goal of graduating a year early then they deserve it.

From the process it takes to graduate a year before it would seem that yes, they are attending school for less time but from the courses in summer or evening theyre putting the same if not little change in time of the average high school student in just that one year. If they can handle the equivelent of junior and senior year in the same year then it shows how hard working and out going they are and could benefit them when they`re choosing a collage because:

it could impress the collages they'd want to attend they already know the stress of a collage class because of the extra courses they could be in a better position with organization, and being on time

It would also be a great benefit for students who'd join the work force instead of collage because:

they also know the stress from the extra courses if their family is going through financial problems it gives them more time to work they'd have a head start on their life

The only real problem of this would be the amount of time and stress the student had but thats only limited for the school year.

in conclusion i believe school districts should give students the chance to graduate early if they are willing to put the time and effort of two years into one and face the obstacles that come with it. itd be very beneficial to the student and/or their family and create a great layout for them fro what ever comes next.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5
7D2D5053D947,"What are the benefits of working with a group vs working alone. Working alone isn't bad because their no one to rely on. Then and working with a group is more beneficial. reasons being said are more people more ideas, getting help from teammates, and will be less mistake because there more than one person to get help. For example playing in a team sport working with teammates is better than trying to do every thing alone, same thing with a big project.

Just like the saying two heads are better than one. defiantly when working on a project. Being alone there going to be mistake because no one will correct you on the paper. Another benefits of working in a group is more ideas coming from different people and taking that you can learn from it. Not only that if a person is stuck on something the group with help out to solve it together, also it will save a lots of time trying to work by yourself.

Being in a team that the PE teacher assign you, will be hard trying to play alone in a group or team. Working by your self is not helping the team or people skills. In the long run getting a job there will be times when needed to work with co workers or bosses, doing group projects or playing for a team will benefit that. Because it helping on people skill. That learning in experience knowing not everybody is the same.

Working alone helps but I feel in a group is more beneficial. There no motivation being alone it attend to be boring. Therefor more mistakes could happen, limit to some ideas and knowledge, and can't get help because every one is working alone. Doing work in a group helps students be wake, reasons for that is there someone to talk to also it will be less work and save good amount of time. Students attend to dose off or stress when it to much work on their hands.

In conclusion I prefer working in a group feel more beneficial then working alone. It will defiantly help in school if a student is doing a project or playing for a team. Also in the long run With jobs, family, neighbors, or starting a protest will help if being in a group.",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,2.5,3.5
7D519DA76B29,"The use of technology has spread all over the world. Everyone uses technology to talk to family/friends, text family/friends, pay bills online, shop online, etc. To me technology has both positive and negative effects. The positive effect is talking to people you can't see everyday or can't see at all, you can use technology to talk to long distance. A negative effect is the lack of getting stuff done, going outside for fresh air, no person to person communication, etc.

Instead of going outside to be with friends, family, etc most people stay home and just be on there phone all day, watching TV, on the computer, any device people have at home they use. Shopping has changed dramatically. Instead of going to the mall to go shopping most people can just stay home and go online to shop. Paying for bills or going to your bank has changed dramatically. You can pay all your bills, funds, credits, online. Everyone used to get out of there house and go to where they need to go to pay there stuff off, but technology as made it easier for people to stay home an do stuff online.

Half the people in the world think technology is not okay and should be gone. Young kids having technology is even worse because, kids dont play outside anymore they stay inside and play video games, talk to there friends online, watch videos, etc. Teen's are the same too. Almost every teen stays home and talk to friends, play video games like x box, PlayStation, etc. In schools teachers use websites to help students learn and understanding the subject.

Technology has changed the world. Technology does allow people to complete many tasks without talking to people. The world would have been so different if there was no technology made at all. Everyone would be outside more with there friends/family, traveling is the best way to get your mind off stuff and to have fun, eating in restaurants with people you love is the best. Ways to plan stuff out like traveling or eating with friends/family is either using a phone or just talking about it in person.

In conclusion, i think the limitation of human contact has a negative effect. Since technology has been made people have been getting lazy and lazy by the day. Theirs so much things we used to go outside for, we can just stay home and go online. Instead of playing with friends outside we stay home and play video games and if we're bored we stay home and just find something in our device to entertain us.

But do we really accomplish more if we are always doing something to help shape our future or can inactivity also serve a purpose as well? In my opinion, much can be accomplish if we are always doing something to perserve our future and make it safe and way better then how our generation is now. We can make it better for all the generations that comes after us by keep on doing something to shape and preserve our society. Thomas Jefferson wrote that ''determine never to be idle'' which means that always be determined to do something to help shape our society into something more and better and to never lack your worth. If people back then would've never done anything like build roads or invent automobiles or anything, we would've never had what we have now.

Inactivity can also serve a pupose to our society and how our future is going to look like. It can make a huge impact on how we live now and how our future is going to look like and how is it going to be like if people would've been inactive. Everything that we built and invented would'nt be here in this generation or the next one. We probably would've been living like how the great depression was back then but a lot worse because there would'nt be any people working or there would'nt be any cars or even houses and buildings because people were inactive this could lead to all of us being poor. We would've been out there living on the streets with no houses all because people were being inactive back then and not build anything that can help shape our future.

We all have a certain unique skill set we can use to help our world and make our society a better place then what it is now. We can keep making things and accomplish our goals that can be done by not quiting and always keep doing something to make a change because who knows what we can accomplish and how we can make an impact on how our next generation is going to be like if we always keep doing something. A lot of things can be done when we do something instead of being inactive and doing nothing to help with our society because when we do nothing it has a much bigger effect then actually doing something, we could all be out on the streets probably with no job or even a house to live in because it was never invented because of the many people that were inactive in the past. We already accomplished so much because of the people in the past did something and they always kept doing something to actually make a huge difference to what the future will look like. Therefore we accomplish a lot more when we keep doing what we do now a lot can be done, if we keep making an impact our future is going to keep chaging into something more better then how we live now, having always something to do serves a huge purpose.",3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,2.5

Your School should have long hours because student will have four-day week out of school ;Therefor, students will get to relax and fished there work and it is a great way to stay away from stress.

The benefits This will have on your school is ; students will have more time to work in class and understand what the teacher is teaching . Also you will have more time to fish your homework over the four - week day . Long school hours are good for the students because they will remember more of the stuff they teach.

Also students are worried there grads are going to get messed up. Also whenever the teachers is teaching there going miss out on it .When there are sol student meant fail it .

school should add more hours.

Student are in class and hours are passing by and some student are slow at learning but the teachers are rushing them to give what they have and the teachers dropped there grades down because they didn't fished in the time that was given, therefor, schools should give classes more time needed to fish there work.

Students that are tired dont have enough sleep because of all the homework and the jobs some students have to do in only two week ends and its not enough hours for the students to sleep, therefor,

Anyone in the world can be a smart and better person by working on a job to study about objects, study about computers like the use of technology and the learning of cybersecurity, and to visualize and gain your experiences on working in any job you want work on by putting effort and using your brain.

For example, you can imagine of becoming a scientist to learn about sceince, like chemicals, plants, experiments, and understanding more information about science and other objects by experiencing things. Like the more you imagine about things you experience through your job, the less knowledge you have to learn about something that haven't exist in the ability of inventing something creative that is very useful and better than anything.

All you have to do is believe in yourself and use your imagination like to decide whether invent something particular than the other like building a house, a long bridge, and create like a watch to study about anything and learn more about it, you can invent, create, study anythingby using your imagination by experiencing more about things you want to do when you grow up by using your brain, and knowledge to put more effort into jobs.

7E669FF93EB9,"While, some students are distracted others are taking an advantage of it. Although some say that cell phones should not be allowed in classrooms. Actually it should be allowed in classrooms,for research purpose and projects during class. by the used of cell phones. We can learn more about any topic, an example of this can be,if the teacher is explaining something and i don't understand instead of asking him. I can go to internet and find out. all the things that i need to learn and with examples. I agree with the assertion of using cell phones in classrooms.

Those who believe, that cell phones should not be allowed in classrooms,have their reasons,for example they believe that cell phones are distracted, in a way that students can't control it. They also think that cell phones are addictive. However,that is not true because we all can control our self, and i think that if we use our cell phones in a corresponding way, we will not only learn more, we will improve our skills and in the future become professional in anything.

I believe that we should used cell phones for research purpose,for example i remember when i was in English class i got sick, and i had to go to the doctor when i came back, to school the teacher was giving directions for our next assignment,but in that moment i felt like i was out a lot of days,but no it was only 2 days out of class,so i said to him I feel like i had miss a lot of thing just let me know what i need to do, and i will try to do everything that i need,so he said we went over more vocabulary, but right now i am explaining something, if you want to do it you have to stay after school i will be happy to help you. I said no you don't have to explaining me nothing, just give me the vocabulary i will look it up in internet,and i will write down the meaning of each word i will be quiet,so you can keep doing what you doing. He said fine. If cell phones are not allowed in classrooms, I could not do my vocabulary, and not only that i improved my skills by researching for good information which is not easy. I think that this is a good example why we should used cell phones in classrooms, so we can use them in a correct way thinking about our grades.

I also think that we should used cell phones for projects. This is my friend called Generic_Name he is 17 years old we are friends from middle school. In this time we were in government class, once again the teacher gave us a group activity in this case we had to came up with a new country, otherwise invent country,so we had to give it name,where it will be located, and the rulers for its country. After that,all the students got their own computers,but there were not enough for everyone,so we had no computers next,we asked the teacher can we used our cell phones,for the project she asked if there were no more computers and we said no not more,so with no choice the teacher said yes,used your cell phones,but only for the project,without wasting time we got our phones out,and we started working on our new project we worked in our cell phones as we had computers after the hard work we stopped,because the bell ring. This is another proof why cell phones are important they are really helpful in many different s ways we used all cell phones,for the whole project and thanks to that we turned in our project on time.

7F0B7DDE89B2,"I think it is a good idea that some schools have

Four-day work week. because, the schools can save energy and resources like.

food electricity water paper

Does this will help the schools?

First, this can help the schools not to spend Food, Water, Paper, and Electricity. Next, If we have five days of school we are wasting a lot of Food, Electricity, and money. Then, if we have four days of school, we save a lot of money. Finally, with four-day work week it better because, the fifth day of school nobody is in the schools to waste energy and food

. In conclusion, This can saves schools a lot of money.

Why is this a good idea?

First, This can be a good idea because, The Students can sleep more. they will have four days of school. This mean the students will have three days to sleep well. Then, if they add 2 hours more there will be some consequences. If the Students don't sleep well, they will be sleeping in class. After that, they will not do their homework, test, and quizzes. Finally, The Students have to sleep at least 8 hours each night every day. In conclusion it is good to have four day work week.",2.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0
80C0814AF16D,"Dear, Dr. Generic_Name

Thank you for reading my letter. I hope it finds you well. I am currently a junior at Generic_School. I believe that the students should commit to career at a young age because. career can show how creative students can be, and have a had start to choose their careers before they get out of high school.

First, I would like to talk about how creative students can be in their career. When school. For example, I would like to express myself through my art to show my emotions and I love to excess myself through my art. It makes me feel happy but if I don't start choosing my career at a young age then how am I going to know what I want for my career and the students won't know what they want for their career when they get out of high school and that's how I would like to express myself through my career.

Also, about students having a head start to choose their career at a young age. for example, I would not know what to choose if I didn't start in high school it would be a waste of time for me to find a career if I didn't start at a young age, if I started at school then there won't be a problem for me to find one also I would rather start now then later on in my life and how Am I going to express myself if I don't have a career to start with thats why students should think a head of choose their career.

Last, students should think about what they want to do or be when they grow up because schools can help with your career when you need it, they can put you in a class where you want to learn about the career that you choose and it will make is so much easier for the student to start now. for example, if I where to choose a career I would have to tell my teachers what classes that I what to take for my career chooses it can help a lot of students with their career chooses it would be a problem for them to tell the teachers what careers they want and it would be more easier for them to start telling the teachers what career they want and put students in the class they want to take for their career but they have to trust their teachers first then they can tell the students what careers that they what to take or what good classes are good for this career that the student chooses and that's my opinion on students should be commit to a career at a young age.

Thank you for taking the time to read through my thoughts about career chooses that means so much to me and thank you again.

80C2ED8BE6A6,"Online school can be more beneficial to a lot of student's struggling with grades and being late to school because of over sleeping or missing the bus. Going to school takes up a lot of time off stuff you're interested in doing outside of school like playing sports and spending more time at home.

I agree with online classes over going to school because some students feel more comfortable learning in their house rather then going to school. Some students also have trouble with over sleeping due to a lack of sleep causing them to miss the bus and be late to class. Online school starts in a more reasonable time of day so it's more convenient for those that over sleep to attend class on time. This allows students to have more energy which will help them focus on their work and be more productive in class. When student's get sick they miss days off school which causes them to be behind on class work, for some students being be hide on class work causes stress because their grades go down. But you can still attend online class if you're sick. You can also attend online classes while on vacation with a laptop you'll rarely have missing work to do which is a big positive for improving your grades.

However, some may argue that looking at the bright screen for a extended amount of time will put a strain on your eye's. Also that it's easier to cheat on test's and quiz's in online classes then it is to cheat in school, because the teacher dosen't know what your doing on.

That is my reasoning on why taking online classes is more beneficial then going to school.  ",3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5

Therefore, some students like to finish high school early for to have time to work one year early. When students work hard and saving money for college, they will study without any worried about the money that should pay to college.

80DD7EE85BF7,"I disagree for adding one and a half of hour in school days. Because reason #1 is that we are in school for 8 hours doing work and other thing and we get tired and it's just to much forus kid's or grown ups.

Reason #2 is you don't have a lot of time to do your childhood things cause your in school for 9 hours and 35 mins.

For example you just cameout of school your tired you what have fun but then you got to do homework and that can take hours to finish your done but you can't go outside cause it's to dark and your parents won't let you cause of hours of school. That's reason #2.

Reason #3 is homework you always get home almost every single day doing some extra work and is can take hours to finish. For example you come out of school at 4:00 your tired but you got homework and then you finish your home for like 2 or 3 hoursof extra work but you can't do anything really fun like go out somewhere with freinds cause it's to late and dark. That's reason #3.

Reason #4 is a appointment you always come out school at 2:45 and your appointment is at 3:00 but you can't go cause you got extra hours in school i know you can leave early but waste you child or grown up learning time in school. That's reason #4.

I get it if yall school's set extra time in school just to make us smart,or have a good life,and a good job,but us kid's and adult's need time for are own self so this is all my reason and example's that I disagree for having extra time in school. ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5
81B7A7CB8829,"A man named Albert Schweitzer once said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing"". In this case setting an example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others. For example, younger people look up to those who have struggled like they have and whom came from broke down homes and had succeeded through out their way. People are also influenced by those who have been into sports and who started in the struggle just like they've had, who later became the best. Showing good actions lead people to persuing you and your examples, which later leads them to the right path.

When Albert speaks of an example influencing others many ideas come to mind, one of which was how people who grew up in broke homes and succeeded with their life have had a huge affect on the youth. These people who are known for their success have gone through struggle and hard bottom rock moments. Although through out their journey people may have put them down, they still try their best in being a good example for others and the generation after them. People like this have gone to school and have worked hard in getting good grades to persue what they wanted to major in. They have gone through many obsticules to do what they love and see potential in. Leaders like these have worked their best to do what they want, which leads to having an amazing job with a great career.

Although many people look up to those who came from rock bottom, they also look up to those who are well known for their athleticism. As we may know football, basketball, wrestlers, soccer, ect. are sports that are well heard of through out different countries. These sports have not just helped people out with their physical apperiances but have also helped them out mentaly. For example, for those who have started from not knowing the sport and who were told that they weren't good enough didn't just give up because they were told so, instead it pushed them into getting better. For those who have tried the sport know that when you join a team you later find love for the sport and want to get better. Well known players have trained and worked hard everyday to be where they are today. They've taken risk and tried their best in their games or matches, they've given their all to be noticed by college coaches, or even scouts.

However, both doing great in school and being a great athlete have been known for being a example in influencing others. These two however different but very similar examples both persuade others in; working hard and trying their best. They influence people that you have to never give up in what you believe in or in what you hope to persue in life. They make you mentaly stronger and challange you in becoming the person who you soon hope to be. In conclusion, setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence other people.",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0

82722CEBCAB3,"When the entire class need to make a project in groups, but your group work more than the rest of the class do you think it's fair if the teacher give a praising to the entire class? When I think about praising student work, I think in: hard work, effort, patience, and a consistent student. I agree with the self-esteem come from praise. Also praising students help to built self-steam, but you only can praising when the student make your best effort.

For example; one student go to the bed at three in the morning and sleep only three hours making his project and checking all the project make sure is complete, but other student go to the bed at nine and sleep all night and don't worry about his project. Some students are more lazy than the others. The best decision the teacher can make is recognize the student who really make the best work and effort.

However, some people believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. The teacher recognize student's work maybe work more hard in the next project or homework. If the teacher built a self-esteem praising students must be self-confident in order to learn. They believe teachers need recognize all student's work not only some students.

In conclusion the teachers only need recognize student's work when the students really make a good work, best effort and this way the teachers can help to built self-esteem and motivate the student work hard in all the classes, projects, and homework. Student's with a high self-esteem are the students who make a lot things is this world. Many times the students with high self-esteem are the students who go to the university, because they know are good in something; this is the reason because we have today doctors, lawyers, teachers, other professional people.",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0
840357B74A16,"Should students have partnerships with companies that interest the type of employment they want? Students think it's a great idea to go to different businesses because it will be helpful to them in the future. If a student is stuck on what he wants to do in life the businesses can help them see what they want for their future. Students should have partnerships because students can get more skills about that job, students learn more about the job their going for, and student can see if that the job they really want to be in.

First, students can get more skills about there job because they are in the business hands they can go around learning on how they do everything. They also get to see how the company is ran and how they handle business. Student can learn a lot we it comes to the business if the company shows them about it. If the company helps the students then the students are going to want to take classes about it. Their going to want to go to the Tech center about it their going to want to learn more.

Second, is that they learn more about the business by going to the company. They learn how to control the mechanical stuff over at the company. They will learn about the paper work over there. They will even know where they want to work at over there if they learn more about it. They will have a fun experience about their job they most likely want to do when they get older. They would be even more interested to take classes at school about business and will pursue in that type of employment .

Third, students can really see if they want to be in that type of business. Similar to the other two this helps them, but not only if they want to pursue in that job it's for if they really don't want the job. Also they can find a back up plan if that business is not the right one for them. They can go see if its a bad business, if it helps with the future, and if it's the job they want to go after. They can't focus them to like if they didn't see it for themselves they won't do it if it's not for them, they're going to find something that they want to do not what they need to do. Students can see of they want to work there they can see the positive and the negative of the business they can't be focused, or they can't just cant be focused on that one thing.

In conclusion, The students get to choose if they want to or not. They should know what they want to or figure out what they would do in the future. Students can't be focused to do mainly anything they have to find what they like for they can do it. Other people may say that they will go there and not learn anything,however if students go there for what they are a looking for they can pursue it. If students font get to choose then students wouldn't get more skill about the job, wouldn't learn as much about the job, and wouldnt't even want to see the type of job. Students can see they future if they get the help they need by companies letting them learn about it will help students pursue their occupation.",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0

85C54BD4D416,"Thomas Jefferson, writer of the Declaration of Independence and founding father of the United States, once said, ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" In Jefferson's eyes, a world spent in constant work and motion represents a more productive and accomplished world. However, there is merit in a world that does not work without break and resolves to be idle at times. A world that is always working may also be a world that is burning out, diminishing the value of building connections and reflecting. A world that is idle when it recognizes its need to be has more value than a world that is always working, as it allows time for cognitive development and reflection, mental health, and inspiration.

In the body, the brain represents an entity that is constantly developing, creating new ideas, and planning for the future. If a human was always working, there would be no time to create new ideas or plan. The potential of the human brain would reduce, as the human brain would never have the time to step back and reflect on its past experiences and how it wants to reflect lessons learned from those experiences in the future. For example, if Thomas Jefferson had not taken time off to create new ideas and plan for his country before writing the Declaration of Independence, the United States would be very different from the way it is today. Every idea would be thought of on the spot, and the potential ramifications and consequences of each idea would not be carefully taken into consideration. In addition, the human brain requires breaks to keep working, just as the human body needs sleep to continue on the next day in a healthy state. Time spent idle does not equal time spent wasted; time spent idle is time spent reflecting, planning, and developing. Time spent being idle carries the potential to be a valuable learning experience to the human life, as well. In colleges, the requirements for acceptance do not only include academic excellence - they also include extracurriculars and attention to when the brain needs a break. If students did not take time off to develop, their potential for achievement in life would reduce. Therefore, a world spent constantly working does not always represent a world of accomplishment.

Some argue that if one is not always working, then one cannot accomplish as much as one can, as a minute spent idle could lead to a day spent idle, and so on. Contrastingly, if one is always working, then one has a much greater risk of crashing. Mental health is an essential reason as to why the world today does not and cannot constantly work as Jefferson wants it to. Many studies show that top students in classes, those who never stop working towards their goals, can have a greater risk of developing depression, anxiety, or addiction to drugs. This is because their brains cannot comprehend the constant work, and moves to other unhealthy tactics of releasing emotions. Several stories in the world detail the downfall of the most intelligent people, simply because the never took a break for themselves. Furthermore, if one's life is spent constantly working, one's brain is exposed to extreme competition and high standards. These two concepts are unhealthy for the human brain, as one may believe that they actually are not working hard enough and need to work themselves even harder, when reality shows that they already work themselves unhealthily. This concept ties in with the concept of unhealthy comparison, which further proves why mental health is one of the largest reasons as to why the world cannot constantly work. Those who always work also always compare themselves to others who are working, and often times do not take into account that what they are doing is very unhealthy. All of these concepts combined greatly heighten the chance in the deterioration of mental health. A world spent working constantly is a world exposed to bad mental health.

Finally, if the world is spent constantly working, then there is no time for inspiration of any sort. If one's brain is constantly in a working state, it will never spend time appreciating the beauty of the world around it and taking in inspiration for future plans. A prime example of this concept is the work of artists. If an artist such as Vincent Van Gogh or Claude Monet was constantly working, said artist would never spend time collecting inspiration, and the work of said artist would be mediocre instead of beautiful and inspiring. Inspiration flows from person to person, and if everyone was working constantly, no one would serve as a source of inspiration for others around them. Also, brainstorming represents one of the most important parts of formulating any plan for any person in any situation, and constant work does not allow time for that brainstorming and inspiration to occur. In schools, teachers emphasize the necessity of brainstorming before writing, and this concept is emphasized so much because inspiration is what leads to the development of mankind. Role models also result from the need for the world to take a break, as it allows for humans to gather inspiration from others and plan how they want to lead their lives. Thus, if the world was constantly working, there would be no inspiration. Without inspiration, the world would not be where it is today.

Cognitive development and reflection, mental health, and inspiration represent three of the most essential reasons as to why the philosophy of Thomas Jefferson cannot apply to how the world works today. Constant work leads to stunted development, deteriorated mental health, and no sources for inspiration. Without time spent being idle, the inventions, buildings, ideas, movies, and other parts of the world today would have never come to fruition. A person always working does not represent a person living life to the fullest. The United States and our world today would not be the same without time spent idle,",4.5,5.0,5.0,4.5,5.0,5.0
86E335C1EB06,"Is it a good idea for a young students to commit to a career in high school? It's a great idea so students can work on there career, and not need to focus on what they don't need in high school, to work towards their career. Reasons I agree are, they may want to follow their parents choice in career, can use school courses to excel in career choice, and why it's a good idea to start a young age.

They can follow their parents choice in career. That can be a easy choice for many people, because the student can ask for advice from their parents. They can ask their parents what courses' they took as a young student as they once were. The reader may be asking ""what if their parents' didn't go to high school?"" that can be true and what if the career the parents' have isn't for the student to follow. Then they don't have to follow their parent career, and they can choice their own career, or any close family members, or anyone they look up to, and would like to be as close as possible as them when their older. You can always just follow your own career and can start a generation for your family to follow your example.

If the parent choice didn't work they can choose what classes they can take to help them reach the career the student wants. Schools are all different so not all of them will have the same courses. Example if you want to be a chef and some sort of cook, you can take a cooking courses for the year. The teacher can show you how to prepare a dish and how to present. There are so many choices in career's you can pick from. If you want to be a engineer you have to take your four main classes Math,Science,History,English. These classes will help you in the long run through high school years. The more experience you get from this courses will give you in vantage to the other student that choice your career later in their high school years.

Finally the last reason, why it's a good idea to start early. It's pretty simple that you don't have to worry about what your career is going to be. It can be a lot easier if you know what you want to be, you can already plan the courses you would like to take. When people ask you ""what are you going to do when your done with school?"" you would say ""it's none of your business will see in the years to come!"". You shouldn't say that it's just rude to say. When someone does say that you would have a answer and you should say it proudly. You would just focus on what you need to do. Don't let anyone distract you on what you want to do.

Conclusion on why it's a good ideal for students' to have a career choice in their younger age. Following parents or close family member to the career they choice. If their career choice isn't for you, make a career you can follow and want to follow. Taking courses in school that can help you excel in career that you picked for yourself. When asked that question on what your going to be, you'll be ready answer it.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5
8778DE7C8D0E,"introduction

The people who value selft-reliance should seek guidance from experts and authorities,

instead of taking their own decision about life's important matters. When we say experts we are talking about people that know alot more about the topic then us. We can compare this an a teacher and student.

The teachers they have graduated from what they know lets say science class. They have to do alot to become a teacher in that career. This is why I say that if we value self-reliance we need help from experts. that way we can subcess in life. However there is some decision that we can take by ourself. For example, we can choose if we want to drink alcohol, and smoke. for that type of decision we just have to think about who we are hurting too, and as we know it is ourself and nobody else. if we don't take about ourself and the decision thaty we make nobody will.

Reason 1

In my opinion self-reliance is really important in every single person life. When we talk about Self-reliance is about decision. There is times that we think we are right in every decision that we make. However, we have to know that no one is perfect as a human. So, there is times where we make bad choices. One good example could be when we are tenergers. at that age is when we need more help than anything because there is alot of things that can influenciate us really easy. At that time is when we need help from experts and what better experts then our parents. They want the best for us, so they will teach us what could be the best and what have to really matter is this life because they love us. I'm not talking and general because there are some parents that don't really care about what his son or her dauther are doing, but some of them do. Also, we can look for another type of experts who can be profesional and have a diploma in what they are experts in. So, it can be really helpful for us to subceed because they have been studying for years their career. Also, it can help us to make better decison trought life and make us a better person.

Reason 2

Bad decison can hurt ourself. decison is something that we all have to make one day. it could be good or bad decision or sometimes there are some decision that look good, but it could take us to do something bad. However ther are decison that cna hurt ourself and can take us to do something stupid in life. For example, a person want to nibest money to create a restaurant. At first it sound good because what we all think is that we only win in this type of business, but the reallity is that it could be like a challange for the person. some people don't take sometime to think about the consecuences of creating a restaurant. They don't think about the things that they have to pay out from the money that they are making of the restaurant. They don't think about that they can lose all their money if the restaurant doesn't work. When it happens that people lose all their money they can get depress, and some of them have even take their life. So, here is when we need the help from experts and not take the decison of creating the restaurant by ourself. Those people that we call experts know alot more then us because they have graduated from it. They know everyhting about business and what could be best for us. So, we can subcess in business life and don't lose money.

counterclima.

Someone would argue that making decison by ourself is better because that way we won't have to blame on anybody if we make bad decision. Also, we can learn how to be responsable in the decison that we make. Howevere, we don't need to wait untill that happen better look for experts, so they can help us to make good decision and not bad decision two heads are better ten one.

conclusion

In conclution the help from experts is the best way to do the things. They can teach us how to be better and thats why they have been created in this world to look for them and ask for help. sometimes we need to acept that we can do it by ourself and thet we need help from experts or our patrents. We have to look for different sources to subcess in life. In some points we have to be strong but to take any decision we need to be social, what I mean by it is to ask for help and make good decision.",3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0

Another thing that the older kid can learn is to talk to people without being scared or shy this can also help them by getting a job when they grow up. Talking to the young kids can help them learn about the kid and how they act in class and around other people.

It can also help younger students in many ways. One thing it can help them with is learning new thing from the older kids somethings they can learn from them is like how to do math,homework, and how to act in the middle of class without being rude to the teacher. It can also help them learn how to respect others like there parents,teacher,and the older kids. It can also teach them how to talk to other people without being scared or shy to talk with someone or i front of the class.

Programs like this can help both young kids by making new friends with the older kids or talking to other kid and making friends that way. They can also learn a lot about other people like were are they from how old they are. This can also help the older kid see how the younger kids act and see with they need any help during class with work like reading ,writing or math.

Many programs for kids can help them in many ways by teaching them many new things that can help them later on in life or when they need help they know how to do something because they had learned in from some one older i their past and maybe later on he can help other people by teaching them how to do stuff they didnt know how to do.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0
880188B5EED8,"People say first impressions are almost impossible to change. I think you can change someone by getting to know each other, spending more time together, or ask them how they feel.

If you start talking to someone for the first time and you think their personality is really bad try to know the person more. In my experience, when I see someone for the first time like at work or school right away I think they're mean from their face expressions and attitude. Sometimes they think the same way too, so they are mean back.

You should spend time together and go to places where both of you guys like to go. Their attitude might of changed because maybe they needed someone to talk to and go out more. There's people that their personality are just different and you have to accept it.

Lastly, People go through a lot in life and their personality starts to change. Also, you have to ask them how they feel because sometimes they feel depressed or angry about something and need someone to talk to. It's better to be there for them or help each other out.

In conclusion, people say ""Don't judge a book by it's cover"" because you never know why they behave like that. If you don't know them, still ask if they're okay. It is possible to change their personality and make them a better person.        ",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.5

The older students knows a lot of things more than younger students because the older student knows how to read, knows how to do math, and knows science and social study. But, sometimes older student might forget about things that they were taught in elementary school.

Also, there's some new ways that the elementary student are taught in a different ways because it would make it easier for the younger student to understand it more, or the younger student is taught something new and they can help the older student understand what this new idea is, and the older student teach new things for them to know and be papered.

When the older student teach the younger students, they want to papered them because when they start a new unit and the younger student heard of what the unit is about, they know and understands them and will get good grades,and the older students wants the younger student to be papered for next year or this year, also the older student wants the younger students to improve their grades and their test grades.

When the school have a program that pairs older student and the younger student, it helps them because they have new ideas and they know a lot of new different subject that the older students don't know about the subject or a equation. Also, they can bond and tell them how it's like being a kid now days, and the older student tells their stories about their childhood and what it was like being a kid in the past. The older and younger student have different experience with their childhood and their elementary, which they can help with each other and the program for the older and younger student will help them improve their skills and their grades.

89857315A1A4,"How to distribute forty work hours a week most usefully? Nowadays, a four-day work week is very rare, because this system is new; people always being careful when something new come out, but then they understand it is better. The four-day schedule is more balanced, energy and money saving and variable. This is why, I believe, our school should should follow the new schedule.

First, the forty-day school week is more well-distributed, because the students would have more time for rest, doing homework; so their ability to study will have been raised. On another hand, ten hours in school might be exhausting for the pupils, but the school administration may make breaks longer and more frequent to solve the problem of tired students

Second, the four-day schedule lowers the use of energy and resources. The school would use less electricity to heat and cool the building; it will spent less money for servicing the students and investigate saved money to science researches, equipment and study program development.

Third, with the sour-day schedule the pupils become more free: they might share more time with their family and friends; spent more time for their hobbies and working. The students may hardly learn if they are late for making project or plan the interesting and fun weekend in the three days; the bad thing about rest four days: you will not rest. School days will be very busy, hard; but maybe more educational and efficient. Long ten hours in school might be uncomfortable for the students, who do extra curriculum activities like preparing courses, art clubs and sports. However, our school has all comfortabilities to do extra curriculum activities inside the school's building, so the students do not need to go anywhere else.

To conclude, the four-day school week seems experimental for people yet; but when something new is thought the people realize an idea is innovative, then the idea becomes an action, which becomes regular.   ",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0

I have completed quite a few goals in my life because it was all i would put my focus to. With certain things it takes one of another to be with you through it to help you, Because it would depend on what you need to have done. I've helped lots of people get through on what they needed and sometimes its more of what has to be done.

People always need to help themselves because it would make them better in their life in my opinion. Its good to see people doing well because of the achievements they have decided to complete. lots of amazing opportunities like you could get a good job, A new car, House or just anything that you would want in general. The small things in life could be just done on its own without you or anyone having to do something about it.

So overall many achievements would be done if you are always working hard for it and could be better if you do more than what you're suppose to do. It's great to help yourself in life because you don't know how good it would turn out in the end. There is people that i know that always worked hard for what they wanted in life and got what they needed.

8A0A3FE01FE7,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Many believe sitting in a classroom is better for students education, but others believe it more reliable for online or video conferencing. Distance learning won't give you the same benefit as sitting in a classroom. Its more reliable to sit in classroom because if not you could fail, system can shut down, and you'll be getting more physical help in a classroom.

Many like distance learning because it's more flexible, but because it's really flexible a lot of people have a higher chance at failing then passing. Imagine, a lot of people don't like waking up at six in the morning to get ready for school, so what would you expect from a student who stays home. He/she could wake up late and still miss there class which means they're missing the material and education they need. Others irresponsible students will forget about the class and they won't care on doing the work. They will have the mindset of ""it's online, i can finish it later"". Many student fail to do there work because of laziness and for being irresponsible. Especially, if the weather is nice outside many students tend to make plans and won't have the same attention towards school like before. In the other hand, if the weather nice outside and students go to school , sit in a classroom, in the afternoon they wll be able to enjoy the weather and get there work done..

Numerous of computer's systems shut down because of many different reason. If this were to happen to a distance learning student, they wouldnt be able to log in. Some systems take hours, day, and maybe even weeks to get fixed. Other computers have trouble accessing internet. Without any internet, no student will be able to do any online class or video conferencing. Another problem with computers are, that the power goes out. If you computer or any cellular device is not charged where would you be able to plug it in? How would you get your classes done? How would you turn the things you need in on time? These are a few question people dont stop and think about. Therefore, because of these troubleshooting problems it best to go in to a classroom.

All students have many different learning skills. Some prefer physical help instead of visual learning. Learning the material physically is way more reliable to learn easier and faster. Physical learning can help people get there work done faster, easier, and not get distracted by other things around them. Students can be more focused on their work and get it done on time. Others say the environment in which there in doesn't matter as long as there focued , but to other people it does matter. While students are at home they can easily get distracted and forget they have work that needs to be done. this will cuase many students to fail and would have to retake the course.

Which attitude should you make to let your day continuing to be a great day? You get angry and ruin everything, or you give a bright smile and make a nice conversation. Your positive attitude definitely gives you an energy to show your enthusiasm in daily activities. A short fact in Generic_School, students enjoy to go to the library before the class starts, because there is a big welcome from those librarians.

To begin with, I like reading books because it helps me when I'm mad or just in general. Comedy books are one of my favorite to read because it cheers me up more than anything beside music. I like imagining things when I read because it makes the story more interesting like people talking in my head. Imagining helps me learn more because I am a slow learner I don't learn fast like other kids do so I like to sit down and imagine all the things the teacher was talking about so I can catch up with the class.

Also, Imagination helps me a lot when it comes to studying because I am not good at remembering things. Studying is not my thing yet because there are big words I don't understand especially when it comes to English and math. English is more of smart people stuff I get so lost in English because we do a lot of work at once and the confuses me. English taught me new things I never knew before like having a introduction in every paragraph.

In addition, Learning is hard when you have a lot of kids in the class playing and not letting the other kids learn. Some people take learning as a joke but I take it seriously because I want my dreams to come true I always wake up in the morning happy to go to school to learn something new. Learning is important it helps people get to where they want to be either it's a dream, a location or read and write things. It is all imagination it helps a lot of people each and everyday by studying, learning or reading books because I enjoy it a lot it helps me fill up my emptiness.

In conclusion, I agree imagination is more important than knowledge because it a it of people just like it helps me. Learning is important because it helps you reach your goals in life, and studying is not my thing but imagination helps me with studying because I can imagine the things we talked about.

I just want to let you know my opinion about not letting student who have less than a C in their grades participate in any of the activities. I think that it is right that you do that rule in our school because if you do, it might help the students understand that it is really important that they have good grades.

This may help the students but not only them it might help the teachers to. I think this because it will help the teacher because they will have more interest in teaching us the students because they will know that we may attention and not that we just play around in class. It will help the students because they will know that if they try hard to bring their grades up they will be able to participate in the activities.

So, I really think this will help us so that we may attention more to our grades. I think that this is important because I personally think that my grades are important to me and to my family.

Asking multiple people can give you more ideas and it could be a lot smarter asking for advice. Therefore you were writing a main idea and your main idea was just the hunted house and if you go and ask people for a good spooky main ideas they can come up with main ideas you have not even thought about. However if you got a group and ask them to come up with ideas every one will many ideas and you can just figure out which idea is the best.

Manner-better choices

It can sometimes be hard if someone is trying to make a better choice. Like if your being bad and your teacher gave you an advice and the advice was to do all your work and to behave and your grade will increase. Your going to have to make a better choice to behave or not behave. And if you cant pick you can just go and ask other people if you should start behaving more in class. One of the guys says one day your going to become a leader one day and he will have to be a good person.

Tone- expiring

Seeking multiple options can help you in a good way because it can give you more ideas,something you never thought about, something thats new that came to mind, making a better choice, more details that come to mind.

Therefor you were doing a group project. The teacher would want you to form a group because when your doing your project. The other students that are working with you on the class project they can come up with new details about the project. And you project will get completed fast that you will have more ideas you wanted to add for the project. Like if your were doing a project about any animal your group would pick the animal they know mostly about. Then you come up with a idea and you think its not a good idea. Then just ask you group and they will tell you if your idea is good and add it on the project.

8C5BF0347F87,"People around the world have thought about the way students should be teach or the way they should be treated but a few have notice that many students are struggling to build self-esteem. Students have difficulties and they affront them without their parents' help. Consequently many end up loosing their self in the worse way and they take paths that guides them into substances that had damage the rest of the society, like drugs or the alcohol. Furthermore, parents lets teachers decide what to do with their child because they think schools will teach them the right way to learn about how life works and that includes self-esteem. Although some people say praising student's deficient work helps build self-esteem because it bring hope for them, actually praising deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards because students will not improve their work and it is unfair for the hard working students.

According a survey found in Google, many students quite school at a young age because they disbelieve how good they are at schooling. Furthermore, the survey display a chart where a big number of those who quite schools are the greatest students and according to the writer they do not have enough knowledge about it. Praising them probably won't help them learn fast and smarter but it does not let them give up easily she wrote in a quote.

However, students that are praise for their deficient work never improve. For example Generic_Name, my friend's brother he quite schools since for years because he says that nothing he learns at school apply in personal life.

Even though his teachers did everything they could to help him improve his grades, additionally they praise his worst work and it did not even work. Moreover, The New York Times post an article about students failure and they conclude that students that have a job and study at the same time, they are more likely to finish high school. In the other hand students that gets money from their parents, most of the time they do not finish high school and if they the do, they do it with the lowest grades ever.

In addition, praising student's deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. According to the Generic_School, two of three students in a class graduate, but those who graduate are the ones that work hard and study for long hours to achieve their goals. Clearly, praising students deficient work shows that schools are becoming worst more than in the past years and students now are not competent to apply for a simple job. For that reason, many parents believe that deficient work lowers learning standards and that schools are getting worse and weaker every year.

In conclusion, self-esteem comes from the student's best effort, by working hard and not being unfair with the others. As we know Steve Job achieve his dreams by hard work and not by the praise of the society or even his parents. Because of his great achievements,

Apple is still one of the greatest companies ever created. Definitely, those kind of examples teach and stress the importance of building self-esteem by hard work. Every people have different thoughts about how a student should be teach but whatever they choose will influence their children's life forever.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0
8CDBA4104C7E,"Identifying a career in high school helps students prepare for their future. In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Committing to a career as a young age it's a good idea.

First of all, identifying a career in high school help students to achieve their goals a little earlier. For example, if they start to study and be familiar with a specific career, they can graduate early. Meaning they might not have to spend 4 years in college, as everyone else. They can probably graduate from college after 1-2 years of studying for their particular career. Since they already going to have the knowledge from the courses of high school.

Another example is, students can start to take their future in a mature and serious way. For example, those courses can help motivate students about wanting to have a better future. Meaning they can change their thoughts about not wanting to study for a career. And that they're the ones responsible for their own things. It can teach them that having a career is that important thing that it's going to take them somwhere in life.

While some people think this is a good idea, some might not. Some people think that this is a waste of time. For example, students are going to have more things to worry about. Like studying more and passing extra classes. And this can cause for students to be mentally and physically tired. So they these people rather wait until college.

However, waiting until college can be a little late because students aren't going to have enough time to think about a partcular career they want. For example, once students are out to college, they need to have the career they're going to study for. And if they don't, they could pick one that they aren't really passionate about. Which causes more years in college, or them dropping out of college. And this can cause not having a great job, or future.

To conlcude, committing to a career as a young age is a good idea. It's a good thing for students to do it because it can help them to prepare for their future. Committing as a young age help them to achieve their goals a little earlier, which is amazing. It can help them to know what to expect when they go to college. Committing as a young age for a career can help students in so many ways, and these are examples in the ways it can help. ",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

It is clear that finishing high school in just three years can be the best opportunity. One can be to get high school out of the way. Not everyone likes high school year, therefore it is the great way to graduate early and accomplish to get into your dream college school. This program that let you take courses during the summer can be a great option to finish high school quickly, the aim of this study is to, so students get out of high school, and have enough time to start processing and think about what want to do in college or start working to help out their parents on necessary things, such as, bills, rent, and etc.

However, not all student would take this action, it emphasized that students may not have time, it can affect their sleep schedule, and not completing school. Some, of course, may think that you're not learning fulfilling, for instance, regular school year is like ten months and if one take the programs, you're only taking extra courses during the whole summer, that's like saying you're missing a whole ten months of school. In addition if I were to take this program, I would really do as much as I can during the summer courses, and courses to get extra credits that i need for the colleges that I;m applying to. and soon I'll start working, and apply for a scholar ship, also applying to universities or colleges that i would like to attend to,

In conclusion, many people may not agree or join the programs, we all have different opinions, different beliefs, this program can help many students to start off thinking majors,work, so therefore, I'd recommend students to take this offer, and see where it can take you. I can assure one can accomplish something for their goal in the future. ",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,2.5

Until one of your friends call you over to play over to play basketball, you decide to go and play basketball and it is on of the most fun you have had in a long time. An enjoyable activity you can do outside is play basketball because it is addictive, it can make you physically fit, and it can make you mentally fit.

First of all, you can get addicted to basketball because it's so enjoyable that once you play it, you don't want to quit. You can get so addicted to it that instead of playing once or twice a week you start playing it seven times a week, you can start playing it way more than you did a month ago. This addiction can make you enjoy basketball way more than you used to.

Next, some people enjoy basketball because if how fit you can become just from playing basketball. People find that so enjoyable becasue you can get fit and have fun from playing basketball. People even play basketball just to exercise and stretch. This leads you to working out while you run across the basketball court and shoot the ball into the hoop.

Finally, it can make you mentally fit because of how focused you are on basketball. Basically what I am saying is instead of being sad and depressed at home, you could be outside focusing on only basketball and having fun. This leads you to get rid of sadness and depression, which is why some people find this activity so enjoying.

Basketball is an activity is very enjoyable because of how addictive it is. How physically fit you can become just from playing basketball. How mentally fit you can become.

8E64BE4119C3,"Schools offer different options of schooling, they have is Online School , Public School , Private School and also Video Conferencing . However taking classes from home wouldn't benefit students the same way Public School would benefit them due to the fact; Some students are visual learners, Students wouldn't have a big social life outside of their home , Students can slack on their own education an have no motivation and also they could be relying on Google answers when they don't understand the material.

Students have different methods to remembering a material they have learned. Everyone isnt the same, Everyone has their own different techniques; Some people may be visual learners, They need someone to be speaking to them explaining step by step and some students just like peace and quite to figure it out on their own. Personally I am a visual learner for every subject, I would need my teachers to give examples and to go over everything to me step by step to learn the material the teacher is teaching. My classmate, Generic_Name has a different opinion, Generic_Name needs a quite place to concentrate and to think about his work rather than a teacher talking the whole class period.

In Elementary , Middle school and High school they plan a lot of activities for the kids. Schools have dances, concerts and even field trips being home schooled you wouldn't be able to enjoy none of the fun activities the school would have planned for your classmates. Being home schooled you wouldn't have that "" high school experience "" everyone claims they love so much and would do anything to go back too. Being home school would also effect your social life for the real world. In school they might not have a class for communication but going to a Public schools does teach you how to speak up and communicate with other people you dont know and that would really be beneficial for the real world after school when you go into your career.

On the weekend I personally hate doing homework, I like to think of my home as a lazy environment for myself rather than another school place. I think if kids were to be home schooled they wouldn't be able to concentrate at home the whole time they are supposed to. There would be no consequences for the student as if when they aren't paying attention or just on their phones the whole time. There would be no teachers or administrators to be motivating the student to get to work, be on time or even get your'e grades up. Being home schooled and doing online school they would start getting on the wrong track after some time. If my house for me was a school environment i would procrastinate my school work so much like saying "" ill do it in 15 minutes "" "" ill do it the next 15 minutes "" and so on to the point i forgot because i have no motivation for my work.

Having no teachers or administrator around it would be easy to cheat. not understanding the material and not being able to ask questions your last resort is to cheat for answer. Students will find the answers then think they have a easy way out of online school by relying on Google answers. Students can also pay someone to be doing their work for them and manipulate other kids to agree and do the work for them. Students attending online school or homeschooling have a lot of ways to cheat for their classwork.

I disagree that home school or online school would be beneficial for students because they wouldn't be able to learn and understand everything and to being able to ask questions, Students wouldn't have a social life outside of their home and not be prepared to communicate with people outside in the real world, Students would't have any motivation for their school work and start slacking off and lastly they can find easy ways to get out of their own work and having it done without them actually doing any work.

When people show small acts of kindness it can help someone's attitude to improve,

it can make someone's day better, help someone become a better person, and can help someone going through some hard times.

Showing small acts of kindness can help someone's attitude to improve by doing things that make them happy. Telling them what's wrong to say to someone so they know to not say it. Show love towards them because the attitude they have might may be really bad, but showing them love can help it improve a lot. Finally, they will slowly improve it might take time. The most important part is having a good attitude towards them even if you think it's not going to help it is because you're showing them how to give a good attitude back to anyone.

Helping someone's day better is by giving them a compliment it can effect them in the most positive way you can think off.

924748264D34,"High school year is the most important year in students life. Some school programs allow students to graduate in three years,if you can choose, which one would you like to take? traditional or three years? For me, I would think of four years high school. Because traditional four years high school is more better than three years high school. For example, if you take three years high school, then you can not take elective courses except you take the courses during the summer time. Also, I think three years high school don't have much time to let you get ready for college. In addition, I think four years high school is more comfortable then three years high school.

First of all,if you take the three years high school, then you can't take elective courses except if you take the courses during the summer time. I think have elective courses was important, because that mean you can take courses that you interesting of. For example, I was taking the traditional four years high school right now. A year before, I remember I have two elective class, and one of them was Korean. Even know learning different language is hard, but it was very interesting, because you are learning about another countries' culture and how did they treat people in their ways. That's why I think elective classes was important.

secondly, take the courses during the summer time? Of course not. In the summer everyone was plan go to the beach or traveling to another country with the family. Think about that sunshine, sky, golden sand, and beautiful seas. There are people swimming and surfing, people wear the sunglasses sat down there and have coconut on their hand. But at this time, you have to take courses at home or summer school. Sitting at chair, face all these hard problem and finished it. In addition, summer is the time that people relax and have fun of. So I would not taking the courses during the summer time.

In addition, lots of students are feeling nervous and scared in the last year of their high school time. Because they are wondering what college they going to and can they do well when they get in the college. Even know I was senior right now, but that still happens to me, because college is totally different than high school, and I worry a lot about it. So when I laying down on the bed at the night, I was start thinking about college, can I make friends in college or what if the class that I take is going too fast then I don't understand what teachers are talking about. So I think four years high school would have more time to get ready for college.

Even know some programs are allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years, but think about that, if you and your friends didn't go to the same college, then you will have to leave them early and you also have to leave your family one year early.

Finally, I think traditional four years high school is more better then three years high school, and it makes you feel comfortable and have more time, instead squeeze the time together and make your self busy then others.

Those are my reasons to do a perform community and, I will like your school to participate with us on having a clean area to live in.

Thank you",3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.0
93BAA0D48EF3,"Adopted a four-day work week with each conisting of ten hours should my school follow up with this modle.

From my opion yes. Reason i think it should is beacuse we can have a 3 day weekend, spend more time with family, get enough sleep,if studnts have after school jobs they can have good hours. Like for example If my school have adopted a four day school week with each day two hours. It would help alot because i can go school do my two hours on Monday,Tuesday,Wedesnday, and Thursday and i feel like we could help out teachers alot not only studnets could help out staffs teachers and studnets . Have Friday Saturday Sunday off go work on my 3 day weekend get sleep spend time with my family get my sleep and naps. It would help alot and be more easier for others and myself. So yes i feel like our school should follow up with for day school week extending the school day two hours others students would not like it that way but teachers and studnets to but from my opinon yes i think our school should follow up with that .",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5
94ACF6006DB9,"My first opinion,

would be that to be a good person,

is you have to be your self no matter what is going to happen . For example a good behavior star at home because your parents have the responsibility to educate. Also some people said the students are very bad for other students, like they are bad influence .

My second, reason would be the your own problems can affect, your career. For example your grades at school if you are a good person with other people to be a good citizen just be you because people the just talk never do something good. But sometime teen don't deserve what they have for example school, job, people the they love them.

After that well, if you work that is a good idea because you can focus, and two things but if you are weak that will be a terrible decision . So a good behavior is excellent, because you always can find friends, and maybe a girlfriend but den pent of you.

In conclusion, if you are a good behavior you will be a good person, and the future, and a good guide for you children. Also if you are a good students,you will be have credit for college but you have to be a good behavior. So the mean, that you responsibility is work very hard to complete your goals. And help other people, who need help because the would make you a good behavior.",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.5
94C1C9CD10B7,"'If the school adds one hour and thirty minutes in a schools day'' honestly i dont agree nor disagree their some pros and con with this topic. The pros are that you learn more its good because schools get out earlier for the summer so their more summer days to enjoy. Another pro is if you have question on your homework the teacher can help you out by teaching you and you dont have to worry about the time because you have plenty of minutes to learn. Second If their were longer classes kids will lean more things and pay attention,if its their favorite class well it will be good for them because its longer. For me I love music class if i have more time in that class i could learn more things about music and i could be better player. Third pro it give us more time to hang out with our friends because your could be busy because they sports or church. Well for me i cant hangout with my friends because i have strict parents they wont let me get out of the house unless i have good also they don't let me hang out with friends so the only way i can see them is at school. Fourth pro is you can get to know your teacher and the students in the class you can learn many new thing about the teacher that you would never know about sometime its cool to hear their story because it could teach you something or can make you laugh. So i learn that their many good thing of having more time in a school day.

The cons of having one hour and thirty minutes in school day. First con is kids will be tired and they wont think that much or pay attention because all their energy is gone. The kids will be rude and wont do anything because they are tired or hungry. Well the only way to fix this to give them snack yeah that could help but how your going get the snack you have to buy them with money they are going to tell the kids to buy the snacks and the schools wont buy it. Second con is if the kid has doctor appointment they will go and the next day they will miss a lot of stuff in class and they make it up and the teacher wont teach it again because they have to move on and learn something new. Third con is classes will be harder because you have remember a lot of stuff for the test that your going to have that week. Honestly for me everyday when i get home i take a nap if dont have that nap i will be mad all night so many other kid could be just like me when they dont get a nap they are really rude so that bad for them ant the teachers also you will see kids falling asleep and teacher will yell at them. So i learn that their many not so great things of having more time in school.

In the end they are many good like getting help for work and their may bad things like getting tired. So having more time in school is good and bad .    ",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0
9532BA8E40BA,"why is better to have summer break than have it in different time of the year? Some educators feel that the summer break is too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall,and some people argue that should be year-round schools, where there would be a 3-4 weeks break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. I disagree that students should have a year-round schools because students will not learn if they have many breaks during the year, students would not have enough time with their families, and friends, also students would have hard time to do their work.

First, Students will not learn if they have many breaks. I think that is better if students have summer break than have it in different sections of the year. for example; if students want to travel to other state for vacations they would have to travel a week before so they can have fun, but students have to come back a week before school start, and they will forget what have they been learning the pass months. the main point of this example is that there is no point of doing a year-round schools, because that would affect students.

second, students would not have enough time with their family, and friends. Students travel every summer to other states to visit their families, and friends. for example; Most of the students travel every summer to other states or countries, but if students have year-round schools they will not have enough time to have fun with their families, and friends, also they would make less plans, because students would have to come back a week before the school start. from this example the main point is that students should have their vacations in the summer, and not in different sections of the year because they take time to those students, and when they go back to school they will not make any effort to do what they suppose to do.

third, students would have hard time to do their work. they would not have enough time to complete their worksheets from school, because they were having fun with their families, and friends in other countries. for example; if most of the students travel to different countries or states, and when they come back home students will be tired, and lazy to do their work, but if they have summer vacations they will be exited to go to school, retain information as easily when they come back. from this example the main point is that students should have summer vacations so they can be exited when they come back to school, and be great during the school.

finally, students would be more time in the school learning more, and paying attention to the teachers, also they will get their work done more faster, and students would be more positive to pass their SOL'S. Although students would be more successful in school.        ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0
960D7C072801,"Hello Mr. Manager I would like to vist your work space. Visiting your work space could help me learn about how you work and everything. Visiting your work space can help others understand what your do. Visiting your company could help understand how things are made at your company and what your goal is for the future of your company. This visit will help me understand how the people are too.

Visiting your company could help people understand what you do at your work space. Looking at a work space can help people see what the company is working on. Also at a company while they are working help people see how things are here and if they like it or not. Letting people see your work space will let them know what kind of company this is.

Opening your company to people would help them understand what kind of things you need to work here. This could help chosing colleges and schools. Instead of wasting time looking all the colleges looking here could help narrow the options a bit. Knowing what course to take will help me pick what college I want and will help me narrow the list instead of looking all over the place.

Letting people vistit your company would them see what your working on. Letting them come in and everything could help them know what they might be getting in the future. Helping people understand is a good way to keep your company out there in the world.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.0
96A7646236BF,"I agree with him because, we all have a specific dream or mission we want to accomplish and every dream or mission have a standard end point on less you expecting something far more better than what you are having or where you are at that particular time or moment.

Taking myself as an example or personal experienced person,I had always wanted to be a model when I was kid which I still want to be, but one thing have noticed is that you can't do anything on your own without sometimes you need help from people around you. Becoming a model was my idea and something I think it will be better for me and nothing beyond that standard; was calling people for help, applying from one agency to the other but there was no help. Sometimes people even want to take advantage of that to use for their satisfaction(sexually) even though I know that is bad I still wanted to do it because of the goals I have set for myself .

But then I got to realize I have to wait for the right time to come else people will take advantage of me. If I had never mastered it wouldn't have any experienced and would have never grow because I thought it was easy.

Life haven't be easy after loosing my dad some years ago,used to have a lot of plans in the nearest future with my dad. Was planning on graduating and buying a big house for us when I find myself a good job, but since I lost him everything just shattered and i don't know what to do. Am now living with my mom and step dad so they the ones providing for me; I don't work,I can't buy personal stuff and that makes me feel bad ,it makes me feel like am not doing anything in this world. Sitting idle will never let me grow until I do something better for myself.

In my opinion we have to set a goal for ourselves at a certain point so that we won't rush or stuck in between things , and also not everybody or anybody have to master things before they take a step and things work out for them well, some even have experience from childhood.",3.5,2.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0

People treated you bad becuase they want to accomplish their goal that is break you into pieces but, if you don't let those commen, actions hurt you everything is going to okay. Last year there were some girls that detely were hurting me my feels. In adition, Every day they would told me dress good you have to be like this act like you are a model; They would also make fun of me too because i was dressing so poorly. i was wearing the same shoes every day same pants. When they saw me they would make the face like they were going to trow up. Therefore, i never let them make my self esteem go down. I was so possitive also my family give me good vibes too, They would told me you know were you wanna get at. You know your goals those are the want you have to pay attention to.

Inconclution, don't let people make you something else. Some people think that you are going to change because they want but, they are wrong because you can be however makes you feel great with yourself. In the future i see that nobody is going to judge you.     ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5
982053C6DAD6,"Taking advantage of opportunities at a young age will significantly impact your future abilities of choosing your correct career path. Futhermore, when you're young, you have more time to research about the career that you are interested in. Most teenagers at a young age choose multiple careers of what is most interesting and cool looking to them. What's very important is that the particular person is willing to pursue in that career. At a younger age, most children get encouraged by their parents to love a specific subject. Nonetheless, depending on the subject that a teenager likes, that'll most likely be the career they pursue. It may also not be the career path they choose since it differs as they grow. When you're at a young age, you tend to gather information quickly, and also learn quicker.

Parents make sure that their child not only succeeds in life, but also chooses the carrer they believe is most fit for their desire. Choosing a career may include lots of pressure and thinking. It's always best to talk to your parents for advice, or to speak with your teachers. The parents may sign their child up for activities they think would be identical to their career choice. Most teens would feel that their parents only wanted them to pursue in a career that they have, or from a family legacy as tradition. Nevertheless, it's always important to have a young aged teenagers opinion about their career path as well.

Teens at a young age tend to become more interested in careers more than adults. It's a fact that a teenagers brain consumes

the information quicker then it would if an adult had. Being freshly exposed to a career at a young age benefits the teenager for future desires. It'll give the teenager some time to think about what careers he/she wants to get into, and how she/he is going to do it.

When there is a young aged teenager, it's best that they gather information slowly, and step-by-step. For example, youtube videos upon the career, games, and movies. Every young adult would prefer some entertainment with a little bit of knowledge, and facts being thrown at them. These activities will satisfy the teenager, and It'll be the introduction to their future career path. Teenagers play an important role in today's generation. It is vital that they should have some experience or knowledge upon what career they want to obtain, and become successful in.

High school provides plenty of options for young adults, espesically programs and clubs that they could attend. High schools also provide AP courses, which is an advance placement course. These courses will be a bit difficult, but will benefit the teenager of whichever career they want to achieve. It's always necessary for your teenager to stop by, and speak to his/her counselor once in a while to check up on his/her grades, and how she's doing overall.

The counselor will provide him/her the best information needed to achieve the teenagers goal.

When providing options to a young age teenager, it's best that you make it seem less work as possible. Teenagers most likely wouldn't like the sound of work, and would much rather hear about electronics, or the new clothing line at hot topic. Nevertheless, it's an exquisite idea to make sure that a teenager begins choosing his/her career during high school, so they could be more accurate with it once they are old enough. It will give the brain enough time to obsorb all the information they learn, and use it for the future.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0

Is it really true that Imagination is more important than knowledge.

Thesis

I honestly disagree with this knowledge is important.

Claims

Knowledge is more important than Imagination.

Can Imagination be helpful to you.

Imagination can happen to some people.

Knowledge is more important that Imagination

Knowledge helps your future become successful so how will Imagination help you. It wouldnt really help you just by seeing things with your head. Lets say you played would you rather would you rather have good knowledge or have Imaginations. Is there a way for Imagination to help you?

Can Imagination be helpful to you

Seeing things with your head wont help anything ,but it might help you if you think of anything it will just appear ,although, its not really there. Lets say you want a snow day you just Imagine its snowing outside but you still have school and theres not really snow there. Some people do Imagine things but why?

Imagination can happen to someone

A person starts to imagine things when he or she feels alone ,so he or she starts to think of an imaginary friend and they think that helps them not feel alone. Say that you just played your new game and you start to imagine in your head how fun the game was ,and what things you did in the game. Lets see what we learned.

Conclusion

That was all my reasons why I disagree what Albert Einstein said. Knowledge is more important than Imagination, what can Imagination do to help you, Some people can start to Imagine and think that it will help them. those where my reasons why i disagree.",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5
985FC4A0FAE2,"Some school are offering distance learning ash an opportunity for a student attend classes from home by way of online or video conference. I think this would be a good idea because is offering a good opportunity for people that can not be able to attend the school during the morning for other occupation personal and give a chance to get the diploma .Also is good opportunity to the people the can not be able to attend classes because they work. Is good opportunity for the people that can not attend classes and miss school because they do not have transport to go school. But is amazing that can take one class online without attend to school that's a lot of benefit for people that don't work .Is offering a big opportunity to take the class at home and do not drive every day to the class in the school.

Being able to to attend classes by home online is a good opportunity because not all school is offering the chance to take classes by home online. Taking classes online can improve the student and offering the opportunity to graduate without attend the schools and miss classes for not reason. This would be more benefit because some student skip classes when they go to school so they are losing his grades. But with the opportunity doing online student can make the class and not skip school and class for not reason.

Student can learn more with this benefit doing online because they can no get distracted by his friend of the side and can get more focus in the class online. for instance The students would be better doing the class online because when they go to school they get a lot of distracted and not put attention to the teacher when they talk .But online no body is making noise by your side and interruption to you that's helping to you a lot .Is good benefit to can graduated and doing all the think well online at home.

Some student can be more benefit because they have to work and be able to do online is good opportunity to all students can finish the school. For example they can finish extra work after they work a long they and be able the pass the grade doing all the step at home without go the school and miss the class offering the opportunity to do online without going anywhere just by doing online can be more benefit because can not be more stressing like in the school when you have to do a lot of work do not get the correct time to do it ,but when with this opportunity can be the best option to can finish late and extra work. and Also they don't have to find a transport to go to the school every day they only have to join online and make the work.

Finally i think this opportunity is huge benefit for the people the don't have the chance to go the school and for those students that need to graduated because they have to do a lot of think but want to get his diploma this can be the best opportunity for those people that want to be some one in his future some people have to work hard every day and they don't have good opportunity to finish they high school but in this school they offering a huge benefit that give to us a opportunity to take classes online that's going to be for me the best opportunity the i never seen before in schools .",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5
9860EE12D1B3,"In this competitive world people have to be a mastered in many things, but people are used to work in places that they are in comfort. Usually, people don't try to do something new that they are already do. What is the best advise to get growing? Ralph Waldo's statement is one, which motivates to others to explore new areas, and people will not grow, if they do always the same.

To begin, in the society there are many jobs where is necessary to expand in new areas to get improvement like photographers that usually work shooting pictures, but they know how to shot a video also. Photographers can explore new areas like cinematography world or work as a journalist. They know that explore new areas is best way to grow as professional. In addition, people already know that leaving the comfort zone is another way to get a personal growing like student that travels to another country to continue his studies or like a doctor how explores new medicine branches to find a cure for illness. Both have the knowledge that exploring areas that they commonly are no related, will help them to grow. Exploring new areas led everyone to get a growing.

To add, People will not be able to grow, if they don't change in order to grow. Persons that know how to do something very well, such as carpenter or construction, they decide to create their own businesses ,but they are scared to fail. They are afraid to do something new as manage a businesses even if they are mastered on it. Entrepreneurs should to undertake their companies, and they should to invest in new equipment try to grow. if they just keep doing the same without invest, they will not grow as company. In contrast, many people say if someone do always the same, they will be a professional in that area. like a professional sport player because they do always the same. However, even the professional sport player do something different every time, they have to improve their skill. If they just keep doing the same they can't play and be the best player either. This ideology is applied to many different areas where the subject want to be successful.

In conclusion, Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement has the reason, for people is not able to achieve their goal when they do constantly the same. People should explore beyond they are used to do in order to get growing. In many circumstances dare to do new things will gave people a benefit. Changes in live are always good it is just will to do it. People don't have to be mastered in one thing but many of them.",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5

I disagree with the old proverb because honesty might hurt peoples feels around you, honesty can make people not like you no more, and honey can not be used in a matter that you speaking of.

First when you tell people how you really feel about them it might hurt you in a way too, when people find out how you feel about them it can be good or bad, when people tell true about someone it may hurt them, and how people tell you how they feel about you it can be hurtful.

Second when you tell someone how much you do not care about them can make you look bad, when you have a friend that you tell stuff that you do not like about him can be hurtful, when you talk about people in front of them can not help your friendship with them, when you said hurtful things about them they will not like you any more,and how you tell people about what you do not like about them it can be harsh.

Finally when you tell people how you really feel in a different way can still be hurtful, the way you tell someone you do not like them can be more hurtful to them, when you speak of some one but in a different way can still grateful of hurtful, when you talk about someone in a nice vice but it can still be mean, and how you talk about someone is up to you no matter what you say.

First, i usually learn some knowledge about nurse in books or online. There's some books that people write their experience about how could they become a nurse, how the nurse job looks like and also some story that they have met. Actually i know, it's a hard job to learn, even my first language is not English, it become harder. But when i see the story, see the interesting experiment, i'm fascinated. Sometimes, i also go to find some volunteers about nurse, it always help me learn a lot that i can't learn from the book.

Second, i think to be a nurse is arrogant. People always say "" Nurse is just like an angle"", they help people from disease. As i said, i have read a story that makes me shake: Once in a night, the nurse was ready to finish her work, but suddenly, a man run in to the hospital and there's blood in his arm, he said somebody want to hurt him, that nurse keep him in to the restroom and called 911 first, she try her best to bind up his arm, she wrote in the book"" I'm so scary and my hand was shaking, but soon i clam down, i know i'm the hope for him"". This story makes me have different understanding about nurse, this job can even save people's life. What a mighty job it is!

For example if you fail on doing something, you will be exited on doing it again until you haven't pass because you might be thinking thats your dream to achieve it or its really important to achieve what i fail in it. I heard story of a guy he fail a lot but he didn't gave up because he was still interested on the experiment, so he failed like 408 time I think and he passed at 409th times so you can imagine that he was still exited and interested on that experiment that he failed 408 times and he got success at 409 times.

So in life when people failed on something they move on because they might not be interested or exited on that thing that they have failed but many other people will keep trying until they haven't achieve it. they will keep trying because they love it or they are still exited on that work that they have failed.

I know some people don't like doing one thing again and again but if you want to be success in life you have to keep doing it until you haven't achieve it because you can't be success in life without being a failure. when people failed on something they might say that its hard and i am not gonna do it again because they didn't try their best on it, but if you keep trying you will get some hint on it and it will be easier to achieve what you working on.

9A5193D1C19B,"Positive attitude is the key to success in life. It has a big impact in our life, and remove negatives thoughts in an incredible way. Also, if we do not start thinking in a positive form; life will be hard for us. Furthermore, positive attitude guarantee a different way of thinking it can change the way we are, and how our minds are more open to others opportunities. I agree with positive attitude because it can change our lives for a better future. Positive attitude is the thing that all humans needs in life.

Firstly, if we have a positive attitude our lives can change in the way that very few people can reach. For example, we will gain more opportunities to jobs like have a good recommendation of the society, finding jobs would not be that hard,

and gain to have more friendships. In addition, other case is the behave with the family that almost all young people has for example: having good communication, feel good around them, etc. Also, discussing with other people would not be a issue because we are prepare for how negative attitude appears in the persons who does not want to change the way of think. Moreover, our positive attitude can change the mood of a person.

Secondly, positive attitude improves our mind state in the way that negative thoughts cannot go into our brains. However, sometimes this negative thoughts can also ruin our day by putting obstacles like, the boss is angry and we do not know how to react, having a bad lunch, or no having enough hours of sleep. but, positive attitude has a big impact that right away make us think in a different way and make us feel secure. In sequence, an experience at school that all human being has is when we have a test and we are worry that we will not pass, the teacher comes and say ""is not a big deal, i know you all can do it"" and that is where positive attitude comes. Also, positive attitude has to influence in everybody, so we can have a better world.

Thirdly, we all are different, but we can try to improve our skills in positive attitude by reading books, listen to other people, and make a change in our habits. On the other hand, we can try to make contact with people that has positive attitude to the maximum, they will help us to see things from a different perspective of view. In addition, introducing new people in our lives will make a big change. Also, it will make us more responsible at the time that we have to read, write, or talk in an appropriate way. lastly, this will lead us to a better and different way of think; it will improve our knowledge.

Lastly, positive attitude can support us by building a better future for our lives. But, sometimes it can be difficult to manage our emotions. Positive attitude can improve us to do better in our emotions. It will make us strong in whatever situation we are passing through. A lot of people that are around us would not like it but, is a process that we want for be different than them. Positive attitude is ambition for those who wants to live better and wants to reach their dreams.",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0

9AFAE6562E98,"The purpose of always doing something helps us get different kinds of experiences, it helps us accomplishe what we are doing and gives a purpose to what we want to do in the future. Throughout life, the experiences that you get can help keep you motivated on what you should and shouldn't do as well. In comparsion, when you are inactive you aren't benefiting from anything and you are just not getting enough experience for what you want to do in the long run. This is a major factor on how well you live your life and how you want your life to be. I do suppoort that we accomplish more when we are always doing something and it helps contributes to how we all live our daily lives.

One factor why I believe that this contributes to our daily lives is that, it helps you get an education on something new or just a job that you are interested in. While, going to school and getting an education is a major rule in a human life; it is not for everyone and it all depends on how much effort you put in and if you are willing to put in the effort as well. In many different countries and cities, not all jobs require an education all you have to do is have experience in a certain area or part that makes you want to learn more. This helps decrease inactivity and upbulid activity while you are doing something like helping your community, feeding the homeless, giving advice to young kids. It all just depends on how well you put yourself out there and willing to make a committment about it as well.

A second factor why I believe you feel accomplished by doing something is that, it gives you a purpose in life and a feeling that won't be given again. From my experience of helping kids with their homework afterschool it has always given me always a good feeling and making me proud that I am helping the community. This helped me gain self-satification for myself and let me understand the importance of showing kids at a young age how to be accomplished when you put the energy and time too. Another example I ever felt when doing somethingis when I play lacrosse , and how everytime I don't make my mile time I strive to do better for myself. Lacrosse has helped me put in an understanding on how self-satisfication doesn't come easy it takes time and effort. This benefitted me get motivated for what I should do more and always helping me understand that if I put in my time and energy then there won't be a problem on feeling accomplished. Doing something you love and getting that satisfication helps you serve purpose and feel more accomplished for yourself as well.

One last example of how always staying active can help influence your accomplishment is that you are acknowledging that you are given a purpose to uphold. I do feel like many people don't seriously take the opportunites given and it is very hard to undertake as well. I would certainly always feel accomplished when doing something that can help let others know I care and not just for my own image. I agree that many different factors can influence decision making but also making others understand how important you are to someone as well.

In conclusion, the more work you put in ;the more you are in feeling accomplished and in pleasing yourself as well. This can help give you a self-esteem boost for yourself and let others know that you are willing to put in dedication for yourself. Many people that I have talked to said that they have always felt like their ciommunity helps them grow and feel like they should give something back as well. Doing something remotely even small can benefit anyone's day in comparsion in doing nothing. Working for what you need to do is different for working for what you want to do and this helps you understand the need for self -satisfication and social-satisfication. ",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0

I am in disagreement with this prompt that it has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change, because just imagine clearly your first impression it may not be the same when at first you start knowing someone, when at first you meet someone, or even when at first you look someone by the first time, people may also said that is impossible to assume your first impression at someone, because your perspective of someone may be different from another perspectives of others, you may have the same perspective or also different from other people.

The day when at first came to United States it was really hard for me and for my family from Mexico, I was really nervous and also a little scared, it was one of my dreams that became real, I was so impressed and surprised of everything, the first impression that I used to have of United States changed, now that I am living in United States, the impression is different because now I know how is to live in a different country. Not always is going to be how you thought it would be, but it can be even better, even thought your impression was different or was the same at the beginning.

The day I came to this school Generic_School, my impression from when I meet my counselor Generic_Name were different from my impression after I meet her, I thought she was going to be really mad and mean counselor or I even thought she was going to be a counselor that doesn't like Hispanic people, but all my thoughts were wrong, my impression was really wrong because my thoughts about her were wrong, now that I know how is my counselor, my first impression and perspective changed from the one that I used to have and believe.

In conclusion, as the end of this prompt that it has been first impressions are almost impossible to change is wrong, that is not believable because your first impressions and your own thoughts can be wrong, even though you thought it was going to be something at the end is not how you thought it was going to be, first impressions are possible to change because they can be wrong even though your perspective can be true, or it can be also wrong. Don't let first impressions to trick you because they may be wrong, you can change them if you want, but make sure to be secure.         ",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5
9B4BD1687FA0,"The quote says, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you already mastered, you will never grow."" I disagree with this statement. Because people need extend their studies, so that they can learn new important information that can benefit new research, also they can set new ideas, so they can make new studies and discoveries. Thirdly they can grow by teaching other people how to learn the same material . You can grow be doing a lot of different activities and teaching methods

First way to grow is to try to learn more by studying. This is an important factor to learn more about in full detail like Isaac newton he discovers the law of gravity because of an apple that fell on top of his head. Then he makes a lot of theories about what may cause such phenomenon, so he studied it by creating equations and and a math subject called Calculus. Their are many others for example: Shakespeare, Beethoven, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawkins, and Leonardo DaVince. These smart men did not stop because their is always something new to discover and grow.

Second way to grow is discovering new information. Every single day people learn something new, which is a benefit our society weather it's good or bad because you can have new ideas or discoveries. An example is cancer. A deathly decease that can kill you and there is no cure. Scientist are doing experiment on trying to find a cure and that takes a lot of time to gather information. These scientist do not stop even though they mastered science. They want to continue helping people from suffering this bad decease they want to grow and learn more they will not stop until they find a cure, so people can live as long as possible with their families.

Third way to grow is by teaching other people. Teaching other people can help you be a better person and letting people know your methods, so they can succeed with your help. Doing that will help yourself and other. It's another way to a good mentality, also you can grow bigger.

In conclusion there are different ways to grow even though you mastered it. That is why I disagree with this statement, and their is never enough or to good to learn. I will never get tired of learning new fascinating stuff about this world and the outer world.",3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5
9B5E142C63AC,"My Talent

A talent or skill is something that is unique about everyone. It takes time to develop a talent or a skill. A talent or skill basically is something you are good at doing. Many people have the ability to move their ears, but some don't. Most people like dancing and are good at it, so it is a talent. Around the world, many people have more than one talent. My talent is to sing and write music. Some people in the world haven't found their talent yet.

One way to develop talent is to try everything. If you try everything, you'll eventually find something you are good at. During this process you'll probably be trying different things you haven't done before, like sky diving. Even though finding a talent or skill might sound hard and take some time, it can be done easily. By trying everything you can find many actives you might be interested in. Soon, those activities might become a talent or skill. Sometimes by trying everything, you might not be able to find your talent, but you can always look at it another way. Trying different strategies can be helpful to find a talent as well.

Another way to develop a skill or a talent is to make a checklist. You can make a checklist about the activities you would like to try. Most researches say, a talent is something you are interested in doing. If you are interested in baking, it might soon become one of your talent or skill. Simply by making a checklist, you can find many interests. Even though there are a lot of steps for making a checklist, you'll will find a talent or skill soon.

The third way to develop a talent is to go outside. If you go outside, you will learn and experiences many things you didn't know. Many people these days are stuck in there electronics and never notice the world outside of them. If you go outside and explore you'll find many interests and enjoy them. The world outside of us is big and has a lot to offer and has opportunities, like cooking, acting, sing, and e. t.c. There is so much that awaits in the world.

Everyone has a talent or a skill, if not, they can find one eventually. Three ways to develop a talent or skill is to try everything, make a checklist on activities that interests you, and go outside. These three ways can help you find a talent and your talent may help you find career. Sometimes the activities you are interested in and are good at doing, might not be your talent, because skills and talents can just be hard to find. A talent or a skill is something that is unique and plays a good role of describing who you are. ",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5
9BAE37CAB3ED,"Dear Teacher,

I think that working in group or working alone has some advantages and disadvantages. But in my opinion I would say that one that is more beneficial is working in a group. Working in a group is less work and more ideas.

As I was saying that their are advantages and disadvantages, My first advantage of working alone is that you get to work alone with no distraction from others. Second advantage is that you can focus and ask the teacher for help. Last reason is that you can put as many ideas you want and a lot of effort and ask the teacher to check your work to see how you doing working. The disadvantage of working alone is that you will not get the work done faster. My second reason is that working alone is not fun because you working independent and doing all the work.

My first advantage is that working in group you get to hear different ideas from each other. My second advantage is that you can talk together and gets lots of ideas and fix mistakes together. Last advantage is that working in a group you can finish the work faster. The first disadvantage is that working in a group their is going to be too much talking and also not focusing. Second disadvantage is that when you are working together some times one person does the whole work and the other doesn't. Last disadvantage is that you can easily get destructive and not get the work done.

To conclude this I think working in a group is more beneficial. I choose working in group because their are many advantages. Therefore working in a group is less work and turning in work fast, As a result you won't have to worry about asking for help or not having ideas because thats is why you are in a group to get your work done and have a lot information.

Sincerely,

9C37912D9442,"I think that failure is the key to success in life, That means that without having any obstacles you are not going to succed. Churchchill's is right that failure is the pursuit of success. You have to try to do what you want to do.

If you have a dream to become someone you want to fight for it. Make good choices and try hard. Sometimes is hard to achieve your dreams, because maybe you are not capable to do things or you don't know how or where to start. You can ask for help to your parents, teacher, and people outside of school, so they can help you with something. People make mistakes, And they learn from it. You have to try over and over to do what makes you happy. You can fall down one or three times, but you have to get up many times you can.

Make a plan, and write down the things that you want to do, and don' t be shy to ask for help when you needed. Be a enthusiam person, If you fail to do something try to do it again. Nothing is easy in life, with effort everything is possible. If you are in school try to do your best at school and ask questions to your teachers. For example: I am a high school student. At first I was a very shy person, well I'm still a shy person but not like I was before. I was shy to ask for help to my teachers and whenever I needed help I didn't know what to do because I was shy and quiet. At first I did't know how to ask for help, but then I realize that without asking for help to my teachers I was not going to succed, and I would never learn how to do things.

I was also shy to asked my parents to help me with something, so everytime I needed something I used to go locked my self in my room and figuring thing out, But I also learn to ask them for help, even though they don't speak english, they still helped me with my school work. You have to do the same thing and ask for help to a trusted adult that can help you, so you can succed in your life, If you have bad friends stay away from them, because they are not good people and you are going to end up ruining your life.

I believe that if you fail, try to do it again. Do what makes you happy and succed in your life. Make an effort and achieve your dream, because you are living of that, And if you fall down get up and do it again.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
9C3D2911E32D,"Have you ever thought of the affect of going out after 10 p. m. at night? Night time is the scariest period of the day; nothing is more dangerous and harmful than at night. People would rather stay at home than going out at night. A city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because it is safer, teenagers can stay out of trouble and they can have more time to spend with their family.

However, some people think that curfews would unfairly interfere in young people's lives because they might have an emergency and everyone has freedom to do what they want. In some cases, for instance, teenagers might have an emergency or something important at night that they need to be there as soon as possible, city council cannot let them stay at home. It will be unfair if other people can go out at night, but not teenagers. Everyone has freedom to do what they want, others cannot force teenagers to stay at home everyday after 10 p. m. at night. Although some people think that having curfews are not a good idea, I still insist that the adoption of curfews for teenagers would be a fantastic idea.

In the first place, a city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because it is safer. It is very scary if teenagers hang out at night because someone might follow or kidnap them without they notice. No one knows what is going to happen next. Staying at home not only keep teenagers safe, it also make them be caution to everything around them. Furthermore, teenagers need to protect themselves from others, so that they will not get hurt. In short, it is necessary to adopt curfews for teenagers because they will be safer.

Additionally, it is important for teenagers to have curfews because they can stay out of trouble. Teenagers nowadays have a very playful mind and they would do anything to enjoy themselves; however, they can get into trouble very quickly. Curfews can prevent and stop teenagers from breaking the law. They can stay at home and do something productive and meaningful to themselves. Moreover, curfews can prevent teenagers to meet harmful people outside of the society and make a bad decision. Therefore, a city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because they can stay out of trouble.

Lastly, it is a great idea for a city council to adopt a 10 p. m. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers because they can have more time to spend with their family. Spending time with their family is the best moment that nobody wants to miss. Instead of going out with people below standard and breaking the rules, teenagers can have a wonderful time with their family at home. Because of curfews, the relationship between teenagers and their family will grow and be healthier. To sum up, it is nice to have curfews because it helps build up a better relationship.

In conclusion, it is the best idea to have a city council adopt curfews for teenagers because it can protect teenagers from danger and risk, they will less likely get into future conflicts, and they can have an enjoyable time to spend with their family. Curfew benefits both teenagers and the law. Curfews can raise the world to a higher level and make a clean society for all teenagers. Let's make the adoption of curfews come true!

9CB6D9467227,"I agree that a positive attitude is the key to success in life because people are Motivated , Happier and Work harder. Many people disagree that having a positive attitude doesn't mean anything and others think it makes a huge impact in success. Many studies have shown that having a positive attitude helps people succeed better and is a key.

First, I truly believe that if you really stay motivated and I'm convinced that I want to be successful, I continue to push myself each time I want to give up. When I pay attention to the certain things I want to achieve. I give dedication when I want one specific thing and try not to worry about other things that aren't related to what I want or succeed. I try to stay as focused as possible because once I'm determined and make that my main focus, then It'll make me want to keep my positive energy towards my goal.

Secondly, If I want to have a positive energy I must remain Happy. If I truly believe in myself then I will continue to have a positive energy, but even if

I

don't believe in myself I will remain to have a positive energy and a positive attitude. By succeeding with a positive attitude I must prioritize my goal making it my first reason to stay positive and to work harder. Keeping it always in my mind and reminding myself; for example "" oh this is what I have to look for"" or ""this will help me by succeeding my goal I want to achieve"", those two examples are ways to bring it to my mind all the time and remember what I need to be looking for.

Thirdly, If I work harder by putting my all into it and dedicating my time and keeping my positive energy then that's one way i can always succeed. By keeping my energy positive and succeeding I will make work twice as much as I need to for my goal to come true. If I know i truly want that goal and what to succeed I won't give it up that easily because that will be my main focus and my main priority.

Having a positive attitude is a huge key to succes because people get motivated, happier and work harder for what they are trying to achieve in life. Many people disagree that having a positive attitude is a key to success and others think it's a huge difference when you do because that's peoples main focus in life. Always have a positive attitude for the things a person including yourself may want in life! ",2.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0
9DB8409B95F6,"It was a really nice day so we went to the park. We were going down the slide at the park, and I was with my brother, and sister. If I haven't told you what their names are, I'll tell you right now! My brother's name is Generic_Name, and my sister's name is Generic_Name, My name is Generic_Name. My siblings are pretty annoying, but I still love them. It was really sunny, and warm, Then this cute guy came, and right away I text my friends about it.

My brother somehow started playing with Generic_Name. Generic_Name told me he already knew Generic_Name. He had a really cute little sister, and she's two years old, and her name is Generic_Name, and Generic_Name is ten years old.

I asked Generic_Name what his brother's name was, he told me it was Generic_Name. When Generic_Name told me his brother's name, my heart started beating really fast, I was really happy that I would do anything in this world.

Generic_Name comes up to me, and says hi, I was really nervous, me and Generic_Name were talking while are siblings were playing. We got to know each other, and now we're best friends.

I'm so glad I met Generic_Name! We have so much things in common, we both like the same sport, which is soccer. The saddest thing is that we don't go to the same school, I go to Generic_School, and he goes to Generic_School. We got each others instagram, snap chat, and our phone numbers.

We all wanted to hang out again, but tomorrow It's going to rain, and It's going to be really muddy, and wet outside. We got home, and we ate dinner, we all took a shower, and did our night routine. I had so much notifications from my friends, I totally forgot i sent them a text, I told them everything that happened. We had school tomorrow, and me and my friends were talking about it, but Generic_Name didn't seem as happy, as we all did. She told me she needed to talk to me, but in secret. So we went to the library. Generic_Name told me she knew Generic_Name, and she told me so much bad thing about Generic_Name. Generic_Name is Generic_Name's ex girlfriend.

I was very upset, and started crying, I went straight to my house, and Generic_Name came with me too, she's my best friend, and she's always there for me, when I really need her the most, I told Generic_Name what Generic_Name told me. Generic_Name told me that all those bad things she told me about Generic_Name aren't true, she did that, so I would stop liking Generic_Name. I called Generic_Name that I needed to talk to him, so I gave Generic_Name my address.

Generic_Name came over, I told him everything that Generic_Name told me, he told me she was lying, because she's jealous of me, and she liked him, but Generic_Name didn't feel the same way as Generic_Name did.

Generic_Name told me that he liked me since the time, he made eye contact with me. I really didn't expect Generic_Name telling me that, I thought he would never like me. I don't trust a lot of people just my best friends, and my most favorite teacher, because the people that care about you the most, are the ones that want the best for you, they're not jealous of you, like Generic_Name was. Girls shouldn't change over a guy that doesn't feel the same way as you do, and boy's shouldn't either! God has someone waiting for you!

If you really trust someone, don't loose their trust! A lot of people can give bad or good experience to you, but you have to see who's being a bad friend to you, and who's being a good friend to you. There are a lot of people that can give you bad influence, and a lot of people can give you good influence. Be careful in who you trust, there are several people that are there for you no matter what. If there is something wrong with you, talk to the person you feel more confident talking to, you can talk to your mom, dad, your principle, counselor, dean, or anyone you truly trust.

There's always a time where you accept some bad friendships, that give you bad influence, but it's okay. I did to for accepting my friendship with Generic_Name, if she really was a good friend, she would of told me she wants the best for me, and not lie about something that isn't even true, When someone lies to you, it's hard for you to gain their trust. You have to learn your lesson to the people that lie, your realize how you loose friends by just lying.

Me and Generic_Name are now dating, we are focusing in school, because school is important, and no matter what others say, me and him are going to be happy, and no one will ever change that.

9DE684107A66,"should churchill's statement About the importnat role that failure plays in the pursuit of success be true. I think that failure plays a big role to success but is just for those who really want to changed their lifes. First of all, learned something from any failure. Second of all, A failure shows up the real people. Third and most important, try not to do the same failure over and over.

""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiams"". First of all,learned something from any failure because we are humans and we all make big mistakes in our lifes. Those who learned form their mistekas are the best to help the ones that are passing the same process. Learn because there would be always more failures in our lifes. Second of all, a failure shows up the real people because those who you think are good friends would help you on a failure. the person that you thought was the worst could be the only one helping you. An example, A real girlfriend would never run away in your first failure. Third and most important, try not to do the same failure over and over becuase the first think you loss is your enthusiams when you had been passing the same failure for many times, it becomes harded not to loss it. There is always gonna be more failures in our lives but, if u dont even pass one it would be more difficult to pass more then one at the same time.

My conclusion, everyone has a failure or more in their lifes but the most succes full thing of a failure is to pass the page knowing that you had learned something good of it and you wont do the same mistake ever again.

Not many many other schools have this program to get extra help and kids need to understand that the there is a big opportunity that is being given to them and they need to take it.

This program helps the younger students get a opportunity to get better at something that they are having a hard time on inside of school.

If the kids are having a hard time on doing work at home or not understanding, they dont have to get worried about there grades dropping because there are other options that you can do.

If the younger kids parents do not have that much time to sit and help them with work, then they can just get help from the learning program that happens at there school.

The more you go to the meetings the better you will get even if it takes time.

First, Students may find that the class is not of interest to them because they may want to learn about other subjects that could impact their future. Due to the students dissatisfaction and not being interested in the class they have a high probability for failure. For example, Generic_Name wants to reach his goal of going to a high end college but was not accepted because he had a GPA lower than the minimum requirement due to failing drama class.

Second, Students can also have an interest in a certain job. Music, drama, or art can be a waste of time for the student because it is taking time from classes that can help towards getting that job. Taking these classes could also help the student explore more possible job opportunities as well as learning skills.

Lastly, Some students would not take these classes serious. As oppose to essential classes like math, English, and history students would use these classes as an opportunity to horseplay. The students that are constantly participating in horseplay are going to be a distraction to the students trying to succeed in these subjects.

In conclusion, I believe music, drama, and art should classify as an elective because students may find that the class is not of interest to them, students can also have an interest in a certain job, and some students would not take these classes serious and take it as an opportunity to horseplay.

Positive attitude is the right choice it's like a no brainer. Also you will be happy, like who dosen't like to be happy. Finally positive attitude will bring success to your life and the people around you.

First reason is attitude effects the people around you in a different way. If you see someone who is feeling down go help them. If your always positive you'l get things done the right way without being stressed.

another reason success is great good things will happen around you even if you don't suspect it. Success will get you to wherever you want to be, but you have to be positive. If your positive, and a teenager you could nail your first interview you just got to be positive.

Final reason is be your self it's so important because being unique means your special and something good will happen to you in life. People will love who you are when you are yourself ,and get real friends who will help you. Don't be like everybody trying to be the same like every body.

9F9C42BD3B7A,"We live in a world where each and everyone of us, will always need someone or others to rely on. In this world not everyone is born complete. However being yourself is always good, but you can also change yourself if you feel the need to. But if someone else were to change you then that would be very bad, because they could be either delusional or emotionally negative of certain things in life. When your being yourself on my opinion it means you shouldnt have others change the way you are but its up to how you feel about yourself.

I strongly disagree Emerson's statement on how individuality is a good thing, and i have various reasons or examples on this statement. I have many important people like my mom,dad,sister, and very close friends who are also like family to me. Having other people is vital because you get through life more easily, and able to change yourself as you live on. But if you got rid of all of that then you would probably live a lonely life in deep and total solitude. Having other people isnt trivial, you have to have faith in one another to get through life.

There was this one time where i was about twelve to fourteen years old, i would always struggle with my grades in the beginning of the school year, and have a strong sense of unease everyday i go to school because i always felt like wouldnt be able to provoke my self to do better in school and get better at socializing. I was only caring for myself most of the time, and when i get back home i would feel depressed and repugnant. But that all changed later when i realized i needed to have others to help me. As time went on i was able to change myself by others around me. The world isnt changing you you are changing yourself by just living a life with others around you, and you wouldnt notice that you changed either, but that is a good thing because now you know that if your able to change then anyone should be able to.

The last thing that is bad when you dont have anyone else with you, is that it can be really boring and not fun at all. When your all alone in your life, you wont have anyone to socialize with you, and keep you company. But when you have a lot of friends and get to know other people, you can have an experience with them and its what makes life really entertaining. When your with your friends you get to have lots of fun, like play games together, socialize, travel together, and get to have more and more experiences with each other and maybe learn more lessons in life. Theres a lot of people who think that we live in a society where no one cares about you and doesnt want to help you at all. but thats not true because it isnt there fault, because when you have others with you, it can have an effect positively and negatively. And people who are negative all the time can provoke others to be a bad person, which is why they end up all lonely because they fear of others or hate others because they think no one cares about them. But thats not true because all it takes is to change yourself, by having others in your life, or asking for help.

In conclusion individuality can be pretty awful and lead others to a path that is bad. Having others in your life is necessary because we can lift each other up, no one is worthless. Leaving someone on there own can be pretty sad, helping them is what makes you a better person and gives you a better and easy life. But as i said dont let anyone change who you are, being yourself is good but being alone simultaneously can be a bad thing. You are the protagonist of your own life, your life is your own.",4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5

So then I started playing more and more of it, and then I started playing in tournaments and leagues. I started of in defense, then I started to up my way up, so then in three weeks I started playing striker. When I started playing soccer I used skills like communication,passing and shooting so then my coach said I had potential in me. So then I started to watch soccer in my T.V..Soccer got famous in the late 1800's. Also in soccer you had to work hard and train hard. Like professionals they worked for 5 to 8 hours a day. Well in soccer games I use communicating,dribbling,passing and shooting.

In my opinion communicating is the most important soccer talent professionals need. Professionals need communication to score or win a match. For example my soccer team always use communication to pass to even score, and to win the match. Pele was a young Brazilian when he went to the world cup finals, he was only 18. His position was striker, he was known for his bicycle kick in the 80 minute. In 1900 professional in different leagues used communication also to pass to ball. Everybody needs communication to win any sport game.

In my opinion you need skills to be good at the game. In one of my games I had to score two goals at least to win the finals in soccer then I two use my skills called the fake. In 2009 there was a player named Lionel Messi he plays for Generic_City and won six ballon d'or. He used skills in games and in training. In my other soccer matches I used skills like passing and dribbling in a soccer matches. There was a player named Ronaldo he played for Generic_City when I was born, so I saw one of his soccer games in the T.V and I looked how he used other skills in the match against Generic_City. So I trained for an hour before my soccer tournament. So then I used one of his skills and it worked. So I used his skills for two games. So I saw professional players skills, so I can use those professional skills in a soccer game.

In my opinion you have to work hard and train hard because if I don't I wont be active so those are my other soccer skills because I train to learn moves, running, and defense. I train everyday so I can get better and better. Other professional have to train everyday to win other soccer matches and communicate with other teammates. I also practice dribbling a lot in my soccer practice. I use it a lot in soccer matches and I really good at it. In 2008 there was a player called Alex Hunter he was a rookie, then he started training and training until he gotten famous and good at soccer. I train everyday when that happened to someone.

If everybody tried to play soccer it wouldn't be boring because it's fun, you can play with family members or friends, and you can know new people.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,2.5,3.5

A04B4B412DB3,"The school board should add an hour and a half hours of school to each school day. Do you agree with this? Three reasons why school board should add an hour and a half hours to school are, students wouldn't have much homework, schools could add another elective to the day, and teachers get more teaching time. Help me do this!

The first reason why I believe the school board should add an hour and a half hours to the school day is students wouldn't have much homework. Most students have responsibilities after they get home from school. Some have responsibilities at home, work, and sports. Most students take care of their siblings when they get back from school. Others work after school and don't have time to do their homework. Also a huge amount of students have after school sports either inside or outside of the school, sometimes both.

The second reason why the school board should add an hour and half hours of school to each day is because schools could add one more elective. Studies show people become disinterested in an activity within an hour. If schools added one more elective to the school day most students would be on board with the hour and a half idea. Some people naturally like school and they want the hour and a half thing to happen. Instead of the elective this class could also be a study time for students that are struggling with a class or an assignment. This could help students grow their brain because they would try to understand it, instead of just giving up.

The last reason why an hour and a half hours should be added is teachers would get more teaching time. Teachers tend not to explain some topic well because they run out of time. Students don't ask questions because usually they run out of time. Sometimes the teachers is explaining to another student because they didn't quiet get it either. This doesn't mean the teacher doesn't know how to teach, it means the teacher made an effort to teach as fast as possible so he or she wouldn't run out of time.

The school board school board should add one hour and a half hours to each school day. Three reasons why I think this should happen are students wouldn't have much homework. schools could add one more class or elective,and teachers would have more time to teach. Do you agree with me? If you do help me make this happen!",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5
A0D47C0DD67F,"Individuality is the idea of freedom of thoughs, but why we are concerned what other people think? Let's be honest everybody had copied at least one time in a test or quiz just because it was more eassy to coppy than being trying to remember the anwer that obviously you did not know. We own our thoughs, thus, we should do ours ideas not somebody else's ideas

In the book called ""Maria Magdalena"" based in the movie ""The Davinci code"" states the ideas of one individual who thalk about the true behind the story about Maria Magdalena ( Jesus' mother). To catholic people Jesus's mother is saintly. Their sanctuary, the church. To the author of the book ""Maria Magdalena"" she is just a lie's layer. On those old times there were many poor people who were opressing by the church, they sufer in the church's hands. The church killed to protect the true behind Maria Magdalena. On those times existed the crusades in spanish the ""cruzadas"" in which the church fought the protestants to convert them in their cristianity if they negated to accept it they killed them. The victims decide to follow their own beliefs and the consequence was the death. This is a good example of individuality similar to our way to live in the present. The politics want us to do what they want to their advantages opressing our rights just like the church did with the protestants during the crusades. The author of ""Maria Magdalena was very brave to wrote about those things. He was very successful because nobody used to talk about this, now they do. In this book he shared us a little part of what was to be different from the others and take their own decitions. Based on this I state that we can share our ideas of individuality and do not let our corrups politics to opress people's rights.

In the present we have a huge amount of successful guys because of individuality. The influential ideas of the past are not in our day to day anymore. Parents now teach their offspring to take their own decitions knowing the consequences of this. Now we, the tenageers, are more prepared to develop our ideas and beliefs. Constantly, my mom develop the ideas of individuality in our family. One year ago I decided to start to work, and I am very proud of my decittion.

I remember my first day of kinder garden, All the kids playing and runnig around the field. To be honest, I prefer being painting rather than be runnig for no reason. My art's teacher gave us draws made by her.""Ready to paint"" she used to say, but I was so rebel that I made my own draws just because I though her draws were so bored. I was a little girl taking individuality decitions and I did not know it

In my conclusion I am agree with individuality, If we want to spread the individuality, then we should start saying what we think, because the bravery of the unexpected ones, will persuade the shyness ones. Individuality can be hard but not impossible. We live in a world with influencers that try to persuade us to be like them. Do not choose the easy way. I prefer the hard way, so then I would be proud of my achievement just like Ralph waldo Emerson said: ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplisment""",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0
A1196779A15B,"Do I think we choose our traits? In this world people choose their pathway. What they want to be in life. What career they want to do in the future. Some people have not figure out what they want to do in their life. It is always up to yourself to make life choices and some people like to listen to other people ideas but not listen to themselves. Humans like to listen to their friends or family members ideas too see if they can help them out. I think people like to listen to others people ideas but their own idea which is showing they can not make their choices by themselves.

Many of the humans depend on their friends or family being their to help them out. Being part of this life is learning how to make choices by yourselves and going out in the world and making yourselves an adult. Kids that turn sixteen start looking for jobs so they can grow and see how the money and dealing with customers works. When I turn sixteens years old I went out to look for jobs i wanted that feeling where I could earn money. People would make fun of me for working at a thrift store. At that time I cared what people would say about me and I told my manger that the job was not for me. I would listen to people comments but it was not worth it because they are not going to be there in the future. The point is we let people make our choices when we can do it ourselves but we like to depend on others.

Some people can feel like the world make their choices. Someone who you do not know about can judge you for no reason. Some people feel like they have to make everyone happy but not make themselves happy. When it comes on choosing who will be our next president not a lot of people like to tell others who they will vote for because there is always a person who will say something about it. There was a time when I was in my government class and a student asked what i thought about our president and his issues. I told him how i felt and instead of telling that he agreeing with me he told me how wrong I am and I did not know anything about the issues and how the president is trying to slow it. It can always be a person who you do not know trying to make your choices. Even though sometimes we make our mistakes however I feel like we depend on others

When it comes to make out choice we like to learn from experience we been through. We like too watch other people do it or we like to do it ourselves. I think it happened too be before when I thought I was doing it the right way and I would look around my classroom and I would see the other students doing it differently. By the end of the class the teacher got all of us in trouble because we did it the wrong. I should have asked the teacher or kept doing how I was doing it before. I feel like some people do not have the confident in themselves. I think that is right because sometimes I over think about something that is not a big deal.

In this world we do not like to do our things. We like people choosing for us, making decisions for us, and depending on others. Some people take time to figure out their life and who they want too be in life. I think we like to depend on other people ideas and not listen to ourselves. Living in this world is always about making choices and living by those choices. Do not have to listen what other people say about what you think and how you should live your life.

A21A69767BEE,"So why do ask other people for their own opinion to help us make the better choice, well by improving your people/talking skills, That most people are usually nervous to talk infrount of others, and how we organize what got from the opinions. Let's to learning these reasons and hopeful teaching you some life skills!

What do to improved our talking/people skills, it's important to get feedback from others and you don't even know when you need it of not. Like here's an example, Generic_Name problem weather she should join the lacrosse team or not and does'nt know what to do. But she gets nervous, so she gets scared asking anyone to help her. So she goes to ask her friends and family weather or not to join. Questions like that are used in everyday life and it's always good to have a second pair of eyes to help you along the way, But it's hard when you are nervous.

How to not be nervous is hard thing to do, Because thing has the mindset were people are judging them every second. When you talk to people about something like Generic_Name she ask different friends and family on problem and still gets nervous around them. When those moments happened you take a deep breathe. Because this what want to say. The people arent going to bite you, they will answer you just like everyone else. Focus what you want to say, no one wants to be stuck in a cage of guilt, because of one questions they never asked. Now I hear that a lot and why I'm telling you this it's because I don't want to see the coward out of anything you are going to strong to go through the future, jobs, relationships, and more.

Now you to ask your friends about your question you need help decided on. When you go the ask something they feel like their opinion valves you a lot to help you with that decision, and might give you more information form other person also could build a stronger relationship. With a lot opinions weather you should join that team, it does give you different perspectives on how different people react to that problem. Others will say yes or no, and might give into details. Now that Generic_Name understands to strong and not scared, she gets her opinions and now ready to sort them out. She uses the simple pros and cons list, and able to find her answers easier then before. Now she checks the list and more votes for her to join the team, and she happy to use her life skill in the future.

Now what did we learn while reading this well, we understood what type of problem Generic_Name had and probloby relate to your problem. we learned that some are scared and nervous to talk to others and that it's important to get over with it, to not cause even more problems in the future. Lastly how can we organize the opinions and how simple it is to do. That why I think it's better to talk to other to more then one person for their opinion. So I hope next time you can remember to use those skills in the real world.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.5,3.0
A42A8E5FA4CD,"""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you someone else is the greatest accomplishment.""-By Ralph Waldo Emerson. Some people try to accomplish themselves to demonstrate that they not need someone else to be successful. Some people believe that believe in themselves is more accomplishment than believe in another people. Those people who believe in individuality became more independent. In addition for some people to be themselves is the most greatest accomplish because people learn how they can value for themselves and demonstrate that they can be something else without help of someone. Some people rather be individuality because they didn't like the opinion of others.

To begin with, People learn how they can be value for themselves. For example, ""those people who decide to marry and separate from their actual family, during time they become learning to how survive with out help of their family and they willing that they can value for themselves."" Some people demonstrate that they are independents for their actions. To be ourselves teach as how confront our mistakes and how to process them.

secondly, Be individual make people more believable in themselves. For instance, ""When people make thing for themselves they believe in them and being positively."" Some people believe that is more better be individuality because they believe in what they do that what the others' do. Some people be individuality because they are more believable for themselves. Those people who are believable in themselves are people who truly want to be successful in their life because when people are individuality they do things for their own and they realize that they are not depending for someone.

In the other hand, some people argue that is not good idea to be individual. Those people believe that be individual is a bad idea because they say that two person have more ideas than one. However, that is not true because be individual make's people to believe in themselves and also is the greatest accomplish to keep believing than what others' believe for us. Be individuality make people more believable in their selves and be positive in their own decisions.

In conclusion individuality make people be themselves and they can effort to be the greatest accomplishment. Being individuality people became to learn many things. Some people effort to do their best and not be dependent for someone. People do not need be with a partner to demonstrate that they can do many things for themselves.",3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,3.0
A53DEC5A2DE8,"Think about the benefits of working with group or alone. Well for me working with group is better. The other day i was working with a group on some geometry work in my math class. It was actually very helpful and successful. Everyone in the group was able to understand the new topic. We started talking about it and help each other understanding it. Group working is so much better than working alone.

Working in a group is great because they can help you out. And you can help them out. It is way better than working alone. They can help you understand and explain it to you more how they understand it. You can work on class assignment with your group. You can ask them to help you if you are struggling. They will try to make you understand if they can. They can tell you the wrong and help you correct it.

The second, reason why working in group is better. You are doing an class activity it's more fun if you work with a group. You can work faster and better with a group on an activity. If you are working alone on an activity and you feel it is boring. You might take a lot of time to finish because it is boring. And if you don't know what to do because you were not paying attention you group should know and tell you what you need to do.

Another reason, why working with someone's else it's better. Sometimes student don't like the teacher for some reasons and they will prefer to not ask the teacher for help. Some students rather ask their friends for help. Students may feel more comfortable asking their class mates and not the teacher. Sometimes students don't really understand the teacher very well. Just because of the way she or he teaches. Most student find that is okay and don't let the teacher know that. Because they are not very comfortable with the teacher.

Final, that was my opinion on the benefits of working with a group or working alone. For me i can work with the any group and without distracting the other people in the class. And i actually like working in group because it's fun. Working in a group it's more easy to do the class assignment and take less time. I enjoy working with friends because we can talk about other things to and get to know more people. It's always nice meeting new people and getting to know them. And if they are from different country or different culture. It is clear for me i would work with a group than working alone.",3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5
A68AABEAAB4B,"Dear diary today in the English class my friends were saying that in sum point in life the first impressions are almost impossible to change and I asked to other people and well what I think is that they should not say that because the person can be in a bad moment of there life and they arent doing good, it also can be that they don't treat everybody the same way and one person told me that they could act in a different way I thought that it's a good reason of that person and I said thank you for your answer.

My first reason is that the person can be in a bad moment of there life and they arent doing good because they just moved to another place far were they lived before and left there friends or family, someone in the family died, they feel lonely,for example I have been in this situation a lot of times and my situation is that I move a lot because of the places were my parents need to work and in some point they told me that we were going to move each year and I changed how I felt, I felt upset and not wanting to go to school anymore I only wanted to have fun; this year I havent moved but my parents are seeing what house to get 1 hour from here we may move in January and I don't feel good thinking about that because here in Generic_School I feel like in home they treat me good, the teachers help you if you need something or if you have a problem in or out of school they also tray to help you in any way, and another reason is that I made a lot of friends and I really don't want to leave them (the people here are great).

In some reasons the people don't treat everybody the same way because each persons sometimes are treated differently by the person; it hap pend to me one time and I really didn't like it; it was one time that I went to a party and I was going to meat up with a group of friends wen I got there they didn't want to talk to me I wondered why but I got to know by a girl that sow me wanting to talk to them and it was because they told them something that I didn't even know that I did; I went to talk with the girls and explain that I did int do nothing and told them that I had a twin sister and that I didn't tel them that I had a twin and that she was the opposite to me so things got fixed and we went to party all night and to have fun.

The reason that the kid gave me was that they could act in a different way because some kids are special in some part of there life; they can be aggressive or nice because they can't control there feelings sometimes or most of the time kids with a disease one of the example that he gave me is that he knew a kid and that he will help and be nice but sometimes he will be very mad and say things to the persons that he knew; he can't control his character but they were teachers that will explain what he had and they would be better and not say things about hem.

Well now that we sow all this I think that I am correct people don't always be be perfect, everybody makes errors in life or someone causes them. Thankyou for hearing me today!!

A72FE8731B45,"Ever since i started school i never liked the school lunch, i would always go the whole day without eating and I would'nt take a snack or anything so it could sustain in my stomach. Most kids at my school dont like the school lunch either, because they either think it tast wierd or just they are just picky about what they eat. Normally, when I would go almost a whole day with out eating my head would hurt or stomach and i know most teenagers in my school can relate also because they prefer to starve and not eat the food that the school serves. In my opinion. I believe that changing the schools lunch menu and making it healthier is a good idea because kids would enjoy the food, parents would not conplain about their kids not eating in schhol, and it would be a great advantage to improve the school lunch.

Most kids think that the school lunch is not very appetizing, but if the school cafeteria decides to change the school menu it would make a huge difference beacuse I know that most kids especially teenagers are very picky about their food or that it's disgusting. When I was younger I would'nt eat at school and until this day I don't because i didnt like and i would always have somach aches, and my head would hurt a lot, and i wasent able to concentrate in class. Most kids think that its not neccesary for the school cafeteria to change the menu but in reality most kids don't eat at school due the type of food they serve. Sometimes even the parents say something to their kids because they dont eat in school.

When i would go to middle school and the beginning of high school my parents would always wonder why I woud'nt eat at school, they got to a point where they thought i was depressed and i would always get yelled at because they thought something was wrong with me when in reality i just didnt like the school lunch. I understand why most kids dont like the school food because either it doesnt have flavor or it just doesnt taste the same as before, and also sometimes the food would make me feel sick from the stomach afterwards. Parents main concern is if their kids eat or not. I believe that by changing the menu it would would much better for parents to stop worrying about why their kids about why they dont like to eat at school. My parents especially my mom would barely have time to make me something, for example, she didnt have time to make me a snack or something real quick so I could have taken it to school when I was in elementary school, she would always tell me that she did'nt have time that she was always in a rush and thats why sometimes I would'nt eat. My mom almost went to put complain about the school food and that she wondered if I was the only one that would'nt eat in school.

I believe that if the school cafeteria has a advantage to change the school cafeteria food because they should think about why parents worry about their kids not eating and also parents putting complaint of why their chidfren don't eat at school. In my honest opinion i think that they should shange the menu because when I dont well or i dont eat at all it is hard for me to concentrate in class and that is a huge priority to pay attention in class and try to get good grades. If the school cafeteria plans to change the cafeteria food it would be really great because more kids will be able to concentrate. When i was in freshman an sophmore year I would always skip to go eat because I coud'nt eat the school food, i think that kids nowadays do the same thing just so they wont starve.

In my honest opinion i belive that changing the school food would be a great idea because most kids dont concentrate in class, parents worry about their kids, and also they it would make a great impact on the schhol.           ",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0
A87C80DEAB08,"People use to say that working make better life. In now days people who are self-reliance define as they need people to follow their instincts or ideas and their is also people who are usually follow their own ideas. Both of them are working ways that are preferred to people, But I think that people should seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters, Because it will make their life easier and help people who are having troubles in their life. There are a lot of thing that we cloud talk about people asking help from expert,But I got two of the story that I want to talk about and made peoples life easier.

The first example is a true story that happened to me when I was young. It was a summer in 2010, I was in a summer camp for basketball at Generic_City, It was the first practices day and I was so happy, Because I could finally start to have real training for basketball. At that time I was in a private school that have no sports, So the only way that I cloud play sport is going to camp in summer time. Well that day at middle of the practice I hurt my ankle because of my teammate so I had to stay in hospital. In hospital I thought that I will not able to play sport anymore so I was really upset about it, When I was thinking about that, My father told me that life is easy and hard some time and life will never follow the step that people go, so they have to be stronger to be able to control their own life so they will not follow the step that other people went, After my father told me that I start to realize that life ain't easy so I have to be way more stronger than before so I could be better me in future and it happened now, So that is the reason that I think with others help peoples life will be way easier than before.

The second example is a story that my mother told me when I was a child. It is a story about a young man trying to make a hammer. It was a winter in long time ago, there was a young man that live in a really old house, At one day he was trying to make a hammer so that will help him to make a new house. So he traveled a lot of place to find a perfect iron for that hammer, In the way to find perfect iron he found so many iron that's not perfect in his eyes. But in one day he found a old man that are making a hammer, when young man came close to old man he found out that is the perfect iron that his finding all day long so he asked old man how did he found the iron, After old man heard what he said he laughed and said"" young man in this world nothing is perfect if you trying to make a hammer like me you have to make everything equally, And nothing is perfect on lest you treat them perfect."" After old man told everything to young man he realized that the iron that he think is not perfect is perfect if he treated is nicely and in the end he made a normal hammer that could really help him in the future. After my mother told me this story I realized that with older help you will know a lot of things that you never knew before, And this is the second reason that I think that with experts help your life will be better and you will learn a lot of life's matter than before.

Some people often think that they will decide everything by their self, And there are some people are seek guidance from experts and authorities. But I think that people should ask form expert and authorities help, Because it will make people's life easier and help people who are having trouble in there life. There are a lot of expert that helped me a lot, And I think that it will help all the people who is having trouble in their life.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0

A93471B62AF5,"Hi, my name is Generic_Name. I heard that you are accepting people to come look at some businesses they prefer, and learn more about what they are interested in. One thing I'm interested in knowing is, How many people do you let come and experience this opportunity ? I strongly feel like it would be a pleasure to be able to come and see the environment or being able to understand the right and wrong ways of teaching kids. I think I would be great for this position because I am a well rounded person, very respectful, and responsible.

I feel like being a well rounded person is a good character trait everyone should have. I could demonstrate that in many ways. You are probably thinking, ""Generic_Name, everyone can be a well rounded person in their own ways"". Thing is, people can't compare themselves to me. I

have qualities that others may lack in, such as: speaking 2 languages, understanding kids, and being about to tolerate the kids. Speaking 2 languages is great. For example, if I have a Spanish student in my class, I'd be able to have a conversation with him and make him/her feel comfortable. Also, showing that you are interest in the job and showing that you want is good to show. You want to be able to show people that you are qualified for it.

Respect is another thing I will always have with me. I will show the kind of respect to my parents, to anyone else out there, whether is be my boss, coworkers, students, or their parents. Showing lack of respect can kick you out of your job. Being respectful will show others that you are serious about getting the job. Referring back to what I said about lack of respect, an example of that can be: coming to work and being in a grumpy mood and telling people mean things can get you to lose your job. That's why I think it's always right to be in the best attitude you could possibly be in no matter what you are going on outside of work.

The amount of responsibilities I will receive is no match for me. In other words, If you hand me 2 stacks of paper and give me 2 days to fill it out, I will. Giving me orders is another thing that i would follow, even if I don't want to do it. If I had a chance to work with kindergartners, the ones that struggle and are not comprehending what is being taught. I would stay after school with them for as long as they need until they understand and can accomplish what they didn't get in the beginning. I will always go out of my way in trying to help kids understand the material they need. Another thing is, grading homework and making sure they get it back. I feel like most teachers lack in making sure they grade their students test and not returning it on time. I would make it a priority to make sure it gets done.

In conclusion, I think I would be a great person to hire. Seeing and meeting people will improve my knowledge and how to work with others. I will get a be able things once, maybe twice, in my lifetime. This experience will make me a better person. I think I would be great for this position because I am a well rounded person, very respectful, and responsible. ",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0
AA53069FF4B4,"I believe that working in groups benefits more than someone working alone. Working in groups help you gather more knowledge, you get to learn and have fun, and you get to finish faster.

When my group comes together, we all start giving each other ideas of our own knowledge to make the project successful. Although some may know more than others, but others may know things that some dont. I also like when my group shares ideas because are project can be much more creative. Some people may believe that someone working alone can also have as much knowledge than someone working in groups. However I believe that working in groups can benefit you on having more knowledge.

Getting together with my group makes learning fun. When we start the project every one would start concentrated so that when we get close to finishing we can talk to each other. People would quietly take a break and talk so that they dont get overwhelmed. . Although, some people may believe that being groups detracts and working alone does not. However, getting detracted is something you would choose to do and not something I would choose to do.

I always felt like being in groups time would pass really fast. In a group everyone would choose what they wanna work on or work on something they know more of. When everyone is working on something it reminds me of a job, because every job wants to make the job done as soon as possible. When time flies i feel good because the job is done and i get to relax. Some people may believe that students that work alone like to take there time and do there project at there own style and make it knit. However, I am a type of guy that likes to get my job done and quick, and I believe there is a lot of people that are the same type.

In conclusion, working in groups benefits you more because of all of these reasons. Finally, I suggest that every one should try to make or find a group so that all these reasons open up to you.",4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5
AA7B4CC7EE1B,"A positive attitude is what we expect in everything and everyone whether it be from;a customer service employee,teachers speaking to sporadic students,and or a bus driver driving a bus full of disrespectful kids. The lessons they burn in your head as a kid is that a positive attitude can take you places beyond your wildest dreams and those who have a negative attitude will have a unfortunate future brought upon themselves, in all honesty through my words I don't believe a positive attitude can lead to a successful life its our decisions in the making that do decide it instead. The saying that nice guys finish last is one heck of an understatement in the least, you could be the most positive person on the planet and still have shortcomings when it comes to a successful life .

A positive attitude is just what it is, it doesn't guarantee anything sure it might be helpful when getting the things you want in life but it can only go so far in within its own limitations whether it be giving and employer a positive attitude during a job interview of a job you've always wanted while ignoring how severely under qualified you are in the field. The idea alone of someone truly believing that you can be successful with a positive attitude is a joke,if anything the person believing a positive attitude is what makes them successful isn't in on the joke they are the joke.

Similar to a positive attitude a negative is never a guarantee to a successful life at least with a negative attitude you won't see the world in rose colored glasses if anything you see it for the harsh reality it truly is rather then doing pointless things to make life just a little bit more worth your time rather then forcing a positive attitude just to take in the world easier. In my eyes its just some facade we all have the ability to put up but some choice to live in la la land while others live in the real world dealers choice really.

Our attitudes is just one thing that can change the course of our lives the real way we make it in life is how we do so with our decisions towards that successful life that everyone desires. Its a bittersweet reality on those who constantly maintain a positive attitude those kind of people are taken advantage of their kindness and will often be misunderstood with the people around them. The real way to live is to have an iron will that shows that you are not someone to be messed with but, someone who is respected and can hold their own with making heavy decisions rather then keeping it all happy go lucky.

The debate about whether or not a positive attitude or a negative attitude can make you successful in life is kinda of like those other world debates about what happens when we die, is there life other then humankind, is there really a god. Its all based on interpretations or our upbringings into this beautiful disgusting world that is life you can be born with a sliver spoon in the mouth with a negative or born in a war torn country with a positive attitude its not about how we should make a successful life with attitudes its about how we make of it.",4.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,4.5,4.5

If you meet someone and you do something weird theyre gonna remember you as that one weird kid. it can be bad when someone have a bad impression of you when your trying to be their friend. Sometime you can change people impression of you if they get to know to know you.

if your first impression isnt good it can messed up they stuff you do in life like a job interview if you dont a good impression you may not get the job. If you move to new place and your going to a new school, your going to need to have a good impression to make new friends because if your new and a lot of people dont know you and if you do something weird or dumb everyone at your new school is gonna have a bad impression of you and that may cost you to make new friends and sometimes someone may bully you for being weird. Some kids at school have bad impression and people talk about them behind their back and their made fun of them for being weird. Like if your in a sport team and your that one kid who always bragging about how good they are, people around you wont want to be around you if they know your always bragging and they will spread rumors about you and people will stop talking to you if they know you like talking about yourself and people wont want to be your friend. If you wanna ask out the girl you like and she heard you did something to a another girl, shes going to have a bad impression of you and she wont even want to talk you and your tried to ask her out shes gonna reject you.

First impressions are sometimes always hard to change if you dont try change it with the people you had a bad impressions with. Sometime they people you had a bad impression of are usually the people you want to be chill with.

AB6284069E18,"Some schools offer education at home, online, and or video conference calls. Teachers and some students believe that off campus is horrible. The reason why is : you won't have an actual human teaching you with online classes ,Video conference calls aren't great because most people aren't paying any attention to the teachers or student also you would need more assistance which is just unnecessary. Then finally you won't meet any people and you won't learn how to socialize at the end you won't learn how speak to people.

The school that offers these programs should just destroy these programs. Students should learn to how to go to school. Learn how to make friends,teachers,also day to day people. Just go get an education which is very important thing to do and that needs to happen if you want to do anything for the future the place they should just get an education is on a on campus school.

To the schools that offer the out of school education some that are at home,online,and video calls. Teachers and a lot of surveys show that having students with out of school education tend to have lower grades, more missing assignments,and less people in there lives. The facts just show that if you aren't at a on campus school,You're grades tend to be way lower then the average student on campus student. If you don't go to on campus schooling you will become social awkward. It's not fun staying home

With the online classes these days it has some benefits but the end of the day it's still a very bad distraction usual for example people love to watch television while doing work , but they aren't doing the assignment with 100 percent attention. If you want to get something done do it the right way. Also with the student they have many ways to cheat with any kind of education that's not on a on campus school cheating is 100 percent wrong not the right thing to do. Studies show that if you have two or more things that you are doing you are doing at the same time they aren't using there whole brain to do they're work. One of the major reason why online classes aren't good because you can just google the answers that's just cheating you aren't learning it's cheating.

Video Conference calls are just a waste of time. Students don't listen or even look at the screen to the call. It's just better and useful if you went to school. Just go to school you won't have to do calls and extra things like calling over and over again. Also it teaches you not to be lazy. If you go to school you wouldn't need to call or anything of the sort just go to school and get an education.

The school should destroy these programs and students need to go to an on campus school education or they won't be able to anything for the future for there education because they didn't pay attention or learn it well plus they won't have any friends to know them.

In conclusion students should be able to go to an on campus school just like the rest of us and meet new people and friends for the future.    ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0

First, Now a day many students are failing classes because most of the teacher allow to students use cell phone during they are teaching.

If students may allow to use cell phone then they can distortion by study, and their force can be in phone. When we keep use phone then we can't listen what teacher saying. For explain, last year in my histroy class we can allow to use phone so, when go to histroy class I alway usemy phone and i never listen to teacher.

I fail the class and sol because of use cell phone everyday.

School may not be allow to use cell phone in classroom because if school allow to use cell phone in classroom then students may not be able to learn anything.

If students are allow to use cell in school, then when students are doing testing they might be chage to chat on test.

Students can leave study, they gonna force on play phone.

Finally, When students have work in classroom they are so lazy to do it because they are busy to play game or use phone. In school we have lot of work to do, if teacher give us using phone then students might not do it. So, we have work then teacher sholud not give us using phone because lots of students are busy with phone or play game.

While, Many students are distorton by cell phone because they can't force on study. They think teacher give us to use phone so, we don't have to do anything and they don't do homework, classwork and study.

ABF21C9A2160,"Are we the future.? Ralph Waldo Enderson said."" To be yourself in a world that is costantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishement."" I agree with the statement of Enderson. May be some people will disagree with me. So I think is hard to be yourself in a world that is constantly changing because technology and social norms.

First the new inventes and advances in technology has brote new changes to our lives. We live in a world that is sorrounded by new advances in technogy. This has become essential and indispensable to preform our daily activities. For example the internet has become very important tool and so essential that we can't stay with out internet for even a day. We costantly surfing the social media. even if we love and hate social media we are always conected. We want to know what others think about us. With out knowing we fall in a new world call internet and we make chages just to be acepted, love even hate by othes.

Second we are part of a big sociaty. We born, grow up and died in a sociaty that has norms that we fallow. This norms sometime are written norms that are laws and if we brake this laws the sociaty can punish and we face consequences. Some norms are just unwriten norms that we fallow in our daily life. This norms can restrict our selve expretion and can stop us for doing what we want. So to fit and be aceted we fallow the social norms. For example if we go to school we must fallow thier rules to be able to get in school. We can't just walk in with a sexy litle dress and havy make up. The norms of the school are make for your to fallow the dress code. Even if you feel like the dress code restrict your personality and selve expretion. this norms are make for everyboby to mantain a the order and balance.

In conclution I must said that I agree with Enderson's quote "" to be yourself in a world that is costantly trying to make your something else is the greatest accomplishement."" therefore we emgrace new technology and follow social norms to keep the balance and maintain the order. We are part of a change together we can achieve new ideas and build a better sociaty.

ABFEE879153D,"I believe that graduating high school in three years is the best option out there, the reason why i support this statement is because, i myself i'm graduating early the reason why i decided to this was because, i felt like i was too mature for highschool and i felt like i could do more things that highscool will limit me from doing. So many students see high school as an embergo, high school literally takes four years that alot of time, we could be out there gaining expreinces from being in the workforce and actually studying what we want to do, i also feel like highschool don't really focus on what the students actually want to do, we take classes that we won't even need after high school. Ok let look at it this way, when we take history classes in highschool are kids really going to remember what was George Washington favorite food? or when did the civil war began? yes i know it can be important for us to know our history but we should'nt be taking it for four years non-stop. For example let take a look at bill gates he was a smart kid in highschool, he also use to sneak to the college libary to do his work, because he felt like high school didn't offer him the amount of knowledge he needed so he decided to drop out of high school, and has you can see his on of the top billionairs in the World. What if there is a kid like that in highschool and he/she felt like highschool is not giving him the amount of knowledge he needed and he wants to graduate early but he can't do that because, were required to take four years of everything, and it's totally not fair. When i decided to graduate early, both my counselors and teachers where discouraging me that i should'nt do it, that colleges frown at those type of stuff and all that, but they did'nt know that i already made up my mind and i felt like i was ready to take on the world all by myself without the help of my parents. In conclusion i think three years of highschool should be encouraged alot in highschool, so kids can go out there and explore and live their dreams and actually study what they want to study. And they should'nt really make students take boring courses like history for four years of high shool non stop. I'm very happy to say that i'm class of 2020!! instead of 2021, And i'm very happy that i took that road.",3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5

ACE3E472041C,"Does taking classes from home benefit students.

People might said that,taking classes from home is a bad idea, that is not useful that kids don't learn and they do nothing. In case other people will said that it benefit kids , that keep them safe and I will agree by saying that taking classes from home benefits kids.

Well I think that parents, who decided that their kids need to take classes online is for one of many reasons. for example , I will provided you three reasons why

I think kids do home classes and it does benefits them and yes they learn from it .

Parents are famous and they cant send their kids to a regular school,kids might be in danger and they can attend school because of that or it might be because they have any medical condition.

First reason why students take classes from home is probably because their parents are famous people and they know that, if they send their kid to any school, people will be chasing them,asking for pictures all the time or may be telling them bad stuff. Parents know that in that situation kids are going to be frustrated about it, sad, angry and defently they will not be able to concentrated at school. It will be hard for them to be free and enjoy school. For example on of my friends he is very famous in my country and also in here wherever he goes people is always chasing him, hi has a kid that is 6 .years old but he said that the hardest part is when the little boy goes out all of these people get to him and he gets scared. That's why he said that he decided to pay for home classes, and they prefer their kids to take classes at home. Kids will feel free and no body will be making them feel uncomfortable.

Second reason it could be because the life of any kid can be in danger and the parent of the kid and also any school will know it. They know that if any kid, that is been treated lets said by any organization, attends to school people will try to harm him or it can become a bigger problem. Because the school will defently knows that if they received that kid at school they will be putting the life of many other kids at school in risk and they will not take that change. Of course parents are not going to allow that their kids to be harm or kill. That's why the school or parents proffered to have their kid to take his/her classes from home he/she will be safe and other people too, the kid will get a really good benefit from it because he will learn and he will be safe and other people will be too.

Last reason why students get benefits from taking classes at home is probably because they have any medical condition and it's hard for them to attend any school. They will feel shame,afraid,scared and they will be thinking that everyone at school is going to make fun of He/She, that they will bully Him/Her and of course as I have said before parents will never for any reason are going to let their kids to be unhappy to feel bad to feel frustrated and feel that no body love them that's why they let their ids stay at home and take classes from it so that way they learn and no body will harm them make they feel worthless.

in conclusion,parents who made the decision to let their kids stay at home and take classes from home they make one of the biggest and hardest decisions in life. Because they know that kids will be safe nobody will hurt them, be hunting them , no body will hurt them, tell them mean stuff. They will not feel embarrassed to let people see them, Parents know that defently is not going to be the same that it will not be the same as if he was listening directly to his teacher and getting his note but they know that at least his kids are going to be safe and they will learn to they will still get benefits from it.

When you want the best for your kids and you love them more that life itself, you do what you got to do if that means to pay for his classes in other to keep them safe,and we all know that people might talk and told you that doing home classes isn't going to help you. But you know that is not true, you got to keep working working hard because sometimes students come to school, but they do nothing. What they do is get in problems fight, with other classmates or eventhey fight whith their teachers,they used drugs at school but. If you know your kid is at home working and you see that he wants to learn the don't listen to the rest of the people.",3.0,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.0
AD19BF721C0F,"Dear Principal of Generic_School:

The change of the menu at the cafeteria might be a good idea but also might be a bad idea for some students, the idea to have a new menu at the cafeteria should be made it first in a debate with all the students at the auditorium, students can have the right to vote if they would like to have a new menu at the cafeteria, they might give a vote for which kind of food can be remove and which kind of food should to stay, or they can decide if will be better to not make a change at the cafeteria, making this plan will not have any impact in students or school to choose they food or making a change because they will have the opportunity to decide what is good and what is not good for them.

Making this plan, students will feel comfortable to decide good things for their school, students can also share ideas with you and make different plans for a good change at the cafeteria, just think about it and you will see good results in students of your school.

If students decide to have a different menu of food...

""This might be a great idea for student to try different kind of food and make this change every year, the good thing about making this is that student will not feel tired for be eating the same kind of food every year.""

""Students will feel excited every day to go to the cafeteria and see the new menu of food at the cafeteria.""

""Some students might have a favorite food but they can try different varieties of food and have new favorite food.""

""Also will be a great idea to give 35 minutes of lunch instead of 25 minutes, students can share time with them friends, have more time to finish if they have any work class or homework to do.""

""Students can enjoy the free time to eat with no rush. Making a change will be an idea that all might students they'll support it."",

I hope you consider this idea as a good idea and students may consider it this as a good idea too, also think about the good change that you can make for students to have better time at school and enjoying they lunch will be great to fill they energy and get back to class.

AD53B357BD0D,"Have you ever had a really important decision you had to make? Did you feel overwhelmed because you didn't know what you should do? Asking for help or advise from people such as friends and family around you can really help alleviate all that stress. Most people encounter big decisions often throughout their lives, so getting advise from numerous people can help you get more input on something, and may end up helping you make a final decision. Seeking multiple opinions can really help someone make a better choice when dealing with decision making.

One way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that by asking more than one person, they can get more input. Asking numerous people can be a huge help when making an important decision. Not only are people getting different ideas of what they may want to do, they can also get advise from people who may be more experienced than themselves. For example, if someone was debating on which college they should apply to, they may end up asking people such as older siblings or parents for advise because they may have more experience with that matter. By asking multiple people, you can get multiple ideas, each of them being different in their own way. By getting more people's input, you may be able to start to make your own choice about the matter because of the advise you've gotten.

Another way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is by not getting any biased opinions. By asking more than one person for advise on a subject, they can get more than one new idea that isn't one of their own. This way, they can get more than one person's thoughts on the decision, and have different ideas on it. For example, if someone were trying to make a decision on what sport they may want to tryout for at school, they could possibly ask their friends and family about which they should choose. However, they should also ask people like classmates and teachers, as they may have their own ideas, and won't give the person any biased ideas or information. Friends and family can have a great deal of influence on people, so it's important to always get people's thoughts that are on the outside. This will make it to where there's a greater chance of the decision maker not being biased, as they've heard numerous people's thoughts, and can make their own decision off of that.

A final way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is by being more prepared about the choice they're going to make. The decision maker can use all the advise they've gotten from different people to make their own choice, and feel better prepared. They will be more focused as they know what they want to do, and will feel more confident and less overwhelmed. Feeling less overwhelmed can be a big help as the person doesn't have to be so worried, so they won't have any distractions from making the best possible decision. For example, if someone is trying to decide what kind of car they want to get, and they've gotten advise from numerous people, they can make a better choice when picking. They'll know exactly what they want, as they've heard many thoughts from the people around them, and so they can make their final decision.

After getting advise from multiple people around them, the decision maker may be able to make the best choice possible, as they've gotten new thoughts and ideas. Asking for help or for some advise from those around you can help you make the best possible choice because you've gotten a lot of new information and opinions that you wouldn't have gotten if you had only asked one or no one at all for advise. Making an important choice can seem a little bit easier and less stressful after seeking advise from multiple people. Getting help from others around you can help you make the best choice you can.

Like when you aim low like only work in fastfood and only get paid minimum wage forever, then get a job for a company like samsung of nintendo and get paid more then that.

1 of the examples is the debt/taxes you want to live a good life when you're down here right so do you want to live with so little money or more money that you save from a good job.

My 2nd example of this is like athletes if you learn what you did right, or wrong to achive that goal you have to push yourself further then what you are right now.

ADDFE045FED1,"Although, I believe sometimes being around many different influences, such as religions, trends, and different cultures. We all choose our own traits.

Certainly, many different things can influence us. Such as trends, for a couple of weeks, months or years. Many different things could be could be trending. Like different genres of, movies, music, or video games, even clothing. In the moment when those things are popular it might feel amazing to own those particular things. Many people who cant afford things of such nature such as the latest cars, jewelry, and brands like Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Moncler, or anything of type nature that is trending. People like teens or young adults might feel terrible because their friends could be having those things and they cant afford it, and when they get some money they might go and spend it on expensive things to fit in. But as you get older, and the trend is over, most people regret spending a lot of money on things they didnt need. After the trends die out and everybody moves on to the next set of trends. People will start maturing and decide to wear, listen to, and do their own things, instead of being just like everybody else.

Most people, if not everyone would prefer doing things they like rather than doing things they dont like because their friends want to do it. A majority of people in the world have made themselves who they wanted to be. Every persons interests can influence them more than any person or friend. If it wasnt for peoples interests, and wanting to be themselves whether they were accepted or not. Most famous people wouldnt be where they are today. A lot of people use their interests to get them out of bad situations, which brings me to my final paragraph.

Following your dreams and being true to yourself can take you a long way. Although when people think of chasing their dreams, they picture being rich, famous, and living in a mansion. Others may think of starting a business with things they have a passion for and enjoy. Even having a daily basis of clients/ customers, even if its 5-10 people a day. At some point if that person stays consistent and humble, something big may happen for them and their business can just become huge, and they could keep on growing and having people who also share the same interests could come in on a regular basis. I believe everybody chooses who we want to be at some point, it may take time but in the end, everybody finds themselves.",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5

AF8963C142A0,"Benefits on working with a group is a better way to get work done because most students get to use different ideas,Helping each other out with different parts on projects finishing work faster,and communicating with each other is key if working in groups.

However not everyone would agree with this position, because it benefits of working alone is most students don't have to wait on others to do their work. For example The teacher assignes a project and they have to be in groups of five and two of the students do their work and the other three don't do their work. It brings everyone else down.

Working alone makes students not have to worry about others not doing their part of the work.

Most students get to use different ideas when they work on groups. For example students get together to start talking about how they are going work together and start giving differents ideas on how to work better as a group

Working in a group makes students jobs less complicated and stressful by having others helping each other

Working in groups students get to help each other out. For example each student gets to be in charge of one part of the assignment so everyone contributes and work gets done faster. Helping each other out is really important to the group and communication is key when students work in groups.

Communication with each student in the group is really important if students working in groups want to get work done. For example each member of the group comminicates with each other and work gets done faster. Communication helps in different ways,helping someone if they don't understand something,Giving advice to another student if they feel like they are stuck or need a different opinnion or not agreeing with someone else there's always a different way to communicate that to each other. communication is key to work in groups.

Working in groups benefits one another by working faster, communicating with each other, helping each other out when someone is not understanding something and giving different ideas. Working in groups can be helpfull if students know how to use it and take advantage of the opportunnity. It should be the best way to get work done and be able to help each other out.

Technology allow poeple to complete many task without having contact with others. Technology have a negative effect in people life because people life is passing in front of their face without knowing, technology hurts people in many ways,and make many people to feel bad with themself.

Some people think that technology is the best creation that the human ever made because entertain and hepl people to understand many things. Others believe that technology is a easy way to make assigments because google have every kind of information. Still other argue that without technology this world would not be the same because doctors would never find the tratment for the sickness.

Technology have a negative effect in people life because they forget to live their life and the time is passing, just because they spend all their time playing video games, in the phone, and they star to getting older and because the years are passing like nothing and really fast that when they react they would see that their best years just passing, without enjoy their time with the people that they love. Many people just react only when one family member death and they start to think that life is too short, and it is why people need to apreciate and enjoy,

learn new thing, meet new places, have more experiences, and also meet new people and learn good thing from them.

Many people hurt them self in many ways for example physical and mental because physical they star to get fat and then they do not take care about their healty and if they do not take care who else would do for them, because when they star to get sick they just do not care about it, because they want to keep concentrate in their video games or telephone. metal many people just not care about their future and goals, because they are really busy thinking how to get the most advance technology device and who is usining in where they go. many people do not take care about their personal life and after few years later when the affected would be them because they did not care about their future they would have nothing and the technnology every year change, and get new devices. People need to think about what is most important something else that is really important and needed or a device that in few months would be betters phone and other devices, because for example whe a phone just come out every one want to buy and the price is more than $1000 and after few monts the price is more lower and they have another new phone, it is in what people want to spend money and time, first think and later act after they know is the best.

Technology makes people to feel bad about themselves because now people believe everything that is posted in internet, only because some people said it ect. Other make their self look better in the phone and when they look their self in the mirror they hate their self, and sometimes people look other people in internet that they post picture they want to be like them and they star to despreviate their self and start to search in google how to change or do something they can not do it or does not work they get depress, stressful and tired of their life that sime search the easy way, that many people and doing in other country that is kill their self, so technology just affect people in many ways.

Technology affect people in a negative way because people spend too much time on techonology and life is just passing. Technology is taking over people, and into they get hurt with something or someone that they love they start to see that they was doing wrong, they get dissapoinment with themselves for being so stuped, people need to use less phone and spend more time with family and enjoy every second of life because life is just one and is really short.

Writting SOL Grade 8

Before, I would always like to try and play the guitar. My brother would always try and teach me, Everytime I hear the guitar, it makes me feel calmed. Also when I was in Elementary School, I used to live in Generic_City, VA. The school I used to go to was named Generic_School. In Generic_School I used to be in band, so I would play the flute. I always tried to play the flute. I would never give up in something that I like or something the was my passion. Though, later on in middle school, when I went to 6th grade, I got in chorus. Once I got in chorus I thought I would hate that class of chorus, but later on I noticed I cannot stop singing. I always like to sing along with music or people. I am glad that I got in chorus in 6th cause I found out myself what I like to do, and what I like to do is sing. Even though, what I still would like to do is learn how to play the guitar and the flute. Doubt I can learn, but I can always try to play hem or one of them.

Another, thing I like to do is workout/exercise. Doing workout/exercise relaxes me a lot and makes me forget about a lot of family problems. I used to be in boot camp. I was in bootcamp when i was in 7th grade then I in 8th but I had to quit for a very obvious and hurtful reason. That reason is that my keee cap is out of place. I was suppost to get surgery, but my mom dosen't have that type of money to pay the surgery. Now, all i do is take pills that my doctor is recommending me but i think they are making me worst but I take them cause I have too. Sometimes, they make my pain go away or they make my pain feel worst to the point where i fall in the floor. I don't really know what they are doing to me. Although I hope I get better by 9th grade cause I want to join the junior army that is at Generic_School. I always wished to a nurse or going to the army, thought sometimes I feel like if I go to the army I would get hurt real bad in there. Even if I worked as a nurse in a hospital, I don't think I would fit right in. I feel like i can disgusted easily but I still want to help people, but I doubt 'll fit right in. I don't think i'll have a great future. I can always try to get what i want all i gotta do is work hard, and ill be able to accomplish the future I want and i've been thinking of, i just gotta do the right thingand also at the right moment.

Hopefully one day everything I want to accomplish now that I can't do i hope I accomplish it in the future and i hope it turns out good too. The wishes i have of playing the guitar,flute, my knee cap getting better, joining the junior army, get in the actual army or just being a nurse I hope I can do all those in the future. I want a great big beautiful and wonderful future. I want to make my family be proud of me for once in forever. When all those have I accomplish by the future im going to look at the ones who would bully me or say things about me and just say what happened to you? I know for a fact if to accomplish those goals in the future they will become true. Some day ill be looking down at people who put me down even when I in a good place.

In the future i also want to play soccer or basketball in 6th and in 7th i sould love to play basketball. I woukld always go outside and go to a basketball court and takemy basket ball sometimes with some friends to play with or sometimes it used to be with my step dad. I have never tried playing soccer cause playing soccer looks hard to do but some say playing soccer isvery easy, thought it dosen't look like it. I have played with my brother before but i'm always scared that my brother is going to kick the ball too hard and accidentaly hit me. Hoping this summer i go to the store andbuy meself a soccer ball and a basket ball for the summer to go out and play. Maybe with my brother to play soccer or even to play basketball but i doubt so i don't even know. I'm not very good atr basket ball, but i sure can throw good in the hoops.

Also always wanted to be a professional coach in basketball but for that I need a lot of practice and me trying hard but I also want to focus in school. Though what i really suck in school is Math, Civics and Science and I don't know how to get better in those three claases i try too but I always fail and always get and F or a D. I don't know really how to bring my grades up in those three classes. Yet i still look fordward a amazing future that i probably cannot have. Even thought what I said, I always got to try on something that i want or else i cannot get it. That's why I always got to try on it. Hopefully bringing my grade up can help me on something cause i really need to bring up my grades i've been getting close too in other classes lately but in those three I can't. In the future I will just not now cause I can't jus try i can't say yes i can knowing i cannot at all. I wish i can ask for help but I am always scared to ask teachers in frony of everyone else so I leave teachers notes witch is ver y emberrassing but at least im trying to bring up my grade. I'm just trying to make my family proud for once in a while. I will not only make them proud cause i'll also make myself proud, and look up and thank god for helping and thank my dad that is in heaven that is right now watching me hopefully.

I have so many wishes and dreams in the future that I am looking fordward too, but i don't even know if i'll be abke to accomplish it and make it.

All im looking fordward too is to accomplish everything and make people happy and proud of me and im trying to be proud of myself and feel like myself for once in a while. All i gotta say is that, no one should give up on their dreams or on what they want to do cause i know everyone can do it and they accomplish there dreams, you can always make everythinmg right you just need the riht moment and need for us to be strong and do it. Never give up on big dreams like these. Everyone should try to make the best out of you.",3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0

B110268BBFEC,"Albert Schweitzer the philosopher,physician, and humanitarian is great at motivating people by saying, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing. What he means from that is everyone behavior is different. When it comes to behavior anybody could act different. behavior influences some people. when it comes to influence it often affects a person or events. Albert Schweitzer is a very successful man and he probably accomplished that by having influence in him self and believing on what he is capable of. Say one day i was having a rough day and somebody asks me, ""hey, do you want to know something"" or if they are being very annoying your attitude and behavior is going to change into something bad. Yes behavior could change somebody attitude and that's not good and that's what he's trying to say. Albert Schweitzer is setting good examples for people who struggle and people who really needed to hear his example.

Everything that Albert said in that quote is very true. Always setting good examples are a good and great way to influence somebody in many ways as what he just told us in his quote. Albert Schweitzer probably learned in the past and maybe thats what he's trying to tell us to watch our future that is ahead of of us in time.                           ",2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5
B1AFACE6704E,"I agree with Michelangelo's statement as I have found through experience that it benefits me more to set high expectations and not reach my goal, rather than settling on a low goal and achieving it. When setting high goals, I find that I learn more and progress my abilties further than I do with a lower goal. This is because setting high goals requires confidence, challenges, and pride.

Firstly, hard work is required to achieve high goals, and requires confidence. Confidence involves having trust and believing that you are capable of accomplishing something. I have found that when I set high goals, I feel more confident in my abilities. With lower goals however, my confidence is lower as I settle for the easier path and do not trust myself to do better. With a higher aim, my confidence motivates me to not give up. I tend to try harder, and always believe in myself. For example, at school, I had to choose whether I wanted to try out for the varsity tennis team or remain in the club team. The varsity team was a higher reach, and required confidence in my abilities for me to try out. The club team was a lower reach, as I knew that I could simply continue with it. I decided to try out for the varsity team, and was confident in my abilities. I practiced hard and did not give up. Despite not making it onto the team, I found that I actually greatly improved my abilities through the confidence I had gained, and tried harder than I had ever before. I managed to progress my skills, and was able to play more confidently on the club team and excel. Therefore, setting high aims requires confidence, which is a very beneficial characteristic to have in life.

Secondly, setting a high goal indicates a challenge. It will be more challenging to attempt to aim high rather than aiming low, yet this will also prove more benefits. With a challenge, I tend to be more motivated as I want to prove my capabilites. I try harder, and in return get further. Even if I fall short of my high aim, I tend to get further than I would have if I had settled with a lower aim. With lower goals, there is no challenge, and so once the aim is achieved any effort stops. Learning is limited to that low expectation, and will not be able to go beyond. For example, in my high school career, I have always struggled with picking between two types of courses: honors or academic. Honors is the more challenging course, which requires more work and effort and would pose as more of a challenge. Academic however, requires the bare minimum and is easy to succeed in. In the honors course, I would be setting my aim high yet might not get the grade I want; yet, in the academic course, my aim would be low and I would most likely get the grade I want. After hard consideration, I decided to opt for the honors course. This course may be a challenge, yet would allow me to learn more. I enjoyed the challenge, and found that it motivated me to try harder to try and accomplish my goal. Even if I fell short of my ideal grade, I was proud to have tried my best and felt that I learnt so much more. The course benefited me more than the academic course would have, despite not receiving the grade I hoped for. Therefore, challenging oneself with a high aim allows for more flourishing and encourages more learning. Overall, setting a high aim will pose more benefits.

Thirdly, pride accompanies setting high goals. When setting low aims, I feel that it is easy to achieve the goal. However, with high aims, it is more challenging to achieve the goal, and so I feel proud of myself for attempting it. Pride is a very important characteristic, as it increases self esteem. With a higher self-esteem, I tend to try harder and feel more powerful with my abilities. I am more likely to learn and improve upon my abilities, which overall allows me to succeed. For example, in high school I had the opportunity to write a poem and submit it into a writing competition. This was a high aim, as the goal was to win. I felt very proud of myself for taking the time to write and challenge myself with this competition, and ended up writing my favorite piece yet. I submitted my writing, and did not win. However, I felt very proud of myself for having tried so hard and was able to learn and flourish in my writing abilities. Now, I am more likely to sign up for competitions, even if I do not win, simply because I enjoy the challenge and feel that I am able to learn. I feel proud of myself for taking on these challenges. Therefore, setting high goals emmits pride, which can prove very beneficial in life.

In conclusion, I agree with Michelangelo's statement. Setting high aims and falling short can bring so many more positive effects than setting low aims and accomplishing them. This is because setting high aims requires confidence, challenges, and pride. These characteristics are very important in succeeding, and can encourage learning and progression in abilities. Through setting low goals, learning becomes stagnant. In order to flourish and continue learning, setting high goals is crucial, even when not achieving the goal. ",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

B2919590BDB0,"I do agree with Prime Minister Winston Churchill. My first reason is because most of the people in this world will think that is really easy to be successful, but time will get difficult as you and your self are growing up, for you to be failing over and over again is just a meaning that life at some point will be easier, Most people if they keep failing they won't know what to do, Keeping your hope and thoughts on your mind that's how you will succeed. keep on following that dream no matter how hard time will. Sometime you will feel like you're not getiing answer or at least a signal.

My second reason is that failure is going to come at some point in your life for example; teenager come at school, adult come at work, money wise, housing. failure is something that we all should learn how to over come that problem we should think for a solution make a plan in our life. how are we goinf to fix this part and find a solution to over come that problem if we need help from somebody.

My third reason is that as soon as you over come failure you start learning thing about themselve, that they didn't know before, most people find ways to stop going back failing, that's when you start gaining the believe on keep going on practicing every single method to do not fail again.

In my conclusion most of the people have those hard time and is bext to talk to someone about a look for answer, in way to find the solution and fix this problem by yourself or with someone important in your life.",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5
B3145EA3395B,"To see someone impression, that might be possible to chang. Because the majority of people might be mad when from somthing when we see them from the first time, I disagree with this statement because most people chang there impressions when they're in a spicific mood, Some might change after a proplem has been solved. Because when I was yonger from now my dad allways use too tell me

""too mach agreement kills a chat"". Many peple chang thier imperssions after the first time we see them.

So I have a frined who allways chang her mood by any time, some times she would come to my house and knock on the door even if we were just argued about something, but when I saw her the first time when we met she was very nice and my parent invited her to my house and her first time her impression was very happy and intersted to see us and learen about our culture, so when I saw her the next day we were so happy that we met. and I told her my trip how we came to the US, she was so impress to know more about us, But some time she woluld change becaus of her parents and when she's sad she comes to my house and tell me how she has been and how her family is with her, and I was listen to her as she tells me every thing, But when some one come to our house and see's her like that they say that she's wired from how she acts, but her first imression was't like that, she changes with what impact throw her life, and we're a teens also, Every day my parents sees her they say that she's very talented because she has a very good voice and I use to be so happy to see her singing because she had a good voice, but her impreesion changed after I saw her how she reacts with others, and I use to get surprised of how she's diffeent with methen others, but now I found that people are like a door each person need a spacial key to open them and understand how they feel and think. To see people's impression, I have to look at them when they are in thier good time that will chang the ideas. and to affect especially forcibly or deeply to some one's mind when they see some one impressions for the first time.

I encorage everyone to change thier opinion about the first impression are almost impossible to change. Because the majority of people impression can chang etheir over time or by the area sourounding them, and figer out how make time to understand how it goes and how people thier features from influence by the socity around us and how I said can give the impress with your senserity follow people's impressions, and literally the word impression is the sence of feeling in how someones feeling from sirten situation.

Seeing the reality, Most humans have their way of reactions to react to every thing they can show or chang by somehow in their life, In this period of time no one like to listen to someone's story, Real people who shows their impressions by the area sourounding them it effects us as who we are and the time that we are in, So the place that we are often been can effect our impressions, The place that we been raised in can impact on our impression. People's reactions might chang after an accident happen to some one's in the past It can be a very big and huge chang for some one's reactions if we see them the next time or day. Places and moumints can be on of the reasons why people impressions are mostly can change by this way, This kind of things might be wired to be impossible. Emotions and there behavioral changes in some bodeis deppend on how they think by a word or emotinal apperance can be changed with their behavioras, and some might be in need so bad for somthing and that can also shows their impressions behavioral chang.

When I was in my country many people came to the area where we live there was so many that your mind can't relate to what we see and we all were very nice to them and we gave them many of the things that we have and as much we can, There was so many kids from them I use to be realy sad when I see them like that I refused to give every thing I can to them but some of them was vrery hungry and some are mean but I said to my self in my mind that their impreesion won't be like that if they weren't in need like that.

You would want to go to the Bahamas because the beach is crystal clear. You can see all the baby fish that are swimming around you which is so cool! I always try to catch one but it never works. There will also be very colorful snails stuck on the rocks. They look poisonous so I never try to touch them. You can also go surfing there. I am too scared to surf so I just lay down on the surf board and relax. There are coconut trees near the beach which looks really cool. One of my favorite parts is when big boats pass by and big waves come your way.

Another reason why you would want to go to the Bahamas is because the restraints there are like no other restraints here. The restraints there look big and fancy. The best part is that you get to eat at a restraint for every meal because there is no store there for you to buy food and cook it up. Although that may be a little expensive, but you have to keep in mind that you are on vacation. It takes about ten to fifteen minutes for them to serve your food. I don't know about you, but to me that is not long at all. The food taste so good! They also never over cook your food too! One of my favorite dishes is the shrimp pasta. If you go to the bathroom it is super clean and it smells good too. I hate it when I go in a bathroom that is dirty and smells bad.

Another reason why you would want to go to the Bahamas is because of the awesome, clean, and fancy hotels there. The hotels there are nice and refreshing. It is super clean. There are two closets, two beds, and one bathroom which is pretty good if you ask me. There is also a big TV right in front of the two beds. There is also free WiFi for you to use but that is kinda unless when you have a big TV right in front of you unless if you want to play games on your phone which is what I do. There is also a mini fridge for you to put your water so when your hot just grab the icy cold water out of the fridge to drink. The best part is that there is air conditioning and it actually works.

B403A4E28BCE,"Why do we need to seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters? Why can't we make our own decisions? It's because the adults knows what's best for their kids and they been through everything that we are experiencing right now as a teenagers. Or is it because they would like to keep us safe and make good life choices in the future? But, I think we should make our own decisions because we know what's best for us, we can learn from our mistake, and we want to be more independent.

First, when we do something bad and get in trouble for it, we know not to do it next time. For example, I had a friend and she decided to go to a party and I told her not to go because it's always a fight. Well she went and ended up getting hit in her face. I tried and warned her but she make her own decisions and I wanted her to make her own decisions so I let her go. Now she doesn't go to parties anymore.

Then, we know what's best for us. If we know something we're doing is wrong but everybody is doing it too, then we will do it just so they wouldn't make fun of us or we want to be ""cool"". But, I only do it one time, while other people keep on doing it. For example, when we choose the wrong groups of friends to hang out with. Knowing they are bad but sometimes they bring out the other side of you that nobody have seen or they get you in trouble just so you can fit into the group. Then you wonder why you even became friends with them in the first place.

Last, we don't listen our parents or any adults telling us what's right and what's wrong. we would want to figure things out by ourselves and be more independent.

We know when they telling us that we shouldn't do certain stuff because they did it before when they were younger. But we know what we're doing ( well at least some of us know). Sometime we don't tell our parents what's going on at school or on social media but somehow they find out whats going on with us. We sometimes try to hide the problem and solve it our selves but it doesn't go well.

In conclusion, teenagers today will want to do everything and not listening to the adults. When we get older and start to understand why we did all those crazy and nonsense stuff in high school or middle school, like fighting (knowing it's not going to solve the problem), making fun of other people (knowing that's not how we would like to be treated), and smoking (knowing it's bad for our lungs). We just wanted to be like everybody else"". But,

at the end of the day we learn from our mistake and become a better person in life. ",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0
B41ED2C0C016,"One place in the world I would like to visit is Generic_City,Peru. The reason I want to visit Peru is because my grandma and my dad live there, I haven't seen them in 7 years and I want to see them at least one more time until I grow up. Once I arrive I want to spend some time with my grandma and my dad to catch up what has happened over the years. I also want to go to the beach and the pool and go to the park with my whole family and have an awesome picnic and we would make smores and tell creepy stories, also I would want to get a tan,but one of the things i haven't done ever in my life is skydiving I know it would be really scary but it would also be really fun to see their reaction when the jump out of a plane it would be really funny to watch it over and over again. The last place I would visit is machu picchu because it is such a clam place. At night you see the stars and in the morning u see the sunset rising. I would never want to leave .To sum up i would have an amazing time with my family.

Because I would visit Peru I would see my cousins,brothers,grandma,aunts,uncle and my dad I would see them everyday and we would spend some family time together.

When I go to the beach we are going to have a picnic we are going to go swim also we are going to play some games we are going to have a blast !

I am going to visit machu picchu. The first thing i would do is watch the sunset, ride camels,ride horses and take awesome pictures.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5
B50C9D328FAD,"If you could visit one place in the world where would it be? One place that I would like to visit is Pakistan. Here are some reasons why I would like to visit this place. First, it is known for it's parks. Secondly, the food is amazing. Lastly, Pakistan is one of the nicest culture. As you can see, Pakistan is an excellent place to visit.

Pakistan is known for some of it's best amusement parks. One place I would go to is Aladdin park. It's an amusement park with a lot of thrilling rides. I could go on the chair lifts. They are so awesome. Another place I would go to is Sea view. It's a beach. There I could go on horse and camel rides. The rides are exhilarating. About three or four people can ride the camel at the same time. They take you all the way to the water than back to where you started. Another place I would go to is Safari Park. It is an amusement park /zoo. There is a section for animals. You can go on a safari ride to see them. One of the best part about the ride is that you get to go to the elephants cage. There you can pet the elephant, you can even feed it, and you can go inside the cage if you want to go close to it. As you can see, Pakistan has variety of places to go so you won't get bored.

Food. It's the most important thing..right? When I wake in the morning after an awesome night. I will be hungry. So I start my day first by going to the local breakfast shop. There I will order eggs with some round hot parathas, and than some hot piping chai. Then when it's lunch time I will go to a fast food restaurant. There I will order a chicken burger with yummy fires and soda. When night comes around it will be time for dinner. For dinner I will go to a local restaurant. There I will order steaming hot Chicken Korma with buttery naan and Mango lassi. For desert I will have hot gulabgamun. They are like little doughnut balls covered with sugar syrup, and are very soft. As you can see, Pakistani cuisine is very delicious.

The people are very nice in

Pakistan. Wherever you go you would see people helping out each other. They are very welcoming and kind. They treat each other like they all are equal. They laugh, talk, and they just have fun. They don't disrespect each other, they take care of each other, and are very grateful. They are very protective towards each other. They're like a community and support one another. As you can see, Pakistani culture/people are the best.

In conclusion, I would say that Pakistan is awesome. So get your plane ticket right now and come to Pakistan. It is one of the best country you could visit.",4.5,5.0,4.5,5.0,4.5,5.0
B5FFED1536FE,"I disagree with Emerson because if they have already mastered, and they still want to try something new, it's good for them, and they will grow up by the time they figures out what they want to know more.

While you already mastered, it doesn't means you known everything in life. Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something..."" You should doing something more than what you have known. For example, ""You want to study more languages than other people and they keep telling you not to do it."" The reason they say it because they think if you good in one thing, you should only focus on that things and try to do as good as you can, but if you are a person who are interesting in many thing, you shouldn't listen to them. Keep follow what you are interesting and try to do it. If you want to know more than a languages or want to try to do something not your domain and you have no skill in that things, you should try to learn what you're interest, and try to talk to a person who is speak a language you are interesting, and asking a person who have known about the domain you are interesting, and try to do your best in that thing. If you're a person know one thing and only focus on that thing, sometimes it good because you are so good in that thing and you can help other people what you good, but it also not good because you don't know anything except your master degree. When you're interesting in many things, people can't despise you. If you try to do the domain it's not your skill just try as much as you can to study that, then ask for help to somebody good in that domain.

Eventhough if you are a person who don't have any interest in other thing, you're still good but keep in mind if you want to do something not in your master degree, it will be challenge you because you are not know anything about that domain. However, try something new beyond your mastered will help you, and it's good while you are a person have a lot of dream and you're keep follow your dream and don't listen you other people against what you are interest.

B744CD534ADB,"Dears, teachers of Generic_School.

First, I think that we all should work alone, because each student can be working for their self with out any other help from students that do not care about their projects or homework, all students has different ideas, working in a group would be more stressed for the student, they may not have the opportunity to show their own ideas working in a group. However, working in a group sometimes can be helpful but working alone can be more helpful to the teacher, working alone, the teacher would see who deserved a good grade, working in a group one of the persons can be the only one who does all the work. In addition, working alone can be the best way to show our own ideas because everyone has different opinion about the projects or the homework and how is going to be, working alone should be more helpful for the student who had different opinion in their topic.

In my English class we all were working in groups, well in my group were three people one of the group was at their phone seen social media, and doing nothing, I ask if he needs help and if that was the reason why you are not helping us to do our project, I said, he just answer and said don't ask me, that's not your problem, he was unreasonable but there wasn't nothing more that I can do for someone who do not want to work, that's one of the a lots of reasons why is not helpful working with a group.

Wherever, I believe that working alone is the best way to show up our mind and be sure that we can do all that we want to do, some people think that working in a group they can get done more fast any projects but I think that we should work alone because there is some people that do not care about their subjects and sometimes the teachers think that they just do not want to do nothing but there are people that we really want a good grade, working alone let the student to focus more in their own work than someone who is stressed about if his partner is going to help or not. Some people said that working in a group it's more fun than working alone but I think that working alone some times can be also fun because you make your own rules and use your own imagination.

In conclusion, students should work alone, each students can be working by their self and with out thinking if their classmate is going to help in any kind of project, all students has different ideas, working in group would be more stressed for the student, working alone can be more helpful to the teacher, the teacher would see who deserved a good grade. Working alone is the best choice, teachers considerate students ideas like the most big new option to improve our society, working alone is the best way to show our own ideas, by working alone students will be feel more confident about their work and more likely to explain their work.

B7626C8D1FAB,"Students should start picking a career when they entered high school, so they can pick classes in school or ask teachers to help you with your career.

If students start picking a career at a young age they will already have an idea of what to do, they can do research about their career at school. how much do people with your career make, what does this career do, how much do they make a year. You can even ask your parents to help you with your career by giving you some advice to help you out. The libary is a great place as well you can find books that match up with your career ask they libarians to help you find the right book. If you have an older siblings that have already gradated high school and have their career they can talk to you and help you out and to tell you what to do.

School counsulers are great people to talk when your looking for a career. You can ask your counsuler any questions to help you set up a plan after you graduate high school, talk about why you choosed this career for you, do you have some experiences with this career yet, what do your parents think about this career that you want to have. Counsulers can help you look for colleges or universities that you wan to attened. You can also have your counsuler set up a meeting with you and your parents to talk and see what they can do for you.

If you know anybody who has the same career that you want to have. Have a talk with them and ask he or she questions about what do you do in your job, how much does your job pay you, how much do you make a year, if they can take you where they work at and see the other employees there and have conversations with them. Its good to talk people who has the same career that you are studying for because. They have worked hard to get where they are today and they have jobs that they enjoy doing making money and living their best life.

You should start looking for colleges when you are in your junior year of high school because. When you are looking for colleges you have to check how much you have to pay to attend the college, how much do you have to pay a month. That's why some teenagers start working while they are in high school, so they can start saving money for college. Some parents pay the college for their kids, but i think its better if you pay some of that money with your parents, so they don't have to waste all of their money for you to go college. Some jobs will help you pay for the college that you will be attending at.

As we read this is why i think students should start pickcing their future careers while they are in high school because. So they will have a plan ready after they graduate high school, go to college, graduate from college, and start looking for jobs of the career that you choosed. Help other students who want to have your career as well. You can talk them to help them out, answer all the questions they have to ask you, tell them what to do you are looking for colleges to help with their career, show them where you work and show how your job is.

B83897288B43,"As human beings, our character traits are important in our lives, because they are what determine who we are, and how we are going to develop with the people around us. But those traits, do we really aquire them ? Or they are formed by little and dieferent pieces of things that trough the our lives they influeced us ? In this essay I will argue my point of view and why do I think.

Our parents, they were our firts teachers, and also the firts influence on us. I'm lucky for having really good parents, but not just becuse how they treated me, but also for what they teached me; being respectful, responsible, having manners, the good things. Those are traits that not everybody have, but the ones who do, it's because they acquired that influence from somebdy. When we are growing some other factors influed on us, I remember that in my firts group of friends everything we did was play with those Hotwheels cars and everything I wanted during my five trough nine years old were Hotwheels cars, it was in my personality the fact that I liked them, but if it wasn't for those ads on TV, those external influnces I wouldn't realize that I liked them, same with LEGOS when I was twelve, and videogames nowdays, and during that time and even now, those friendships became another influence on our lives, we play or talk about same things and when we are doing that they become a influence for me on the same way I become a influence for them.

We share and receive those little traits for outside and we forge them into a unique trait by mixing them with ours, making it part of our personality. Someone who says the opposite may have their point, because in this world there is a lot of people who came from the worst places, when you could see the worst influences for then. becoming an admiable and respetable person, but then were you listen their story, it was something, even a little influence, but for them was bigger than any other, even the ones that were in front of that people, so they wanted to reach it and they did it. People is really suseptible, specially kids, so lets try to keep those bad influnces on them, because as the same way a great person can come from a bad place, a bad person can also come from a rich place just because they were under some bad influence, teach them good things so they can avoid the bad ones.

B8EE6B6594BD,"Most students enjoy summer vacations,but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and the students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. Some people argue that there should be year rounds schools,where there would be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring fall.

This is the opinion of some educators that think the students dont need a long vacations ,because they cannot retain the learned in the past year, some students think the same .The system to the long long vacation for students in high school can be a very problematic because they are start the adultlife and need time off for live.

The idea that the students's vacations need are more short is bad because the students in high school needs long period of vacation for find their firts job, some students need travel to other country for visit their family and need a long vacations; if the students not have a good long vacations they can stressed and have other nervous problems.

For this situation to improve that the vacation are very short is impossible because not all students have a same system to live and some need time to find independitzation, some enjoy with their family and other can study in their homes, in other words the students need explore the world and this only can possible when have time in vacations the rest of the year they can study.

Educators and other people that think the system of short vacations need understand that before they was a students and they also was need vacation for forget all thing and enjoy the life.

The other side for take postion in this issue is that the short bacations are goof for not forget the learned in old classes.

Some people think that the student need a long periods of vacation specifically in summer , but this is bad because the student only need study and the student cannot retain the information for long time and they need more time in the school for learn more thing and repeat the learned in past years.",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0
BA71C09852E8,"Generic_Name is a student that just finished middle school and is getting prepared to start high school. He is really excited to find a career throughout high school and knowing which one would suit him best. Unfortunately after he told his parents, they were not amused with his response. Generic_Name was sad that his parents didn't encourage him and wasn't as excited to find a career as he was before. Although some people think that it is ridiculous for students to identify a career at a young age, they are wrong. Students with benefit in knowing to identify a career because this will improve their knowledge, learn new skills, and teaches them how to make their own decisions.

Students will be able to improve their knowledge whenever starting high school because this will get students to be prepared for any task at any time. Students are also going to be noticing that there are more opportunities throughout the school and have the option to choose what suits them best. Students can be able to notice that high school many students really improve from freshman year to senior year and can compare how much they really care about the students education. For example, Generic_Name is a sophomore and is looking at a career to become an English teacher, but he hasn't really improved as much in his English class. He talked to his English teacher about it and wanted to get tutored and really know how to become a teacher. In less than two months, Generic_Name has improved so much in English and is finally understanding what to do and feeling confident that in the future he will become a teacher. Students will also benefit at finding a specific career if they learn new skills.

Students will be able to learn so much throughout high school and especially learn new skills. Many students whenever they start high school they can learn new skills, for example: playing an instrument, playing a sport, or even learning how to cook. Students will also learn new basic skills, weather its Math, Science, or History. Students can also learn new skills if they could join a club or activities throughout the school. Students will have the opportunity to learn all of these skills and could really help them out to find a specific career. For example, Generic_Name is a senior and wants to find a career about becoming a guitarist, but his teachers were concern due to how magnificent he is with Technology and Science. Generic_Name wasn't really interested in those careers and has told his teachers that he wants to play for the world. The teachers we're upset with Generic_Name but understood that he made his decision and we're still happy and proud of him. Generic_Name was glad he finally found the perfect career for him and was very happy with it. Students will have the chance to make their own decisions in high school.

High school really wants students to make decisions and teach them that they are becoming young adults and need to understand that they can also make decision on their own. Students will be able to have the decision to go for a standard diploma or an advanced diploma. Students also have the opportunity on weather to choose to go to the army or work whenever they finish high school. Another decision students will get is what career will suit best for them. Teachers really help out students with finding the right and best career for students. For example, Generic_Name is a freshman and really wants to graduate with an advanced diploma. She is doing really well in all her classes and teachers are recommending her many careers. Generic_Name decides to go to see her counselor about which career would she enjoy best. Her counselor tells her that it is her decision on what does she really like to do and recommends her great careers. Generic_Name really struggles on what to choose but will sooner or later realize what she wants to do.

Students will be able to achieve more intelligence, learn more tasks, and open new opportunities for students to know how to identify a career. Generic_Name started high school and isn't too happy about it. He is doing decent in his classes but isn't feeling confident about finding a career, but one day whenever he got home his parents decided to find him careers and told him that they have all their support and will encourage him no matter what. Generic_Name is filled with joy and encouragement that he started to improve in his classes and is starting to find a career that knew that he would love and enjoy. He went to go talk to his counselor about careers and Generic_Name heard so many options he didn't know what to choose, but in the end he finally made up his choice and chose the career he know he would love.

BA9DA5122C58,"I think that we should have after school homework clubs in school because it can really help kids get homework done at the right time so they don't get a zero on their homework.

There is kids that get too much homework so homework club would be a good time for them to get their work done so fast that they don't need to worry about it when they get home. Some kids might struggle in one class because they have a lot of assignments that they need to make up. Homework club will give students plenty of time to get missing work done, and they should move the grade up to an A or B. You could also get homework from a bunch of different classes, and homework club will give them enough time to get the easy assignments done, so that they can focus on getting a hard assignment done, and that would leave the students with one assignment left to do.

Homework club can be seen as a way to spend your time wisely when it comes to getting homework done. It reduces the stress of getting too much homework because students will realize how much time that they have to get their work done so they can focus on the activities that they do in or outside of school.

For example, someone might have soccer practice at 5:30, and homework club might be from 2:30 to 4:50. That would give a student enough time to get a lot of work done before soccer practice. It's better to finish homework early because you would not need to worry about it for the rest of the week.

Sometimes kids need assistance from teachers because they are struggling to understand the subject, and they may need a teacher's help. The could stay at homework club so students can work with the teacher to get the work done. A student might leave an assignment at the last minute because they had other assignments to do. If homework club will give a student two hours in a half to do their assignment, they should be able to get their work done just in time. Homework club can give relief to a student when they have left an assignment at the last minute.

I believe that if a lot of kids went to homework club, then all students will be successful.

That would mean that kids will get As and Bs from now on, and they would not need to stress about their grades. It just takes students to use their time wisely at homework club to get homework done,

and no one will have any problems. ",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5
BB5D6C14712D,"I agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because, the more the try the more experiance they will get, they will get more power, they can cortrol people, and they will get freedom and respect.

Most of people are scared of losing or failing. They think failure is the end of the carrer. For example most people when they fail in business they give up, or some people don't try things because they are scared of the unknown.

One of my mintor alwasy telling me the more you try the more experiance you will get. For example i tried many types of business and i failed on some of them like i tried to do real estate i brought a house and i lost $50,000 because i didn't know how much the house worth. Also i tried Bitcoins and because i joined late i lose $7,000. But i never said i'll quit, what i did is i got a mintor his name is Generic_Name, he is doing real estate and i leanred a lot of things from him and one of my friends is good on bitcoins so i asked him to teach me and he became my mintor.

After you get the experiance you will get power and what i mean by that is it will be hard to fail. For example Bill Gates is a powerful man in business do you think he will be in debt? the answer is no it will never happend because if he lost everything he made other people will help him to success again and everybody want to work with him.

Then, you have to have a control because you don't want other people to tell you what to do. for example who has the cotrol in the hosptal? the doctors or who has the control on companys? the ceos. The reson why they have the control is they are more succesful, or more educated, or they are powerful. Another exapmle if someone has a company he will have the most cotrol because he'll be the most powerful person in the company.

The last thing you will get is the freedom and respect. As a business man what i mean by freedom is you can go where ever you want when ever you want, and what i mean by getting recpect from people are two ways the first one is when you are more educated than them and when you make more money than them.

At the end success is like the marathone, you don't want to be the first preson who get it but you want to enjoy it. ",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,2.5

There are benefits and disadvanges that school shall consider. Students, parents, teachers and other workwers members should also give their opinion abouth this new model. Their opion is very important because they will be working for an extra two hours each day but they will also have one more week day free. After school hear their opinion then school should make the decision about adopted a four-day work week.

In my opinion as student I could said that this is not a good idea, because we will have to stay for an extrea two hours in the same place which would not be good for students, be at school for 8 hours is hard for us and I could not imagine be there for a longer time. Although we will have an extra day for be with our family and do homework or any other assignment but whatever we still do all those things with the two day we have now. Shool should also consider that some teachers and worker members have their kids and they cannot be with their babysitter for a ten hours. They need to be with they family after school and do others things. Stay for two more hours will be very stressful for everyone.

School will use the same amount of energy, because they will be using a energy for two more hours each day which is equivalent if they reduced the five-week day to four-week day. The same amount of energy will be used in both ways. Make a new change will afect not only at school it will also afect society. Everyone is adapted to the sistem as it is now if thre is any change there will be needed new rules for example what students will be doing two more hours in school or what we are suppose to do with an extra free day during the week. If students have an extra day doring the week will not be beneficiary, because they can use these time to play video games or spend their time doing things that are not good for them.

If school approved the new model they will need to raise the work's wages for the two more hours of work in each day which will count as over time, because the legal hours per day for a person should work is just eight hours. In fact they will be paying more money compare to the money they are paying now. Now they are just are not paying over time. The eschool should not be adopted this new model, because they will be using more resources.

In my opinion school definite should not adopted the new model, because there are more disadvatanges than benefits. If any other school have not done before is because it is not good for students. The new chage is not neceessity for our school. The same energy will be used and there will be more resources used. For some businesses might work but it wil not work for our school. I hope my school do not decided to make this new change.                                       ",3.0,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5

The first time ever meeting you they can just be shy because there getting to know you. That's how some people work. It happens a lot in the work area. When I first went to work for my first day I was really shy and didn't talk to anybody, but now that i've been working there for 3 months and i've gotten so much comfortable with everyone there.

Once you have gotten to know the person there personality changes thought out your friendship. It makes you think who you probably met in the beginning. Sometimes they could just be lying to you just to see if your a good friend or just to make them sound better about them selves.

When you first meet someone they can for sure come off rude but then after you get to know them its like there another person. Thats how I really am, I just come off as a really mean person.

You could bump into someone and th ey probably get mad and start talking to you so rude. You'll never know they could become your best friend.

BC8115EEB029,"Being a teenager is hard in are decae. Because as a teenager growing up in this period of time is hard. If you do not follow the trend, do what others does. People will judge you and,also you might not be cool enough to have friends. But at the end of the day you have yourself respect. I agree that you should be yourself. Because you should be proud of who you are ,and will be succes, happy, and do what you good at.

Some people say, Individally we are one in order to be one only you got be proud of who you are ,nor letting anyone change you. For instance, first when I moved in here in 2016 from Egypt. I was a 14 years old. It could have affected me. When people were making fun of my English. because I did not know how to speak It ,and did not know the culture. Which It was hard for me. But I was proud of me self for trying to learn ,and still I'm learning everyday something new. It's a good feeling to feel proud of yourself. Even when people try to hate on you or make fun of you're accent. If you are a strong person nothing will stop you. From being proud ,and making you're family proud because they work hard for to be succesful in the future.

Succes is not easy. There is a lot of reason's for those who are succful. They worked hard for It. Mian reason how they became succesful is never give up. That is the key not giving up, being yourself. While people in my school having ''fun''. I stay home studying to become succesful ,and make myself proud. Also my family. Teenager should not be a follwer. Everyone should be them self. For example,There is always the good ,and bad. You choice who you hangout with. Will help you with what you wanna be in the future. If you hang with people that do sports and healty that is good because you will be succesful.

Once you do what you always had planing for in the future. You will feel happy. And to be in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else. That will even make you happier. To be more specific. Trying to be you're self while everybody is differnt is not easy. Sometimes students affor me to smoke in the bathroom. I always say no. They might laughe at me for not smoking ,and not being ''cool'' . However, I think of who I'm if I do not like doing something. I should not do it because someone else is doing it or to make other happy but not myself.

Some might say, I disagree you should not be you're self. Because other people can not be them self or might harm them self in a way. such as doing drugs,skiping school, not being respectful to you're family ,and friends. However, I think being yourself in a world that is trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. cause it makes you. proud of who you are,succesful in what you do Aslo, It makes you happy for what you have accomplish.

I think the best and awesome policy is policy number 1 , because the students need their cell phones to call their family members to pick them up. I see a lot of students use there phones in class, but maybe if you give them other free times to use it they may not use it during class periods. Having to use phones in your own free time is not a bad idea, but need to remember to turned off their phones in class.

BD8683F93B5A,"Dear Generic_Name

I understand that you are considering the benefits of working with a group or working alone. This could be a big deal depending the class because the majority of students prefer to work alone, we should use some of the time that we have in class to vote and see what students want, but i agree with the idea of working with a group for two reasons: we can devide the work and you get to talk to other students while their working.

First reason is that it feels like we do get the enough time to work, when we get to work with groups everything gets a lil bit more easy because there is less work to do, and if they decide to work alone, you would notice that they are going to have more problems completing the assignment, while the other studens that are working in group they would find this assignment more easy, so the way the teacher don't have to spend to much time with only one student.

Second reason is that they should not have problems finding the information because while some of them are writing the other students should it be serching for anwsers, for example, students that are working alone they would find this a lil bit harder because they have to do the writing and searching part by them self. The best part of working with a group is that the work can be finished a lot faster and they can have more time to recheck the work and make sure that you are not missing anything in blank.

Also, there is a lot of benefits of working with a group or working alone, but its clear that those students are not going to work with other students because they say that they don't like to be talking to other students, that they prefer to work alone, but anyways the teacher should be agree with this, thats how she would know if you need more help with the assignment then other students.

I strongly believe that working with a group could be the best choice for students because they are not going to spend to much time doing the assignments, so you could work with someone and devide the work wich positively affects, therefore, we must try it and see what benefits can we get from this and voting could be a good idea to decide if students would like to work in group.

However, in other cases students preffer the traditional four years of hihg school because in that way they are allow to take all the clasess that they need to be more prepared for their future.

Finish hihg school early can be a good idea to star thinking about the future.

Also, this can help you to chose the college that you want to go and be more focus on your future and find the job that you want.

BE928441C9D6,"I agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. I believe Churchill about what he said ''success consists of going from failure without loss of enthusiasm ''

sometimes in life you have to be a failure to be successful. For example , I know friend of mind when he first came to the USA he didn't even try to speak English.

After a while the time came and he had to learn and try when he tried he filed and filed couples times in till he be came a successful . me in person filed couples times in all SOLS

but I had fix and I kept trying and trying in till pass all of them. at the same time it might be a bad thing because some of us when they fail they give up so easy.

I sagest we should teach student about what that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.                                                                                             ",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0
BF0AF86DFDE1,"I agree with the plan of having an afterschool homework club. Because some students have a hard time finishing homework by themselves and if teachers stay with the students to help them finish their homework that would be amazing because that would mean less students failing. Also some kids might not have computers or any electronic device in their houses. Although if their is no afterschool homework club that may be good because students cant get help from any teachers and that could be good because they can know that not everything in life is easy unless you are good at it or try your best and your hardest. Another good reason that I think might be good for having afterschool homework clubs is that sudnets get a chance to enteract with other students and they also get a chance to veiw or examine how the other students do their own homework.

Some kids migh take advantage of having afterschool homework club by cheating the answers off of somebody and then leaving. So I think if the afterschool homework club shouldn't let students look at each others work until they are done. And some kids may take it as fun club and talk through the whole thing. But there is always the kids that do what they are supposed to do. They do not play around,joke around, and distract anyone from doing what they are supposed to do.

So, at the end I think that there should be an afterschool homework club because there is more details to back it up then there is for backing up not having the afterschool homework program. And alot of kids could change their work habbit and not get as much as bad grades. And mostly kids who care about their grades would want to join so there is high chance that kid do what they are supposed to do. But not having an afterschool homework program would mean that kids that really need to improve their grades would have a chance to do so and would have a chance to finish then grade they're in with good grades to start of for their next year.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5
BF580042A644,"The city council is debating on having curfews for teenagers, weekdays they have until 10 p. m and on the weekends they have until midnight. This is for the teenagers to be safe and not be out late because something could happen to them if they are out on the streets at night. This rule would be an outstanding one because they can cause less trouble and they can stay out of trouble at the same time. This rule won't interfere with young peoples life, it would keep them safe at home and their parents don't have to worry about them doing anything bad. The teenagers can be talking to their friends, loved ones, and family on their phone or be playing with them on PlayStation or Xbox.

My first reason why I think they should the adopt the curfew rule is because it keeps them at home and keeps them safe. For an example, if your teenager stays home and doesn't go out passed his curfew then he or she won't get hurt or even worse shot by a dangerous person . If the city council adopt the curfew rule they can prevent your son or daughter from getting beat up or getting shot . This rule can prevent anything dangerous happening to your son or daughter, this will keep them inside and they can study, catch up on miscomplete assignments , and do homework. You won't have to worry about them that much because you know they are safe at home and won't try to get you in a serious problem. It's also your job as parents to keep watch out on your son or daughter because they can try sneaking out. The city council can't really do anything about your teenager sneaking out from your house so you are responsible for watching your kid.

My second reason why I think the city council should adopt the curfew rule is to keep your teenager from breaking the law and to keep them from doing horrible things. To demonstrate, If your teenager is not out on the street then he or she can be drawing or painting on paper instead of doing graffiti on building or walls . This could prevent teenagers from getting in trouble and prevent people from cleaning up the teenagers own mess. If you have talent to draw amazing objects then try showing it in school or on your personal items and not on the cities property. I suggest buying a ton of paper or objects that you can paint on instead of doing graffiti on buildings or walls own from the city council. If your teenager is caught doing this , he or she is gonna be in a serious problem and they will have to clean it.

My final reason why I think it's important to have a curfew rule is because this will prevent your teenager from doing illegal things such as drinking or doing drugs. We don't know what our kid could be doing passed curfew so I think we need this curfew so we can make sure they are not doing anything illegal. This keeps our kid safe and also out of trouble because its horrible to be drinking and doing drugs. For an example ,If your teenager was caught doing illegal things and doing it passed curfew , it would be extremely terrible and your teenager would be in a whole lot of trouble. This is why having a curfew and checking on your kids room once in awhile will help you prevent this from happening and also keep your teenager from having a black out, crashing or a overdose. If your teenager has some bad friends, tell your kid to stop talking to them because they might try forcing him or her to do something that they do not want to do. Instead of doing those things , just talk to your loved ones, friends, and family on the phone or play with them on PlayStation or Xbox.

As a result, having a curfew on weekdays and weekends is important because this could prevent anything from happening to your teenager. I do not think they interfere with young peoples life but keep them safe from anything happening to them , keep them from breaking the laws and getting in trouble by the police .My three main reasons from having a curfew were to keep them from doing anything illegal, to keep them from getting hurt or killed,

to keep them from doing graffiti on buildings and walls, and makes the parent communicate with the teenager and see what they are doing .One last important thing is to always communicate with your teenager because they want your help but deep down they won't ask for it , so it's important to check up on them once an awhile and see how they are doing.

This is why I think the city council should adopt the curfew rule . The curfew rule is an outstanding rule and I think more city councils should adopt it as well.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

Because being our self is mean trust our self. Not believing to any one who come to as, and till as any thing to Change as. then reaching our goal by trusting our self. For example. Being our self shows those people how strong we can be,and continuing our way to improve.

In a word that we see people change accomplishment. We should trust our self to not change. To a bad person, or any thing that a society try to make as.

Also they try to change as as the way they want it. To follow their way, and we know that it is not the way we can improve. So to be our self, and we chose to improve our life in other rule. It is because we see something that is not going right, but the society has changing. Also it looks when those people try to improve, and they get that, they heard other people. and they dont know they rich something they effect some other thing that they dont know about about.

I believe it is not acceptable for as to do the same to heard some people. Then we should follow some other way to our life.

Clearly "" is society that is constantly trying to make as change in highest improvement.(Author Ralph Waldo Emerson) I should believe to my self. That i can rich my goal successfully. progress on the thing that i need and want. So i should not let ant one to turn me from my goal. Because there is some people who want as, to not rich our goal or dreams. To advents my self i would work so hard. But is some people who is trying to fail as in our way to rich our goal. Then going to embrace as for are fail, also try to stop as to rich that dream. But i believe if we trust our self, and have a big goal to rich to. It will be possiball to get it. Then no one can get our way to stop as.

being our self trusting to our goal, and respect our self, makes people to respect as. As will as we do to them. Also reaching our goal dreams In a right way. But being in a society that people as changed. then try in to change me. SO i see the can improve but in not right way, and not respect between people. So then i believe i should be my self.

It is important to have a good attitude because people can face their obstacles, it gives them many opportunities and experiences to learn.

Nobody is perfect in the world, everyone has obstacles to face forward. But having a good attitude can help them to face their obstacle, it help them to never give up, like famous actors of movies, shows, and many more. Before they came to be famous they face their obstacles to be someone in life. They past through many things to be came successful, but they face them with a good attitude and yep sometimes with bad attitudes. Some actors still have some obstacles to face, but they face them with good attitudes.

On the other hand, having a good attitude gives people many opportunities. People often have opportunities but they don't know how to confront them. A positive attitude helps people in their life because it gives them many opportunities, like

Generic_Name always has a positive attitude even during in a difficult time.

Otherwise, having a good attitude gives people many experiences. Experiences appears in people life so they can learn from them, but having a good attitude makes then more fun and interesting. One of the experiences that learn is that when you give money or food to a homeless they shared it with other homeless with a positive attitude. They think about others, even when they don't have to much. A person once said, When give more, you receive more, that is true because when the homeless shared something with others they receive more but they wait with a positive attitude is like they feel happy, they have a good attitude but at the same not all of them have a positive attitude some of them have a negative attitude because they had a hard time.

Overall, having a good attitude can help people anywhere in the world. A good attitude help people in their future they have obstacles to face, opportunities to take, and amazing experiences to learn. Sometimes people imagine their life with having a bad attitude, and everything that they have will be rare because they will not have the chance to learn or to experience. To the contrary of people with good attitudes are awesome because they are intelligent and they have an incredible wisdom.

Accomplishment comes with many struggles and steps. Not just anyone makes it through; some give up because maybe others told them that not everything is for them.

Being honest can lead you to many benefits and help you in many ways right now and in the future too. When being honest, people will start trusting you with a lot of things. But you've got ot be careful with what you do or say. You can get a lot of good benefits in life. A benefit of telling the truth all the time is building new friendships and meeting new people.

On the other hand, people will have that mindset thinking that being honest is a bad thing. As you start lying more often, it can become a bad habit which you might regret later in life. Now if there's a case where you're trying to tell the truth, those same people that you have been lying too won't believe you. A negative effect that can ruin you is like losing friendships or losing a job based on the way you've been acting. Also, being dishonest can make people think that they can't trust you. Those people that you're lying too might think you're a bad person.

You can show integrity to lots of people which can be by listening to them and telling them the good and the bad. Think of yourself like a role model to other people and having a positive mindset. If you show integrity, people will start looking up to you. Also, have a good explanation to the reason why you're lying to that person, well that's if they find out one day. Besides, if you had a good reason for lying that other person might forgive you.

I learn how to bould on fornite. I learn how to bould and sauces by my cousin. Lastly when I learn how to aim on fornite. I learn because of my cousin and he teach me how. Learning a skill Is better then not to.

At school we can see different kinds of age some guys are older that others, so maybe some students want to finish school a early time, If the students finish school early they can be more independent, and see how life goes life isn't easy and all of us one day will learn how to be more independent. Be independent it is a responsibility because you have to take care about something as; pay some bills, if you have car, well take care about the insurance, for some reason you live by yourself have to pay where do you live, and other responsibilities.

Second, make money a early age is a amazing thing to do because you will prepare for the future your goal is finish school, and maybe that would require extra effort like take courses during the summer, or work in the evenings to make up things that you need to do in another class, maybe that require extra work.

Nevertheless is it not a good idea for students, because they tired more early, bring more focus on some classes but not in the others, and they not take a break on summer.

They can be tired more early because some time they worry for the work that they have . For example, students pass more time study and not take a break. Most students going to school sleep because in the night they study for exams, or make some proyect that they left. most of them have many homework and they not finish on time because they are tired and need to sleep to going with energy on the school though they are not finish the homework. In concept the students need more time to make the school work because if they take the offer to graduate in three years they need to give everything on time.

Most of them bring more focus on some classes that others because they think that some classes are more important and the others not. Nevertheless the grades can be going down for the reasons that the students not put attention on classes, or not make the work. Also they need to make the work of the all classes because that importan, and all classes they need for graduate. This can be give them problems if they not make anything for they grades going up because if they have bad grades they can not graduate in three years. Clearly the students forget the importan that all classes are for graduate.

The students not take a break on summer because they want to going the summer school for make more classes. For example, they make this for graduate more early but, they do not have time for they family or for the work. Many time they need to work on summer and this affect most students, they going the school in the morning and the night they work. some families going anothers countries for vacation and the students can not going for the reason that they need to stick for study. Clearly going on summer school affect students but, this can be help for advance classes.

In conclution some school help students to graduate more early like in three years. The students can be tired because they want to make the more importans classes, but this is more hard. They bring more focus in the importants classes and the others classes not. Most of them need to going on summer school because they need to pass the classes.

I believe that is not the best choose a student's to practice this work to build self- esteem; for many reason, because some people don't has the idea if the student's are agree or disagree this is no the best way to improve in their self-esteem to practice on praising. And other is they need to improve in their achievement, because they are not sure if this come from praise or achievement. Also students they has the last world, if they need to practice the things the some people thinking to the benefit for their self-esteem.

1. Reason some people don't has the idea if the student's are agree or disagree, i think this is not the best way to improve in their self-esteem, because students they believe in praising but, this is not the option to learn in their self-esteem they need to focus in their achievements. even if some people belief on praising,they think this help students to believe in praising i think students believe in this source but is not the principal option to believe in praising they need to focus in their achievements, values and skills because is one the priority and purpose to believe in their self-esteem this ideas must be to help to lean focus.

Students need to improve in their achievements, because some people are not sure if this come from, praise or achievements. I think this are two different thinks, also one is believe in religion, for example: I belief in Jesus this is praise they don't need to compare, but i don't dismiss this idea,because is good idea to students believe in praising. Another is achievement this come from the goals you made and the effort you did it for your accomplishments.

Also students their has the last word, if they need to practice the things the some people thing, to the benefit for their self-esteem, but the two are good idea for instill students don't believe, if this is the correct option, also they need to make the best effort to practice the best way to help their career in the future.

In conclusion the students dont need to practice thing that some people thinks,to improve to help and learn more about self-esteem, this is one the purpose to improve their self-esteem, this is optional in what you believe if their praising or achievements but this two different things, but is good idea learn both for better self-esteem to understand.

C454239AC43D,"I don't think our school needs to follow this model by extending school for an extra two hours. We need to be in school for seven days a week to learn and be productive in working on assignments, projects, tests or quizzes. We also be in school to be active in working and socializing with students and teachers. If we are in school for a seven day period, then students and teachers would involved in helping each other more and getting some work done that they were absent for or helping them work they have to turn in or they need help understanding the information they are given.

My first reason is that we should be in school for seven days instead of 4 days. If we are in school for seven days, then the students would be learning more about what certain topics the teacher is talking about. Another thing is that students can work hard on assignments that are due within two days or week. Also if they if are absent or just need help , then students can make up work by staying after school to catch on anything they have missed or just come in for extra help if they need it. One example would be if I were absent for like day or more, I could make up the the assignments that I missed by staying after school to make them up. Or having to just coming in to get extra help on assignments that I don't get or having trouble on.

My second reason would be that teachers will be there for seven days to help you with anything. If you don't get what assignment is asking or understand it, then a teacher can help you by reading it to you or explain it to you. Teachers will be there everyday to help you with anything that will help you succeed in their class. Also they will be there to help motivate you in getting good grades in any of your classes and passing them. My second example would be If I didn't understand the information or just give up on the assignment, a teacher would be by my side. they would motivate me to never give up and always try to do your very best on any assignment that was difficult for me.

My third reason would be students would be engaging with other classmates. Students and classmates don't have to only engaged in helping each other with assignments. During a seven day week, students can talk with their classmates or friends during lunch or if the teacher allows you to talk. Also your classmates or friends would love to ask you if want to participated in after school activities or clubs. My third example would be If my classmates or my friends ask if you want stay after, I would say yes. Then I would get involved with my with my classmates or friends and start talking with them.

Some people think that having a four day school week would be better for them. They think if they have school for four days only, they would have nothing worry about. Like for example, they wouldn't worry about much work needs to be done or how the work will affect how they are. Also what grade you will get on a assignment or when to turn in your assignments.

Some people think that having a four day school week for be bad for them. Students would be worrying about what they got on a assignment or test. Others would be panicking when to turn in assignments or when you can make up a test or quiz. Like for example, If students only had four school days to turn in assigments or make up a test or quiz, then it make the students feel bad for themselves or they can feel sad and sorry for themselves. Also they wouldn't know how they did on a assignment,test,quiz and what grade they got on it.

In conclusion, Students and teachers would much rather a seven day school week then a for four day school week. Then students can work hard on their work, while the teacher will be there to help with help or any questions that you have. Also if the students are having any trouble besides work, then the teacher will be by your side to help you or motivate you to make you feel proud of youself.",4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0
C495D1E686C0,"From my point of view, this is a good idea because most students have a different situation in their life. Sometimes, they woud like to become an independent person, so nobody can coerce to do something even their parent. In my eyes, it is not important that the students finish high school in three year or four year. After graduating from high school, they are a good person, aren't they?. I think this is a most important problem. To me, the students should be a good citizen because the society needs them to develop. A good behavior is more necessary than graduation, and they have to practise or use the lesson that were learned in high school, so they will get a lot of experience.

The life is an adventure, discovery, and study. Day by day, everything is changing rapidly. Due to this problem, the student not only study in textbook, or document but also learn from substantial. When we face up with difficult problem, it gives us more valuable experience in the life, i think this experience is too hard to find in book, or school. If you graduate in high school early it will give you more time to learn new things from your life, so you will grow up and have a lot of opportunities to success in life. For instance, Generic_Name who i admired, was a founder the Coffee Shop Company in my country. He was still graduate high school early and then i worked for his company. At that time, he was learning how to grow a special coffee, which is the only one not only in vietnam but also over the world. At the present,

his company is the best coffee company in Vietnam. He said to me that difficulty, experience are the keys to success. Actually, the life is a challenge: it isn't easy to you. If you would like subdue it you have to prepare everything as soon as you graduate high school. Therefore, the student finish high school early; it is very neccessary to prepare for new challenges in the life.

As we can see, the economy is delicated and various, so you have more time to find an occupation which is suitable for you. I believe that 50% senior were confusing about their future because most of their time is in school, class, which forgot going ouside to expand your knowledge and doing some part-time jobs to get new lessons. In my opinion, most of people fall down in their life because of lacking of experience.

In short, i support this idea because it make us mature, independent. Besides, we have more chance to success and to do new things. It's also a good way to demonstrate your ability",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,3.0,4.0
C49F716838E7,"Should students attend to year-round schools?

Considering year-road schools they are good for students to attend too because they retain more information,students stay in school,and become more responsible students.

In my point of view, I think they are too expensive,students do not spent time with family or friends,and dont have the opportunity to have new experiences in life; for example having a summer job.

For example the experience I had in life with year-round schools was in Generic_City, when I lived their with my family for over ten years after living in the United States for nine years for my life; and for my parents for over twenty year of living in the United States; moving to Generic_City was a big change of life to my family. My parents wonted the best for me and my brothers, so we attended to a year -round school. It was not easy being their because me and my brothers did not know much Spanish but know is are first language. Also it was too expensive,and students did not spend time with family, all kids do is attend to school all year.

After me and my brothers finish up are year in that school, my parents decided to move us to a normal school to spend more time in home, and have more life experience. It was so much better being in a normal school because I had more time in school vacation as a student, also had a summer job, and more time for me and family.

Also I experence more new thing in my normal school like being part of a band, playing for the school soccer team,being part of the drill team enjoying school like kids shoud do.

In my point of view student should not attend to year-round school because some students have part time job,it too expensive attend at year-round schools , and some students plan family vacation out of the country to spend time together.

But having this year-round school some students retain more information and stay focus to learn more information. Also by not attending to year-round schools some students have more life experience and become responsible in life.

In conclusion i consider students should attend to normal schools because they are less expensive,students can have a part time job, and also have some more life experience to help them become more responsible persons.     ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0

Also they can be more friendly with other people. Some people can be more secure in their life's with a positive attitude.

Positive attitude can help them in school. For example students with a good attitude can have a good behavior in school, they can obey directions from the teachers and respect their classmates.

For this very reason, being home schooled and having online courses gives you the chance to have more time to do your work, reevaluate, and overall to take as long as you may need, and whats important is feeling comfortable and moving at your own pace.

Although, some may take this as an advantage or opportunity to try and fit in extracurricular activities and or to try and learn new things because maybe they want to pursue something different that needs more time of something and less time of a seven hour education course that restricts them of doing so because school takes up almost of half of the time in their every day life.

Online classes can often help people but make it harder for other people to learn, sometimes you'll need a buddy to help out or you'll need a teacher to ask questions to learn but people may take online courses because they feel that they can work better alone rather than to be working with others and thats where they could be in the wrong.

You're not always going to know everything, you have to give yourself the chance to open up and have the opportunity so that you could expand your knowledge of education, there's a point in time where you've got to say ask a classmate or teacher for help, and Im not speaking on the behalf of everyone but thats how people are, they think they can learn everything there is to know about something but you've got to take a step back and know when to say hey and say these five simple words and that is, ""may I get help please"".

As a result, more ideas are developed and productivily improves. Working together prepare students for future jobs and careers. Two or more people are always better than one for solving problems. However, it is an importan skill to be able to get along with others and it is valued by employers.

Everyone has heard people saying ""Two minds are better than one"" This quote has never rang more true, and all of the ideas it promotes reflect crystal clear off a group work. Working in a group can reduce the amount of work you need to do, as well as make things a lot more efficient. Things are also finished much quicker because of the way many people can split up different jobs in a group, and people with differents skill sets can do what they're best at. This broader range of skills can also be used to help other group members. The diversity found within a group of people is one of the most powerful resources a person can have when it comes to finishing a task.

Though multiple ideas are helpful, and it is less work to be in a group. Sometimes working alone is beneficial as well. It really depends on the circumstances you're placed in, and the people you are around to say wether or not working in a group is benign or unremunerative. Though working alone can be better for one's own reasons, such as anxiety, paranoia, worry about others preferences, or simply because you prefer to work alone. Oftentime students will learn and experience more in group of their peers than working alone, which is better for the futures and possibly what lies ahead.

Working together creates less work and allows more work to be completed faster. It allows constructive criticism from other members of the group, which promotes a better final product in the end. Overall, working together is beneficial because it creates differents points, new ideas are generated. Different points of view create divesity and diversity is the key to success.",4.5,4.5,5.0,4.5,4.5,4.5

The addition of two hours to the school day will benefit the school poorly but,

will cause a huge disadvantage to students and the school as a whole. The four - day work week will not be beneficial to my school because,

it would reduce the amount of time students have for other activities,

and also this will result in the inability of students to learn more, and as a result students are affected mentally and psychologically.

To begin with, the school day has been designed in a special way which gives students, a reasonable amount of time to involve themselves in after school activities. These activities help the students acquire other skills different from what we acquire in school. For example, students who also take part in sports do not have enough time to practice or train after school if these 2 hours are added. Other students who work after school will begin to work fewer hours because they also need time to study and revise. As a student, time is needed to attain your goals and time also determines your future.

In addition to, the student brain can't function as well as an adult brain after some hours of serious work .The brain becomes tired and needs rest after some time, but the adult brain can do more because it is well developed than the student brain. After lunch, the students can study to a maximum of 3 hours only before feeling sleepy or tired and if these hours are extended, students will feel reluctant to study, which makes these extended hours a waste of time. Due to this, students won't take these hours seriously but will only disturb or disrupt the class which produces no positive result at the end of the class. The school makes sure that wastage of time is extremely prevented to produce positive outcomes and results.

Furthermore, to become a successful student, individuals must be mentally upright and psychologically sound to allow learning to be much easier and convenient. If these 2 hours are added to the school day, the students won't be mentally stable because, they would be stressed from pushing themselves to learn more even tho they are tired. Psychologically, this will reduce a student's ability to understand new things being thought and also prevents them from revising past information or work given. If this is happens, students will begin to forget past information and how to apply them which will become a problem in the near future.

Conclusively,this four - day work week would benefit other other institutions but won't benefit an institution like my school because my school works and remains successful mainly by the use of precious time and effort.

think is better to work in group because has a lot of benefits. One of the example is the group help to think better,

each other and fast. second the workes is help to earn more money for the company and for the workes.

The first reason the workes is help to find information and internet or and books when some one had a problem like some one in the group is sick the other ones substitute in a job, sometimes in a group has a lot inconvenient like someone disagreement but then can fix an any problem to solve because they are professional.

The second reason is to earn money and hours,

when the workes work great an a job the company is pay more better , in a group is more beneficial for the company and for workers an extra hours,

because they do more efficient job, and also workes can help to earn more business with other companies and other countries more practical to work in a group they can help each other.

In conclusion I think is more beneficial to work in a group for several reason one of then is more easy to think in group help each other when the work is difficulty. Other reason is more practical to work and earn money for company and for workers and its beneficial to work with other companies.

C78951522AC0,"Dear, manager i want to know more about your business. What opportunities do you give your employees? I want to know new things from your business. I would love to go and have a position there. I'm interested to give it a try in your business. A professional like you can teach me how everything works and how you maintain everything under control with your employees. Also, it be delightful if i could ask questions about how is it difficult to be such a big person as a manager?

Therefore,I choose your company because I feel like its great for me to start working in a place that i could be conformable with. And specially if its from a company with great quality and management. Also i can learn how to socialize with people. Learning how to communicate is important for a company so everything is in order. Some companies don't know how to communicate and to be organize. They've to be anti-social so they can focus on their work and not on other employees otherwise there's consequence. Some companies are very strict with their employees. For examples employees have to be obedient to every single thing. As in they've to follow every step correctly or they would get fired or worst.

Thirdly, Your company is understandable to your employees. You treat them with respect and love as if they were your family. I heard that if your employees had a emergency you would be generous and support them no matter what. I never heard one complain from your company either. However, its the exact opposite. people who works there seems to love it and to enjoy it! They've learned to be responsible and respectful in your company. You also are fair with your employees. Employees in that company gets payed well with no complains. They get payed exact the hours they've been working.

However, the way you manage your customers is incredible. Your customers are never disappointed what they order is exactly what they get. Employees always have a smile on their faces when receiving a customer. They're always gentle and polite. But more importantly patient because they're a lot of customers who are slow or aggressive, they like to get attention. As great employees they handle any challenges. And i think it's a perfect start for me because I'll do everything right with no excuses. In the other hand, your company is always nice and neat you make sure that the place looks good and prepared just in case important visitors come to visit your company.

Mean while, i think the environment needs more companies as an this one. because everything about this company is splendid and spectacular. They've great service and employees. They make sure their customers come in and out happy. Your company takes responsibility for any errors that could happen. You also give great deals for customers. you teach your employees have to be a great worker. You give your employees plenty of time to get along with their job because you know that in the future they will do way much better. You also persuade your employees that they can do anything. That giving up is not a answer. I would like to be a outstanding person for your company. I want to tell everyone about how amazing your company is and how wonderful everyone who work there is. The organization in your company is great you keep everything in order.

In conclusion, I think i am very interested in learning about your company more and actually try to work there. I want to feel that joy and that responsibility i have to have. I want to spend time learning and practicing in your company. Your company has shown me that not all companies are bad as they say nor terrible. In my opinion i think companies should be more like this one. So if i could get the opportunity to go and check it out and learn that would be amazing. Because i never heard of a company this generous before. And i would definitely would love to know more about it. Everything about your company is great for example communication,organization,employees and deals. It sounds entertaining and enjoyable. This is a enormous deal for me. So Mr. Manager i would like to go and visit it. I could also work that exact day if you want me to it would be a pleasure to work in a amazing company.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,2.5
C79292B5F78A,"My thoughts on this are that it is good time and this should actually occur for many reasons first of all during the weekdays young people have school everyday only if it is a holiday or if sick. By implying this more young people will get out of the streets so late at night there is no need to be out so late at night in the first place. Second of all, at 10 p. m is a great time to be home during the weekdays it will keep you out of trouble and there will be less chances of young people dying to other criminals at night. Late at night is where most of all crimes occur and now the chances of this will be lower. Third of all , as their are so many people that sell drugs and if young people have to be home so early the chance of them getting into all types of drugs will be so much lower.

If this does become a law the times are also very appropriate Monday through Friday until 10 p. m and then Saturday through Sunday until 12 p. m no one needs to be on the streets later then this time that is being given. If they are their out so late there should be a extreme reason as to why they would be ""breaking the law"". This will most likely keep young people out of more troubles then they all ready are. This time is not unfair it is a very generous time to be home. This really should not be interfering with any ones life you can still go out but not be out for so late at night. I would understand if this law was also for people over the age of 18 because young adults like to party. But this law should actually be for people under the age of 18 that would make more sense and being a ""adult""(over the age of 18) they know what is right from wrong,what they should be doing, and what they should not be doing.

This law is not to harm anyone but it would to improve the community curfews to keep teenagers out of trouble I can very much agree with that. But those young teenagers are not doing the right thing then no matter what law that is added nothing will change the fact of how they act(keep them out of trouble). Going back to the time it is not like this law will be implying that the young people do not hang out with their friends this is just so more people can stay safe from all the trouble that is the streets. A lot of innocent people die every year by being so late at night and in the streets where some of the bad people come out. They have all after school to be doing after school activities this will not keep anyone from doing what they want. It is just a way to keep young people out of trouble there should be excuses to all of this like going to a party but there as well should be a limit to all of this. The consequence if they break the law should start of as a warning and then just be adding on to that.

My position on this curfew law is also that I would understand why people do not want this to happen but at the same time teenagers do know what they should be doing and what they should not be doing. I have two different view points why they should be worried and why they should not be worried. I know that people like to have sleep overs and would this be included or do they have to specifically in their house on can they be sleeping at someone else . Back into my other view if they go to a party lets say over the weekend where the curfew is at 12 p. m because it is on a Saturday and they come back at 1 p. m or later .They are not keeping track of time and lose the time. They are having fun with all of their friends and then they get caught because someone calls the police. Then the police comes and now they have to face the law and all that. Now what is next that being on their record just because they stayed out longer then they had and were on the streets. This would honestly suck and then going home and getting in trouble by your parent because of a mistake you made. After all this wanting to go to a very good college and they not accepting them just because they made a mistake for staying to late at the party. This would be a down side because if anyone breaks the law that will go on there record and not come out of there permit sadly this is a consequence that can happen and would suck. A college not accepting them because they "" broke the law"" not fun at all because colleges do look at everything anyone does before getting accepted and being a very good student with a high GPA and hearing this would not be good they will be carrying that guilt for their whole life by not getting into the college that they want to get into.

On the other note right now there is not a curfew to what time teenagers should be home yet but there is a curfew to when who ever has their permit for driving. So that is also a big restriction no young teenager is out in their car at a late time the only time you can actually see them is when they are getting out of school. There are pros and cons to this ""law"" but I think there are mostly pros then cons everything is very much reasonable and understanding. The only down/con that I can personally thin of right now is that they get caught and that going in their record does not sound good at all. But overall there are a lot of pros to this and this law should be seriously implied to all of the United States not only to one city but to all of them. This will keep more people safe yes pf course there is always that one person who wants to break the law as a joke or something that really should not be anything to play around with or anything but something that all young people listen to it take it serious.

In conclusion this law or curfew will stop all of these thieves from stealing young girls or boys and then selling them as well as to stop rape from happening so much because sometime it is very hard to detected people because of how dark it is. But this will most likely lower the chance of all these negative things to happen so frequently to anyone. It will also keep young people out of lots of trouble by being so late at night less danger.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0
C7BD62EA392F,"Dear Principal:

I personally don't think its a good idea that your considering changing school policy so that people may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average.

Sports has nothing no do with school, that's just another activity that's after school and the better you play sports the better your going to be good at school, specially with your grades. It keeps you organized and makes you stay on topic. For people sports are really important and really fun to play, it makes you runs and concentrated on how you play. You might think that for some reason that's why people are getting a bad grade average, but its not like that. I consider that sports are really important to me, and even if i don't play in a team i still love to play any kind of sport. It keeps me awake and motivated. It keeps me from stop being lazy all the time. There are 2 main reasons why i don't think its a good idea that you should change that policy. My first main reason is sports have nothing to do with school ,is just another amazing activity that people would enjoy instead of just watching TV or being on the computer. My second reason is like my mom always told me a story. When she was little and lived back in Mexico, she would tell me all about her childhood and what she would do at my age. She used to tell me that she would run every morning to exercise and breath the fresh air outside, after that she would be with my grandfather and helping him with everything that she could and then she would play Basketball with her friends. Having a little challenge to see who would win and just to have fun. I remember asking her if sports had to do anything with school? if that was an activity to bring my grades up ?' What she said Exactly was "" They invented sports so that kids, teenagers and people would have a routine and be a better person. Believe it or not mostly for teenagers, sports brings there grade up and well organized , and when i started playing sports, it did bring my grade up. What the captains do is that they show you how to be on time and do all your assignments so its similar to sports.''

I'll never forget the message that my mom gave me about sports.

C82037D6072F,"Befits For An Extra Hour of School

85% of students who study more can pass more test. I feel like some students could befits from an extra half an hour of school because it could help students learn more. Also some students struggle with some subjects so it could also befits some students who can not stay back. School should add an extra half of a hour to school because it could help students get more education, better job opportunity, and help students to be better prepared for test.

First, students with more education could help students lead to success. Education is helpful because it is need in a lot of daily activities. Education is also super important because it is through out life. Also some students who want to get in a good collage but do not have the money for it if they have a good education they can get in for free but they have to have good grades. Some students might want to become a teacher but might not have the right education for that so that why education is important.

Second, students could have better job opportunity. Some students would not like the job they get. Also students with good education could give students a job they want. Another thing a better job could make the students get more money from higher paying job and also some students could want to become a teacher. Students also do not have to worry about how much they are getting paid and what type of job they have. Some students could have a better job opportunity if they get an extra 30 minutes because they get more education are more likely to pass their test.

Third, students will be better prepared for test. Some students struggle with a lot of test because they can not stay back. So I think an extra 30 minutes could help students get a little more education and it could help students learn more and be better prepared for test. An also passing test is important because it is one of the highest grade and if u fail them it could make your grade go down a lot. An some student may struggle and that could help student do more activities and maybe they can pass more.

In conclusion, I think an extra 30 minutes could hep students get more education. It is also good for some student. It will also help students be better prepared and it could let them lead to success. So I feel like an extra 30 minutes is not that long so some student would also not mine. So it could benefits some student to make them more successful.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
C825937F3BF1,"Students committing to a career at a young age can actually be very helpful. Although, some students prefer not to be committed to a specific career in their high school years. Some students just like to take their time and explore new things and that way it can give them ideas about what to do in the future. Other students just decide what to do when they are in college. That being said, committed at young age, exploring new things, deciding in college.

Students being committed at a young age is helpful and will benefit themselves for the future. Students sticking to one area for their career at a young age and just being focused on it is what they need in order to get there. Especially if they are focusing and putting hard work at a young age. However, some students may not enjoy having to just stick with one area. Students will not be able to enjoy what other students enjoy. Exploring new things at the young age is very fun.

With students being committed at a young age and all, exploring new things at a young age is very fun. Students do not have to worry or stress about being committed to just one thing. Students exploring at a young age will have more opportunities to see what they like. Students will enjoy more of their time rather than other students who are committed to one thing. Unless if students really love to what they are committed to, they wont enjoy much of their time. For example, if one student is committed to one thing but does not love what he is doing and the other student who is exploring new things and enjoying his time, then the student exploring will enjoy more of his time and be happy as well.

Being committed at a young age, exploring new things are fun but Lastly, students decide what to do as they enter college. Students deciding as they head to college is pretty tough. Some students wont be able to prepare for whats coming. For example, if students had chose what to do while they were in high school then they would have time to prepare for what they would be doing in college. But choosing what to do as you head in to college can be tough for some students.

In conclusion, being committed at a young age is good and beneficial for students but it can get boring and sad, unless if students truly love what they are doing. Students entering college and immediately deciding what to do without actually knowing anything about what they chose is not so fun. Now students who explore new things at a young age is what most students should do. This way they know what they will enjoy and what they wont enjoy. Students can do whatever they want to at a young age. Once students find what they love. They can stick to it and have it as their career. ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0

I think that this is an good idea because if the school follow this model by extending the school day two hours the benefits are you have more time for study and complete all your work three days to relax in home and do your homework or get a jod and work for three days all this is a benefits.

C8DF8FD0D69D,"""Succes consists of going from failure to failure without loss enthusiasm"".

-Former British Minister Winston Churchill

Immigrants who came from differents countries to United States are the most strongest people in the world.

These people really know what failure means and how brave they are to leave their families and find the success that they could not get on their countries.

That's the meaning of this statement and I'll explain you why I am agrre with this powerful phrase.

I believe that immigrants who came to United States are the strongest people because they have to do a lot of sacrificies before to come here, for example, some parents live theirs children with their grandparents or take the risk to come with them even knowing how hard is the way to come to America.

Its really difficult to come to a new country without know the lenguage, the city, and what kind of peolpe will you find in the way, some are good persons who helps them some of them are racist, they start from cero without a hosue, a car, a good job, being alone and so far from their families, this is how they get the strength to keep moving up and help their families in their countries.

They are the best example for this statement to teach us how can we start from down in a new place and get the opportunity to be in the top without never give up making clear our goals and purposes,

sometimes we want to do something that we really love but we feel afraid to fail, but if we never try we never going to know how it feels like to see ours dreams realized. If you believe in what you think , then it worths and do not let anyone tell you that you can not.

I'm agree with this statement because it shows us a different way to see what we call difficult or imposible to make. When the things are getting hard just think in the price that you will earn at the end or how proud you will be for made that thing that you wanted to do and someone told you that you could not make. Just be as an immigrant, brave, able, capable to risk all that they have to get a new opportunity, a different way of live but always thinking about the yearned price.

I hope you have an idea about this statement means , and do not give up on your dreams and the goals that you made some day thinking about make them reallity and if you always want to triumph you have to spend time on it.

Students cannot be benefited of taking online classes because students might not take notes and that the students might not pay attention to the teacher.

Students might not take notes while being on a class that is online. For example, at school, students take notes because they are being watched by the teacher, so why would they do it if they are not being watched by the teacher; the students would not care about the notes. If the teacher is on the screen, but cannot see if the student is taking notes; most likely there are not because the students won't worry that the teacher could check them. Students should take notes when they get information about a topic, so that topic could stay in the mind of the student if they write it and they also try understand the topic from the notes. Teacher's won't even know there students are taking notes because it's online they cannot see them. also the students might not be paying attention.

The students might not pay any attention to the lecture the teacher is giving to them. For example, when a student looks around the classroom, but not at the teacher, they will miss valuable information that is needed, so it's like the same when it comes to online classes; information will be missed by the students. Missing information when distracted is terrible because students might miss out on what is going on in the class, might miss on something on they have to do, and miss on how to do there work. Students should pay attention; no one likes to miss any key information; therefore, students need to look at the teacher to get more information as needed to do an assignment. When students don't take notes, they will not only miss out on some key information, but might panic on how to do a problem on the assignment they were given.

The students cannot benefit from taking online classes because the students might not write valuable information in there notes and they might not pay attention to lecture that teacher is giving to them. The students won't take any notes because no one is watching them take the notes as the teacher goes on lecturing.

Don't matter if we are youngs, we can learn everything. Some people think that the students can not identify a career by the time they enter to high school. Two years ago when I entered to high school

I was not sure what I want to be. Now, I know what I want to be, but that is thanks to my school that they have many ideas how we can identify a career. The last year I was in Internship class that was great because they give me the opportunity to get a job. The job was about secretery I was in love with this job; however, was not easy to learn but I liked. I would like to be a secretary. It is a good idea for students to commit to a carreer at a young age because we can mature our mind, develop our skills, and develop our passions. We are students of high shcool, and we can identify a career and more many things.

To begin, When we learn about career we can start to mature our minds. Students in high school get experiences learn about how they can find a job. In Generic_School my school, we have Internship class. This class consist to help students to find a job and they can see how to work in the comunity. Students develop their emotional knowledgel; also, we start to proceed as adult. We learn that the work is a big responsability. That's why we have to start to know about careers in high school. It is so important identify what we want to do when we grow-up.

Additionally, develop our skills is a great idea that can help us. Many students learn many laguages this is a great skill because we can travel every where, comunicate with other people, know other cultures; also, if we speak differents languages we can earn more money, get a better job. We can develop many many skills if we wants. Just we need to try. If we wants a great career we need to put in practice the dicipline. We can do everything what we want because we are intelligents,positives,and great students. keep going becauses that's is the only way that we have.

Lastly, When we develop our passions we can get a good career. If we have something that would like to be for example: doctors, secretary, actors, or nurse whatever we want. I would like to say go head! we can do it. The life is a challenge if we don't try we can never get a good career. Firts step we need to faces our fears. Second step we need to put all our efforts every day. Students in high school need to know these two steps. Students have all the capacity to learn everything, so let's go to do it.

To summarize, all the students should identify a career in high school. Students develop their emotional knowledgel; also, we start to proceed as adult.

Many students learn many laguages this is a great skill because we can travel every where, comunicate with other people, know other cultures; also, if we speak differents languages we can earn more money, get a better job. develop our skills is so important. The life is a challenge if we don't try we can never get a good career. Is for these reasons and many other that students should indentify a career in high school.",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0
CA7CE4CE7ED3,"Has there been anyone in your life that shared any wisdom or experience with you? If not, why not ask someone that is important to you? They would love to share maybe a dad, mom ,grandparents they have tones of experience in the past. A person who has shared wisdom or experience with me would be my father ,because he has showed me how to be respectful to adults and show me how to work some business papers.

One thing that my father had shared with me is how to respect adults. For example, my father wasn't always the best child. He would do bad choices like going out with his friends all the time and not listen to this parents. But as he got older he realized no one though he was serious and rejected him. They thought he was trouble child, Soon when I was born ,and when i was able to talk and walk my. My father would make me say please and thank you. As well as listening to the adults, bow when entering a door and greeting them. My father did not want me to me like him when he was younger so he made sure I was respectful to my grandparents. This shows that my father gave me some experience to get respected into the family.

Another thing that my father has shared with me is how to work at a business. For instance for the past few months my father has showed me how to do paper work at his second job. My dad has to count the money that he was getting and how much to give back the workers. So a few times my dad would come into my room and teach me how to split the money they were making and pay the bills. Those days he showed me showed me how much money everything is ,and made me realized that I need to work very hard because if I want a simple job that I doesn't do much that gave a job that can pay my bills I need to work hard in school. This shows that my father really cares about my future and want me to do well in life and showed me some wisdom in of how hard like will be if i don't do well in school. In closing my father taught me how to do business and how to process one because I want to do business.

In conclusion a person who has showed me wisdom and experience would be my father by teaching me to respect adult and how to do paper work at his job. H+e had showed me by telling about his past and show how to mange a business when I am older. So what are some people that is important to you that has shared wisdom and experince?

CA7EF1C7C3FE,"It is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college. Some students want to graduate early than other students. There are some reassons that students have to graduate early. Some of the reassons are: they want to finish high school to earn money to go to college, to take some vacations to pass time with family, also if you are a Hispanic person, you're older, and you have resposabilities, you want to get a good job with a high school diploma, if you just want to gradute early, and if you are a great student with all that you need, you can graduate early. The students's graduation is basic in what they need and want.

Some students do hard work one year early to graduate from high school. For example, if a student is 16 years old, and the student is in eleven grade, the student do not have enough credits, or don't have what the student need to graduate, the student is not going to graduate from high school. But also there are students that they have all what they need to gradute and they can graduate early. A low percetage of students have a jod, resposabilities after school, or activities to do. Schools offer many activities that students can do after school, also students stay after school to retake quiz or get help from a teacher.

If a student need to graduate early for any reasson, the student need to work hard, and get all what the student need to gradute. Also the student have to do extra work. For example, if the student don't understand any subject, the student have to stay after school, and get help from a teacher to pass the subject and get the credits. One disadvantage that the student can have is that if the students have a job after school, the student can get tired from high school and his/her job. And the student can stop to do what the student need to gradute. The student have to make an effort to graduate early.

Some school offer programs that allow high school students to gradute in three years. Some of the programs are in summer, in the evening. Those programs help students to finish high school, it's a easy way to get credits in a short period time. The minimum of students are not able to be into theze type of programs. One of the reasson can be that the student work in summer.

If the students are not able to be in the programs, they have another opportunity, they can take courses online.

In conclusion it is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter to college, but have advantage and disadvantages. One advantage are that some school offers programs or students can take courses online, that can help students to graduate. One disadvantage is that, students can get tired, they to do hard work, if they want to gradute early. Students that want to graduate in three years and enter college, some students have a job after school to earn money to college. All depends in the student, if the student do all the work, the student is going to graduate but, if the student don't do the work, the student is not goin to graduate.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5
CA8DAD4BCC7A,"Should students graduate earlier from high school? Graduation earlier have been the choice that a lot of students on make on their lives. They may feel over-confident when they are clear about what are their accomplishments and the things that they have to do to reach it. It is not that easy as it sounds because they need to prepared themselves and notify that it will be difficult to reach their goals. However at the end they will see that was for a good and valuable things for their lives. They might will need to work hard and feel like to exceed themselves. It is good idea to graduate earlier because students will have the opportunity to find a job after they graduate and earn money then later they can start going college, they will be more productive in society, and they will develop their skills and knowledge.

Students that graduate earlier need to have enthusiasm and know that they will have a more difficult life and realize that they will have more responsibilities and duties in society, when they are out of school they should take that as an advantage to use their time wisely and help themselves by trying to find a job and earn some money; if they are taking the decision to go to college in few years. It is hard to find a job when the time pass and they did not practice all the things that they learn in the past and then realize that they should do sometime productive same as when they were in high school before they graduate.

In addition they will be helping their parents same as they did it when they were in school, by supporting and care about of them, they will be contributing in home and society. Also, they will have others accomplishments that they might want to reach it and celebrate with their families and make them feel proud and happy of their goals. Understanding that all the things that they did are for have good benefits and others people will used as good thing to defend or help themselves.

Finally, all students have the same capacity to show up and do the right things, after they graduate they have the opportunity to find a job and demonstrate how the develop their skills and knowledge. Staying positive and knowing that they can do great and specials things will make them feel proud of their works and then they will prove that they can do amazing things like everybody does. Providing high qualities of themselves in a workplace can help them to know and find new information about what things are happening in the world that round them.

Students should be thinking what they want do in their future or after high school since when they are growing up because that will help them to clear their minds and thoughts. Working hard and doing it with enthusiasm that is how they will be success in their future. Earning money by working honestly later that will be a big step to start a career in college, helping people and communities will make them feel more productive and helping their attitudes to stay confident, brave, and strong all the time with themselves,demonstrating their abilities and capacities is how they will be success in their futures lives.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
CAA2C4C4E79C,"Do you think first impressions are impossible to change? Some people say that first impressions are possible to change by getting more in detail. I agree that first impression are impossible to change because first impressions are negative and peoples thoughts don't change.

In other words, first impressions are usually negative. For example, if you see a person and he or she just has a serious face, your first impression ""that person has bad vibes''. Or a type of food that looks strange to you, you automatically start saying negative things about it.

Also, peoples thoughts never seem to really change you will always see that character or thing the same way. Why? Because nothing changes everything it remains if something does change ,it changes in negative way. As an example, people get more cruel or companies start inventing products that shouldn't be together. Your mind won't change unless that person ,place or thing changes in a positive way.

So, first impressions are almost impossible to change. First impressions can change by getting more involved and finding more information about that subject but, it is impossible to change that. In the futures lets hope this world and the people and objects in it will change in a postive way so our first impressions can be possible to change.

CB4C85EFAE67,"The author Waldo Emerson wrote a statement or quote that it say ,""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" basing on my point of view or experiences, I agree with him, I think the same, we will never grow if we keep doing the samething that we already mastered.

I'm taking this position on this issue becasue I have my reasos to sopport my position and to explain why this author is right.

First reason is on point of view if you're already mastered in something and you're keep doing it , to be better or go beyond then my opinion is that you're wasting your time on something unnesesary because you're already mastered , just be happy with what you have and knows a sample are the

Childrens they always wanna something if they have it they want more and more or when they are playing they wanna play possiblely the all day when they realize the day is already gone but they don't care because they think that they have enough time to play so it is the same with us. sometimes we wanna be betters than another people or just feel good but we're wasting our time in somethin that we already mastered.

Secondly the author Emerson show us the true in a quote we can stop doing something that we already mastered we could try to do something else or try to learn something new that can help us in the future of that way we can start growing because we start to learn about differents things so we have more knowledge and we can survive and we can realize or knows how the life looks like. A sample to be a boss you need to know or have more knowledge at least than yours employs or to be amanager you have to know many things.

Finally unless you try to do it better or be better than the rest of the people always is gonna be someone else who is better than you then that time you're wasting doing something beyond than you knows ,use it to teach someone else or learn about some else how to be better in something , teaching someone else or learning from someone else you can start to grow. A example is a old brother he learn about his parents and also teach and care his youngest brother of the way he is starting to growing up because his taking a responsability .The example can show us that we need to about experiences or advices or people who has more knowledge of that way .

In conclusion for these reason and supporting with examples that I wrote, I agree and think the same with The author Waldo Emerson , I took this position because If we try to do something beyond what we already mastered, we will never grow. Also we wasting our time and we could use that time to learn from someone something else what we do not know or teach to someone else about our knowledge . what we can help us to grow or be better in the future concluding I agree with Emerson's statement.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5

Sometimes its better to ask multiple people for in advice because everyone thinks differently and you will probably get more different advise from people because the more people you ask for in advise then you will get more advise from people. Sometimes its even better to ask someone for in advice that has had in experienced of something that you might not be experienced with like going through something rough people will understand you because the have also been like that or you just feel worry about something or because you are curious or interested about something and you want to know or want to try something new for the first time. Sometime people want advice when they need help because they can't make the right decision or probably because they are going through something rough in there life. Sometimes people need in advise to help them make a better choice sometimes people need advice to help to let them know in what they need to work on or improve on next time. When making a decision you need to think about will my decision effect others or myself? or does it benefits them or me? sometimes people need advise then they are making a decision because sometime when making decision it can be challenging. What does advice help people for advice can helps in many ways like to not give up in things people try not giving up so they use advice sometime people just need a motivation in advice that can also be inspirational to some people advice can be very inspirational and that can help them be success in the future sometimes people need advice to help them get motivated advise can be used in many ways sometimes you will probably not get the advice that you want from people but Seeking multiple opinion that can help them answer their question multiple opinion can help someone see the other person point of view and understand easily and know in what they need to improve on next time. ,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
CC8C5C963660,"A study found that 87% of students that participate in extracurricular activities become more involved at school. Extracurricular activities are fun you once you let yourself try something new. Most kids judge something before trying it, but if they try it might be worth it. Most people that do extracurricular have a more happier time in school because of its positive effects. I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can make new friends, become more productive, and finding a passion for something new.

One reason, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because you can make new friends. When I was kindergarten there was a healthy kids club and I was a shy kid at the time. So my parents thought it would be the best for me to join the club. I was very against but still went to the club. My neighbor joined the club too so we could be together at least. When my neighbor and I came to the first healthy kids club meeting, and we were separated into different groups. A teacher called my name to leave the room with a bunch of kids in my grade that I didn't know. After we got into the room people started talking and making new friends. This one girl named Generic_Name came up to me and we started talking. After becoming friends with her, the club wasn't that bad. Generic_Name and I started to sit by each other at lunch, and played together at recesses. We are still friends together to this very day. Another example is when my neighbor started to learn baseball. As he grew up no one else in the neighborhood knew how to play baseball. He always wished he had someone to play with. Once he got into middle school he heard they were having tryouts for the baseball team. So he decided to try out for the baseball team. He made the team. He started having more friends come over to his house. He even made friends in higher grades then him. He would always being playing baseball or out having fun with his new friends. I could tell he became a more happier person, and that he has now found people he can relate to and overall have fun with too. So this is why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because you can make new friends.

Furthermore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive. My cousin she decided to join volleyball team her freshman year. She thought it would be fun to join. She started to focus too much on volleyball. Her grades started slipping and she was told she couldn't play any volleyball games till her grades were up. She had to stay up late nights to complete extra work that would raise her grades. She thought to herself, if she went back to the volleyball team she would have to find a balance to make sure volleyball doesn't take over her whole life. She got her grades back on track and she was allowed to play in games again. She started getting used to her new schedule to balance volleyball, and school. My next example is when my uncle was in high school, he joined an after school club for mechanics. My uncle wasn't a very good child growing up. He was always skipping classes, and never show up to class. Soon he joined a mechanics club with his friends. He instantly fell in love with it. He started showing up for school, and teachers started to see him be more productive. He so after choose his job as a mechanic, and he started to save money to have his own mechanic shop. He soon went to college to learn more about mechanics. He started working in a mechanic shop to learn the experiences of working and owning a shop. He then started his own successful company. Without extracurricular to change his attitude about school, he wouldn't be where he is today. These are a few reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive.

Therefore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new. When I first joined band I didn't know what instrument I would be playing. I started to play the saxophone and became good at it. Once I started to show my teacher, he offered to put me in honor band and that I would need to stay after school to join it. I started to get new songs for honor band that challenged me. I knew when I grew up I wanted to play saxophone. I'm in middle school and I couldn't get into band this year due to my honor classes. This year I have missed playing the saxophone because its my passion. I have decided next year to do less honor classes to see if I can get back into band and get to do my passion again. My second example is about my closest cousin. She joined her after school baking classes. She started baking cakes for family events and special occasions. She finally found out when she was older she wanted to become a baker. She is now working in at a bakery nearby my house. She is always baking and learning new techniques to improve her baking skills. This year she will be graduating high school early and going to culinary school. She never knew what her passion was going to be and without extracurricular she would have never known. These are my reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new.

Students making new friends, people become more productive, and find a passion for something new are reasons why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activities. Without trying extracurricular people might never know the importance of trying something new. Overall this is why I believe extracurricular can change your life.            ",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5
CC9E2835EFAF,"We as a specie have lived as long as we have because we learned how to stay as one and to distribute the work.

We have come far from those days, we build structures withe intricate designs, we build ways to cross oceans in no time at all. I still wonder if a single individual would been able to do it . That is why team work is important.

When you are acing to a team it is because you poses a ability or skill that benefits you. As a example you work on a company that creates websites for government projects, you poses a degree on couding and in graphic design. You have been employ as a content creator, you can see it this way you are a cog Pict meticulously to fit in a larger machine. One that runs at a constant pace, it dose not deviate or exert pressure on to the parts that compose it.

Second when you work in a team the work loud is divide in to the right proportion. In a construction crew you will always find that the cement worker will away divide the cement in to portions, this is to prevent over use of cement. In a team you will receive the amount you can handel to prevent that someone is overwork. Like when you go to a kitchen you will see that one is piling the carrots,a other one is preparing the cake mix, a other the toppings. Everyone has a task to complete

CCEFC4392340,"Most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators think that summer break is too long and students do not retain information as easily as they would in the fall. Because of this a lot of educators think we should have year- round school years. This would be shorter breaks in the summer (3-4 weeks) and longer more spread-out breaks throughout the year. I disagree with this statement and believe that summer break should stay the way it is.

The first reason I disagree with this statement is that it would ruin certain summer activities or even business plans. Think about all the activities in the summer that kids usually take part in, this could be sports, some sort of trip, etc. All of these activities students would preferably do during summer break. They have this preference because they see the summer as a perfect time to do all these activities without having to balance their education as well. They can put most of their time on this activity. The same preference applies to things like summer jobs or internships. During the summer they can learn important values like how to save and earn money. Or if a certain student has a chosen career path they can explore this career path by going in a internship for that spesicifc job. For all of these activities students at the very least would be discouraged to participate in if there was a year-round school year.

The second and probably most important reason is pertaining to the students mental health. An article, by Complex News writing about kids mental health stated, that over 40% of kids by the end of their freshmen year in high school are depressed or overall feel exhausted and depleted mentally. The article continues to say that this number from the time of their freshmen year only increases after each school year. Students use the summer break as a way for their brain to refresh from the long almost ten month school year. Students need this time to relax their brain and get ready for the next year of education. As a student, I can say that during school my brain goes into this state where I am mostly just focused on school work. And I can admit that my brain at multiple points during the year is worn down and damaged by always be in this state. My brain does not get a chance to heal from this until the summer, when school is over. So if we were to hypothetically have a year-round school year, this would mean that the brain would also be in this damaged state year round. If this were the case than the brain of the student would eventually just break and shut down. No student should have to experience that because of a year- round school year.

Although the strongest reason for this year-round school year is that students cannot properly retain enough information for the next school year, I think I have a much stronger counter claim and solution to this problem. A very simple way to take care of the problem of retaining information, is to make mandatory (but simple) assignments from the previous year for the student to complete so that they don't forget this information. This way students can have their long summer break to refresh their brain and do their activities, without them having to forget any information. You get the best of both worlds with no need for a year-round school year.

In conclusion I think my assertions for the summer break to stay the way it is is much stronger than year-round school year argument. Having a year-round school year would be unnecessarily tedious and dangerous as it would negatively affect summer activities and mental health. As someone said once upon a time ""Don't fix it if it ain't broke.""",5.0,4.5,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

Some will said you'll grow but won't reach their beyond what they mastered. Some will disagree with Ralph Waldo Emerson statement, because doing something beyond that already master will never stop you from doing it. In the pass year I played a Villain before I reach goal becoming beyond with a instrument that I didn't know how to play, I master how to soccer for the first when I was little, and at the end of the day your going to be beyond great when you don't give up.

When I was 6th grade in middle school I never though I was going to learn how to play instrument for the first time in my life. The instrument that I'm now play is Villain my brother though I wasn't good enough to play a instrument. I practice every days to get better and to try my best. I played three year in middle school I was getting good and then I love how sound made with bows and string. The teacher once said if stop playing then your going to forget the string note and how to used correctly. When I got to middle I learned how to play a interment for the for time in my life become beyond. I didn't stop growing I kept growing to become better to play.

Why won't we reach our goal then become beyond because doing something beyond your reaching a goal to finish. This was a time where I want to learn how to play a sport. When I was little I wanted to play soccer but I didn't started learning until I was 10 years old. My goal was to learn how to play soccer, until one day I was at the park with my family and friend I learn how to play soccer. My uncle tough me how to played soccer for the first time.

He showed me how to kick the inside and outside of my feet. My uncle told me that I was fast learner that I kicked correctly with forced. So we played soccer just kicking back and forth until knew how to kick. When I was 7th grade I sign up for the girl soccer team for the school. When I made the team I was exacted because I never though I going play for school soccer team and it was the first to play. The couch liked how I played but my friend though I was beyond great but I didn't believe them. When I got to 8th grade I wanted to sign up again because some of my friend was joining, then when I made in the team next then I know they voted for me to become captain for the girl soccer team. The coach was beyond how I played for the game I made 8 goal in the season but I never stopped playing soccer. Until the moment in my life I knew that I had master my goal.

I'm 16 year old about to turn seventeen in July I have reach so many goals in my life and then it when beyond. I learn so many thing on my own because my parent didn't know English. At the end of day I had teacher and friends that help me all my school year. The one key that my parent tough me was never give up on yourself, if you don't understand the problem then go to the next problem then come back to finish the rest. So all this year I learn how to play a instrument that was a villain and playing a sport that love I become beyond great and master to become better. I grew up become better the thing I love the most and did it because I had sibling following my foot step since I was the oldest in my family.",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5
CD47F64F2398,"The benefits of working with a group and why you should find a group to complete your assignment isn ted of doing it alone.

It's really beneficial to be with a group because of everyone collaborating. Working with a group makes the assignments to be completed in a easier and a faster way. Having a lot of people in a group means that everyone is going to be sharing their thought and ideas of how to complete the work in a easiest way. Working alone means that you have to work harder more responsibilities and also it will take you much more time to complete your assignments sense you are doing everything by yourself.

Being with a group allows others to collaborate with each other that means that no matter how hard the assignments are all together are going to be able to complete it. Having a group guarantee you less responsibilities as well because you have others whom can do a different task from what you are doing. Also being with a group guarantee you to complete the work in much less time that if you were to do it alone. A group gives you better understanding of what you all have to complete do to everyone strong thought and ideas.

Something really important in a group is the Lieder someone who is responsible to check if everyone in a groups is done with their assigned task. Also having a lieder will be easy to assign each one a task without everyone complaining about doing the work. You can also contact you lieder to inform him that is going to be impossible for you to complete your assigned task do to a problem with your family so that way a lieder can inform the others and find someone who can take you task and finish it, if you were alone you would not be able to complete that sense you wouldn't have anyone to depend on. A group guarantee you success when it became to complete any assignments do to everyone effort and sharing ideas, sure a lieder might be important but with a a group the lieder is nothing so everyone is really need in a group in order to successfully complete the work.

Sometimes in life to succeed , you have to be passioned.

If you are passioned, you will be better at everything that you do, also, we have to be passioned to look for new stuff that you will like to know more about and learn about it.

If you want to grow in life , you can't be scared,

sometimes for being scared of learning or asking a question, we miss big opportunities and stay stuck, also, dont be scared of what other people think about you.

Other people might say that if you are good in life right now , why would you want to learn something new?, and you have tell them that you want succeed in life,be better person, not like the average people that dont do nothing to be better in life.

Many times to grow and succeed in life, we have to try new things, we cant be stuck in the same thing for our whole entire life. The statement that Ralph waldo Emerson wrote, is very true and i agree with him, if we dont try new stuff , we wont grow in life. we have to be more passioned of our life and start looking for new stuff to learn, and stop being scared of learning because we are missing big opportunities.",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5
CE7E3C75BAF8,"This statement says that ""first impressions are almost impossible to change."" I disagree with this statement because it is possible to change anyone impressions. Like if they are having a bad day and someone walks up to that person and does something to make them feel a little better. They can also do that to other people by making new friends and making their day better. By getting positive with them they would feel a little bit happier around you and people.

It can impact on how that person day changes from bad to good. Knowing that is helps that person out a lot by having a good mood now. It can change other people mood as well. They can share the positively to other people making sure that they feel alright. By doing that they can share with there family as well.

Getting other people happy will make you even more happy by how you were showing other people. It doesn't have to be random people it can be your boyfriend/girlfriend. By doing that you can meet a lot of new people in life that can make you happy. It can bless you by other things in the world. Other people can make you feel better by sitting next to you if your alone and talk.

By showing being happy they could be friends and get well with each other. Also if they are gonna be friends they can show each other positive mood if they are feeling down. Having those types of friends would be nice to have around with you that make you laugh and smile. The attitude that they give you could change as well by how they talk to you. If they talk to you aggressive then it would change your mood.

Making sure you have the right people to have in your life is important beacuse you don't want to feel down all the time and if won't make you feel sad.",3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0
CE98C42F51C2,"In my opinion I think the kid's that don't listen to there mom and dad. then They need this program the most. One the older student this telling the younger student what to do. And the older student is acting like there parents. Then if they do the program for like 3 or more time a week then,the younger student will get use to it. And the they will maybe listen to there mom and dad.

How is this program going to help them later on when they have kid's. This is for the older one one. Because he or she is telling younger kids what to do and it pretty much just getting ready when they have kid's later on. And it also teaching they how to respect there orders.

this program is going to help both younger kids and older kids because... Then a older person tells you to something. you should do it. its called respect your orders. Like if u respect other people it dont matter how old you are. You just have to respect older people. And one more time it's just going to prepare the older students when they have kid's. And younger kids how to behave in fort of there parents.

CEF302996231,"Dear Dr. Generic_Name,

Thank you for taking time out of your day to read my letter, hope you and your staff are doing well. My name is Generic_Name and I'm currently a Junior at Generic_School. I believe that some students should benefit from taking online classes because we won't have to worry about turning in papers late, or having to hearing teachers to put our phones and headphones away, and also I won't worry about owing school lunch money. Online classes is a should and it can also be a shouldn't, and i will explain why its a should.

In school we all panic when we hear a due date, especially when its up close. Students work better at their pace than rather to wait on the teacher, teachers go slow just for the other students get to know what's going on. When taking tests, or quizzes, we seemed to get rush because we only have that class for and hour and some change. In some cases if we don't finish on time they, will ask us to stay after school. Some of our parents work late nights and won't be able to get a ride back home. Also in school we all get distracted so easily, like from fights that happen in school, drama, and class clowns that are not really doing their work. And kids need to concentrate in their work instead of lacking off.

At Generic_School, phones and headphones are a huge problem. Some of us like to listen to music and work better with it, but however, some teachers don't always allow it in the classroom. Classes at home can be such a big change in a good way, we won't get in trouble if we get found using our phones or even listening to music. A lot of teachers find this disturbing and run to writing us up, but they won't understand how much faster your brain functions when listening to music, it gets you more concentrated into your own work.

Our parents work and the school thinks that they make lots of money, due to that cause the school charges us for the food we eat. In some cases we get milk that's been expired, and they dont even notice it. Classes that we can take at home could benefit us here, we have better food at home and wont worry about if the food that we get at school is expired or not. Online classes can be much cheaper than to actually go to school. At home, we can eat breakfast and lunch and not think about that eating breakfast or too early or if eating lunch is too late.

Thank you once again for reading my thoughts, I strongly agree that our students should benefit from taking online classes while being at home.

Sincerely,

CF45352F8424,"Do you think positive attitude is a key that everyone need in order to be a successful person in life? In my essay I will talk about positive attitude, if it is important or not. In my opinion attitude should be always positive, because it can help you to succeed in work, can encourage people to do their best, even if what they have to do is hard to do it, and it can be a great tool in order to succeed in relationships, and believed in yourself.

When I was working in Mango Paradise, my boss was a really bitter person, that was always angry with everyone in the work, but I was one person that I didn't care about his bad attitude toward us, I was always with a big smile, perhap how he treated us. There was one day that he had a bad day, because one member of his family was in the hospital, and was very delicate, he was an a mood that did not look like he was the same one, he was sad, he was devastated, and worried, because the person that was in the hospital was his wife, she had cancer. So, that same day I asked him if we may talk, he said "" Yes"", I just wanted to talk with him and tell him that perhap everything, we were there to support him in everything he needed. Unfortunate, his wife pass away, and as I said to him, we were there all the time supporting him, we were there with a positive attitude telling him, that everything will be okay, that his wife is gonna be in a better place where can rest in peace, where she will not suffer more. He was so thankful with us because how we supported him in that bad moments that wanted to increase our salary, many of us accepted, but many others not. He really change since that days, that many of us, we are still working there, and earning more money than we regurlarly earned.

In every human life, there is always a hard problem, that make us to give up, but there is also a person with a positive attitude that makes us to get up, and continue with our life. There was a time in my family where we had a problem of money, my father got fired on his work, we almost lose the house where we were living, because we did not paid the rent in almost four months. My father was devastated, he was looking for a job amost for three months, and he could not find any job to pay the rent, so we would not lose the house. As every wife do, my mom came to him and said ""Do not worry sweetheart, we can get out of this problem as we always do, I am here to support you"". My father almost immediately changed his attitude, he gave to my mom a big smile and said to her "" Thanks babe to be always with me, and for trust on me"", he get up take the keys of the car, and went out to look for another job. He found a new job where he earn a little bit more than his previous job, so our money's problem disappear.

Believe in yourself not always is easy, some times we though that is difficult to understand yourself, but there is always a lovely person that help you to believed in how strong you are, and to see all the thing that you are capable to do. When I was in 10 grade, I had an algebra teacher that was always telling us that we had to believed more in ourselves, sometimes we did not do what she asked us to do, because we did not understand, many of us were disappointed of ourselves, because we didn't even try to do it. In the first quater many of us in our class period failed. We though that our score would never change. After that many student changed their attitude, but it was not because we wanted. It was because our teacher talked with us, and made us to believe that we can do anything that we want to do. Some time later many of us had changed, as we changed, we saw that our teacher changed too. The second quater passed, and the students were happy because their score in the algebra class, many students's score were from 50 to 90, it happened because all us changed our attitude in different manners. We paid more attention as we should since the beginning of the year, we started to believe in us, we started to do things even if we didn't know how to do it. Until this moment I am thankful with my teacher, because of her, we changed to a better score, because of her we believe more in ourselves, she just wanted our best, but sometimes we made her get angry, because we did not believed in ourselves. We changed, all of us did, and she became for me the most good person as a teacher and as a friend, she was always supporting us, and teaching us. That is why until this moment she is one of my favorite teacher, and I think that for my other classmates she is too. For that experience that I had, I think that possitive attitude is something extremely important in every human life.

Our attitude has to be always positive, even in the worst moment of our life.

Some people think that a person should have a positive attitude just during a very important moment, or in happy moments, this is not correct, they all are wrong, we need to have a possitive attitude always in order to succeed in life, and to be happy. In our homes old people as grandmother, grandfather, sibblings and parents, need to give the example, so kids will take it, and they will be confident and a positive person.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5

D06951B19A28,"Most people believe that working in a group is more beneficial than working alone. Other people think otherwise, they say that working alone is more beneficial than working in a group. People is different, they have different believes and ways to work.

Some people prefer working in a group for many reasons. One of that reasons is that people in a group get more things done in less time. They say that is better working with more people because when you work alone you get bored or you don't get motivated as the people that works in groups. Working in a group is better because people can share their ideas with the other people in the group and they can do a very good work using all those ideas. Also, the work can be divided in equal parts, and that's fair, in that way everybody have the same amount of work to do.

Some people think otherwise, they prefer working alone for many reasons. First, it is a little bit boring because they don't have nobody to talk and to share their ideas but they know what they are going to work with. They can do their work in their own way, they can take all the time they want to do the work. Second, they do not have to wait for people to tell them what to do or to ask if the work that they did is correct. Third, people can edit their work many times without asking other people what they think about it. Another reason is that people does not have other people rushing them. And sometimes people that work in groups have a lot of issues because they do not agree with other people work, and a lot of times the grade that they got for that work is the same for every group member. That means that if somebody made a mistake every group member will be affected because of that.

In conclusion, working alone is more beneficial because of a lot of reasons. Every person have their own way to work but if you work alone you are not allowed to get in issues, arguments, problems and bad grades.  ",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0
D06EDF336392,"A city council is debating for the adoption of the curfew for teenagers. That create an enormous positives and negatives reactions the rabble who is for the curfew and who disagree this and said we are in a free country. This laws prohibit to see a teenager on the street at 10 P.M weekday and midnight weekend. In this prompt we will show the reason why the curfew can be a marvelous benefit for teenagers and keep them out of trouble.

In beginning, the decision is reassuring for the parents. For example, when the parents know where their children are that can help them to stay calm. Because sometime we have a parent suffering from high blood pressure and don't know where their children are can affect them. In this case, parents are the main piece of the education of children. When the parent stay at home with their children that can help them to planning the schedule of the sleeping period to be the optimal version of parent of their children. If this case, parents can have a few control into the life of their children. the idea there is to leave a parent with their children to help them to be close and to know each other. Because we have a french proverb what said ""Tell me who do you walking with and I will tell you who are you?"" And the best people for approve your friend and answers us the fabulous question ""Who are you?"" Is our parents.

Furthermore, this law would reduce work of 911. Because everyone know that most of the crime are commit at night and that can not be the moment where we leave our teenagers outside. For example that will help the 911 to reduce call for emergency at night. Because we never know what can happen in a teenagers party, they can do a prank call challenge, they can have a fire in party, or they can fight. In other case, the law can heaven preserve them from eventual aggression in the minor. We do not know who the people who walk in our street and their mentality. We have immensity and variety of people in our street like drugs dealer, a daring, and a rabble we do not go to let our children walking in this environment at night. In this case, the law can decrease a criminality rate in the street. Because teenager are the principal target of people in the street because they are easily influenced. This easily influenced can associate them with a sort of people disreputable.

In auditioning, the curfew can help a teenagers in their education. that can help teenager to study. Because the first priority of a teenager is school and they can have time for studying, that decision can create the future amazing men and women in the future for emergence of our city. In this case, that can help teenagers to sleep early. To have a fantastic performance in everything we doing, we need to have our eight hours of sleeping that is also the case of school. To have a marvelous performance at test and at class we need to sleep the time recommend by a specialist. In this case, teenagers can learn to be organize and responsible. Because the curfew can sharpen their sense of priority what is actually to back home before 10 P.M. And this sense of priority can help them to be a wonderful adult.

Finally,to sum up the situation, we saying our vision about the beneficial effect of the curfew in our marvelous city. The beneficial effect what can impact our the families situations, the local authority, the society and in school, or class. That rule can be very strict for some people, but that is after a long analyze the best way to put our teenagers safe. The curfew can assure the best future for the children in our city and

Kindness is the key for success and enjoying your life. The world would not been the same if their were not any kindness, imagine what it would be like if no one knew what kindness is. Having kindness in your blood could change your future to an even better one. Having no kindness means that you are negative and misrable but all that could change when a person shows you how kindness could change your personality.

When people see you showing kindness, that shows that you have a good heart and a good soul. And, it also shows that you care and very nice so, people could trust you. Thinking kindness is very positive and relaxing because it is a very good thing to do in life. Kindness will never be a bad thing because it is meant to change the future. No matter what, kindness could never go wrong as long as you try it to others.

Spreading kindness around the world could change how people think, in terms of doing something bad is not part of kindness. Therefore, giving kindness to a person could spread around the world, and you would not even know that all this kindness was because of you. Without kindness, all the virture words would not even exsist. There would be no such things as being caring, loving, sharing, humble, and so much more. Every small kindness you show to others, will change their emotion and follow your action as they did to you.

Kindness will really help you in the future because it shows you who you truly are. If you show kindness everywhere then their could be a chance for you to get into jobs easily or, for you to get good grades on your school work. Also, in the future you would be very grateful that kindness brought you here into this amazing life, and all the kindness you have done in your previous years. Kindness is always by your side. You will appreciate having kindness in your life because it helps you to become a better person.

D175411080CC,"Many students become involved in extracurricular activities to enrich their educational experiences, and some even become involved in so many activities that they have little time to study or complete homework assignments. Schools should limit on how much extracurricular activities they can do, having too much will cause confusion among students in class and too much is always not good. having their families decide for them is an option, but the best decision should be for the school, for they know how well the student is doing.

Research from age between 21 to 26 shows that 95% of them wanted to decide for their children,They wanted the best for them and the best they will do, That is the job of the parents. A blog back in 2006 shows that people who decides for their children most likely to get a job than people who decide on their own.

A Research conducted back in 2010 shows that 80% of people prefer to decide for themselves, having them to decide will greatly benefit their mind and shows that they are responsible on how they act. They like to choose their own path and find their own talent. Finding their own talent shows responsibility, and having responsibilities at a young age takes courage, dedication, and hard work.

Having too many activities will also cause a lot of their energy to get drained, they won't have any energy to spare for other activities like cooking for dinner, or doing assignments. The school should keep track on every students activities, This ensure their safety and heath. Having every energy drained from your body is bad, and the school should keep track at their time as well. Having more energy will greatly benefit their health. The school is partly responsible for the students, but the parents are most responsible and should know what their children's are doing, if they think their doing too much, they should talk to them and have a simple chat about overworking.

The school can also add a one simple rule where people who has 3 activities or more should be given time at the end of each classes 15 to 30 minutes free time to discuss with their teacher on how well they are doing and to do missing work or assignments. In Generic_City, Philippines, University of Mang Totomas, Practice this method. Research from this school shows that students have increased their grades when they added this rule back in 1996, it increased from the average of 3.0 GPA to 4.1 GPA, This huge increase show's that adding this simple rule will benefit not only the students health, but their grades as well.

I think the city council should adopted the curfew for teenagers because it'll keep them out of trouble. They're some teenagers who will stay outside to trouble the people. It's a good idea for some teenagers to go home at 10 P.M because they are on the street leasoner to muise, and doing nothing but to trouble athers. Will there some teenagers who is stuly for schools, and trying to sleep becuase they are going to schools. If the curfew is adopted, they should make a law that saying teenagers who is out on streets after 10 P.M would be breaking the law.

Most of the teen are jail because they are doing things they should not do. Some of them have gam but most of them not ever 18 to have a gam with them. Some of them is on jail for no reasons but they well find with teen who had gam, and other sutf with them.

The technology makes our work easy. It helps you to save our time. Technology also help us to run a lot of businesses .But on the other hand most of the peoples do the missuse of technology and use it in different ways for example robbery,hacking,and the murders of different peoples. It also effect's a lot on our new generation by inventing and by adding a bunch of vedio games in their computer or their phones.

In past if you wants to read the book and to write a book for reading you have to go to the library and find the book and read it or if you wants to write a book you have to collect a bunch of papers and ink and it takes a lot of time to do it but,now because of the technology we are able to access every book online and we also able to write a book on the computer that saves our money to buy the papers and ink. It also saves our time.

In Businesses the technology is really important because of this we are able to handle our money because the technology shows us in business that how much profit we get and how much we spend on the stocks and how much we spend to buy our products and also you can get your money in the form of direct deposits so quickly .We don't have to wait a couple of month's to get our money.

So, the missuse of technology is also one of the big reason. The hackers hacks the different websites and crash their important data or sometime's they enter into the websites of bank's and transfer their money to a different account. Most of the peoples use the technology for robery or murders. They follow the person for the couple of days and check their every history that what time he's in his home or what time he's out from his home. So when they see's that nobody is at home. They go and do the robbey.

Most of the teenagers and childern's do a lot of missuse of technology. They spent teir lot of times in watching movies or playing the vedio games of differnt types or kind. The rays that come from either our computer or our mobile might also effect eyes sometimes really badely.

So in real if we have the advantages of technology we also have the dissadvantages of technology. Because every thing have opposite side. So,we are not able to do anything with the disadvantages but we are able to overcome the disadvantages.

If there is no technology the world might be nothing. No body knows each other from a long distance. We still have a rular system on us.

How nice people are to them .

First, Being stuck in the house isnt fun because you won't meet new people or reconnect with people from your old school or meet the love of your life .Things like this is what makes people kill their self because they dont have fun. They also meet people online and let what the people online think of them. that effects a lot of peoples lives.

Then, teens would be on video games all day rather than go out and do something active. That will increase oversize teens and adults in America. Technology can take over someones life they can be hooked to it. That its self harms the brain all types of ways.

Although, people are getting there things done without having to go and talk to other people. They can lose a lot of vitamin D. That can cause to death and in that way we would have a lot of deaths. and our population will decrease because of technology.

Homework clubs can be useful for kids that can't do there homework at home because they do not have WIFI.

Kids can stay after school and be in the homework club if they do not have computers at home to do essays.

Homework clubs can also help you get better in a subject like math because you can get more 1 on 1 help with a tutor.

Homework clubs can also be used for kids who are in a sport or after school activity the homework club would let you get your homework done quicker in school so that you can go to your after school activity on time.

For example if a kid has an F in math and a teacher gives him extra credit work to do and the kid doesnt understand the work the homework club with be there with tutors to help the kid understand and finish his work.

I believe that homework clubs would be a great way for kids to learn more about the subject they are studying in class.

Sometime dont you feel like your teacher is explaining something too fast and you dont really understand,Well the homework club can help you with that the homework club will get you a tutor to explain to you more about the subject.

Have you ever been in class and kids are talking well in the homework club you would have peace and quite so that you could do your work in peace.

Have you ever had that one class you couldn't pass well I have,so what i did was go to the homework club were i had teachers and other fellow students helping or teaching me what i didnt know about the subject i was struggling in.

The homework club is also a great way to interact with other student.

The homework club is a place for learning not for fooling around so if you want to join the homework club it is because you need help with your homework or classwork.

Anyone needing help is math science or in any subject should join the homework club.

The homework club can help you raise your grade in the class if you try hard and try your best.

The home work club is there if you want to get your homework done is school so that when you get home you can relax.

The homework club also has lots of benefits because you can learn more than other kids and you can get special attention from your tutors so that you can learn more in class.

In conclusion the reason why I want to create a homework club is to help kids that need extra help in class.

I also want to help kids who can't do there homework at home because they have no WIFI.

I would like to help kid who teacher aren't really teaching good so they can have a good grade in that class.

I would like to help kids that need special attention to learn.

These are all the reasons I think schools should have homework clubs.

Purchasing online things are not always great. When you do purchase it online sometimes they don't always tell the truth and when your getting phones or other things like clothes or makeup. These thing you never know if its used or brokering and if someone could of warn it too. Also food that are buy online are not fresh and they could Carey germs. Take for example when you go out you look at the food to see, which one is good and which one is bad but when your online you can't tell what your getting. This cause people to become lazy.

People become lazy because of how much stuff there is on online and games,

TV shows. Therefore people rather watch a TV show then go out with there family. This is bad for people because this can cause people to become depressed,more stress about online chats and what there saying online or watching a TV show;but you wish you could be that person. People will stop going outside. Take for example YouTube, YouTube is the most used media but also there are non-stopped videos they can go on forever and people stared to thing they have to many things to do. This cause peoples communicant with others harder. YouTube cause people to give up.

Communicating is becoming harder for people because they don't face to face talk anymore. Now they use phones more. Phones are used for texts ,calling. So why is communicant important? Communicant is the main thing in your life it brings people together and you need it for jobs. Jobs where you have to work with other people and help people that buy from you. Take for example Generic_Name is the co work and Generic_Name is the costumer,Generic_Name does't talk to people that much because she texts more ,therefore, when Generic_Name came up to her ask for help. She didn't help because she doesnt like talking to people.

Therefore,technology has limitation human contact with other people is a negative effect on our lives. I believe these are the reason,they buy things online that are not good and they start to become lazy,communicant becomes hard for people. Peoples need to use less technology and try to open there self to the outside world and hang with there friends and family or read books. Some will still choose to use technology today.",2.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,2.0,3.0
D38A414FA051,"Many believe that having a positive attitude is the key to success in life. Carrying a positive attitude can get you far in life. Job opportunities and getting notice by important people are opportunities that come with having an affirmative attitude. This kind of posture can benefit ones future.

If more individuals convey a positive attitude many would have better employment opportunities. Jobs can help you be successful. Working for the president of the United States is a more beneficial job then working a regular nine to five. Showing an affirmative attitude can help you work for the president and can also help you have a better income which can lead to success. Having a good occupation is important.

Since it's important to have a positive image it can expand the people you meet. One way is by having a confident posture. This helps you have a better chance of engaging with significant people like the president. This attitude can lead one to have job opportunities.

Looking at the other side being negative can also help you be successful in life. One example is by being selfish. Putting yourself first in everything you do can lead to success. With this negative image shows that your the most important person that can only bring you a favorable outcome.

As many have stated displaying confidence is the way to go in life. Employment opportunities and getting noticed by important individuals can bring success. With most success theres always positive results. Obviously one should always be positive if they want a desirable outcome in life because life is too short to be unsuccessful and negative.

people can be convinced by looking at other people`s example because they think that doing what others do is better.

In my opinion we should give more than one example to the people because one can not be enough for people who do not believe what other say, so what we need is more options where they can find their influences. Giving more than one option is giving them a chance to choose them what they can be influence by.

some times we need their attention because that way we can convinced them that we are telling them the true and they will follow us and they will fell comfortable with them self.

D42B6354404D,"Dear Principal

I think we students should at least have a B average to play sports, that would make it fair for who tries their best in school, but i bet that those who really love sports would try their best in all their classes. Students who do not try their be st and don't like sports they could just stay with whatever grade they get because they deserve it. Students who also have a bad attitude should not get to play either. If students really want to play sports or join activities they would really try hard not to be bad. If students have a 69 or below they should not let them play sports until they have a passing grade.

If many of the students have a C average they should try harder on their work for those who love sports and who like to join activities. I bet students who have a C average are mad because they cant play sports until they get a C average. I would like to convince the principal that they should at least get a B average. All students have to do is listen in class and pass all the test that teachers give out so you could pass the class and be able to pass your class and you'll be able to play what ever sport you want.

Students and people who try their best will always get everything they want because they do everything said and everything they tell them to do. doing everything they ask you to do will make you a good person. If you try your best you will get to play sports and join in activities you like. Your decision depends on you if you make a good decision you will get what you want if you don't you don't get everything that you want.

People should make their own decisions because if you trust your decision there is no reason why you should ask someone else. Putting some trust on your decision can help you do what is right or wrong. However, part of your decision needs to come from your heart.

Firstly, If you want to accomplish a dream in your life you need to put some extra work trying to get it done. Also, getting it done is not going to be easy but sometimes you need to try. For example, lets say you are a soccer player and you have a game but you don't trust your team mates what is going to happen is that you might lose that game. I know is hard to trust someone who doesn't act or look the same as you. I would take my decision and ask my self should I trust them or not?

Secondly, trusting your team will not always be the same but you should follow your instincts. Example, one day I made a bad decision of not cleaning the back yard of my house for like three months and it was fall and what happened was that it got full of leaves. If you take wrong decisions will cause you things that you don't want. When I saw my back yard full of leaves I ask to myself why did I make the decision of not cleaning the back yard. Ideas are part of what you should take seriously in your life. The idea of going to school should be one of the most important things you should do.

Thirdly, asking for help in taking a decision is not a bad idea. However, every day or every time you want to ask someone for help you must know who you are asking. For example, if you want to ask someone what you should do after graduation must come from you but sometimes you can ask questions to your family and talk about it, they might know what is the right thing you should do.

People agree with you taking your own decisions than doing what other says. Other unknown person's decision is what you should never do in your personal life. What I do when I have to take a decision of doing something is to think the decision twice.

In conclusion, never give up a decision of you doing the right thing. Always do what your parents says or ask you to do because they are the ones who wants you to accomplish your dreams, be there when they need you, talk to them when you need to. Other people who you should talk to are your siblings.                                                                  ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0
D58980F5EC66,"I believe this would benefit students around the world, students would be able to attend classes from any school no matter where students live, this would help students who live far way from school and can't get a ride to school. Attending classes online from home would make it more comfortable for students.

Distance learning is good thing for students that want to study in school around the world or get the best education, students can be at home taking some classes that their country does not offer. Let's say a student lives in France and the student takes classes from United States, that's a good benefit, because you are learning education from another country in a different way that your country teaches you. This will be good for students who live in different country temporarily and are coming back to their countries.

The schools that offer distance learning are making life easier for some students who can't get education of they have to walk for hours to go to school. I remember watching a video about girl's life where she explains how far she has to walk though the mountains for 4 hours just to get to school. There are students who can't get education, because of the places they live, like places that are cold or far way from the city. This a good benefit in the United States since there's is a virus called corona virus in some states people are already effect with it, schools are closing cause of that students will be talking classes at home.

In school some students feel uncomfortable of working with their teachers or classmates, that makes students to stop working or lose interest on their work, but when they are home school students feel more comfortable, because they are at their house with their family, they feel more safe at their house and they can trust their family. In schools one of the main reasons why students feel uncomfortable of going to class is because some students get bully by their classmates, others get peer pressure to try to do things they don't like or be something they are not, making students not to be themselves. There was this famous video of a kid who was crying and told his mom that he wanted a knife to kill himself, he was just 7 years old, the reason why he wanted to kill himself is because many people at his school make fun him for being small, the students at his school were bullying him so much that he had to be home school and get therapist to help him get better and be comfortable.

At the end being able to attend classes at home depends if the students like it not everyone would think this is a good benefit for students others would think that is bad for students to take classes at home, because students will not get the chance to be social with other, this will make students not be able to work or talk with others outside in person, because they spent so much time at their houses taking classes by themselves. I have friend who used to be home school, now he goes to a high school and because he was home school, he doesn't talk that much in school, he doesn't have that many friends, it takes a while to get to know him. Taking classes from home is only good benefit if you want to take classes from another school, can't go to school because of where you live or it takes too long to walk to school, and if you don't feel comfortable in school, those are the main reasons students would taking classes from home.

Some may say that people won't take things serious and just not even pay attention to it and see what the partnerships have too offer but, however it could help a lot of students who need too decide on what career they wanna do in life, so they wont be wasting time and money on a career that they dont even wanna pursue but, not also that people could get a head start on everyone who hasn't made up their minds.

Also for an example a companies like Google could offer a internship for cyber security. And if they see that certain people are putting in work and are making a change in the work environment or even helping out a good amount in the work space. They will for sure end up giving you a job you like, but not only that many companies have really good benefits so thats always a great plus. It also comes down to what people wanna do in life and how they are willing to pursue it.

then school is really expensive and time consuming. For example schools can cost up too $100,000 , and no average Joe has that kind of money just laying around so that when people have to get loans from banks ,but then end up owning the bank money and not only are people going to school you need to go work so people can pay for school, food, rent ,car payments and clothing. So then people end up living check by check and therefore people have no time for their families because they are so busy working on themselves.

finally it just comes down to what people wanna do in life and what benefits them in the long run so they can be stable with money and mentally. and also if they would like to do these programs that schools have too offer and what works for them, but they also gotta choose what they wanna do and actually like it because at the end of the day its their life.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

Firsly,Student should work during school at a young age because students need save money for college payment. All the students have dream to studey in a collage and become someone in future. some families have poor economy, they can't pay for collage of their child and they are earnings that much to eat and make a living like pay insurence and simething like that. For example my friend Generic_Name she is 11 grade. she is working in patrakandy mall as a cushier, so she doce't have father and just her mother, her letter brother is with her. she is working and saving the money for her collage.

Secondly, this help students to acuaintance with work environment. The more students working the more they are getting smarter and understand about the job. Students will become a enterpreneur in future, and get familier with different people in community. For example to know more poeple and be familier with different job this make easy, successful life work for their future.

Lastly, they will have their own credit cart. This is good for student to have his/her own cridet card and to take responsibilty for paying their car insurence and other stuff. some childs have pride and can't ask for money of their parents. For example some student have a big maind that means their brain is older then their age and they will have their own responsibilty not asking for help , they will work hard and become stranger.

Some people thing this is not a good idea for students to work. They are too young and they have to study and they are still high school, have a lot of homework to do,this is right they are too young for working, but still some students need to work because they need to pay for their collage. for some people who have a lot of money it it is nothing to pay for something like collage of their child ,or other stuff like this, but for the families who is earning just for eating, make living and have poor economy this is really hard so we shold realize those people too.

There are two types of individual traits: the that pretend to be someone the're not and the one that stays true to who they are. At some point of a human being life they tend to join those who have bad taste in life and always make horrible decisions and by becoming a follower of those people they also become one of them slowly but surely with time.

We can decide to be ourselves to love who we are deeply in the inside and not care what others think of us in the outside.

Technology have changed people in a lot of ways. People use technology almost everywhere they go. Technology, sometimes, is helpful and sometimes its not. People use technology to find resources that are very helpful. Some people use technology to play games and discover inconvenient sites. Technology change peoples the way they live their lives. Using technology can have some intense effect on peoples health issues. Technology can cause people to perform bad things.

Technology can change the way people live their lives. When people are using technology, they can't focus on what the other person is saying. Technology cause people of losing communication with their parents or their friends. Young people use technology more than old people. Young people are addicted to technology which is bad for them. School's do not like to let students use their cellphones during classes, because they will not focus on learning anything. If someone could take the technology away from young people, they would not communicate with their parents or not even make an eye contact with them. Technology can cause a bad habit for them.

Using technology can have some bad effect on peoples health. A lot of people die in car accidents on account of them using technology while driving a car. People can get addicted to their technology devices, which is bad for their eyes. Using a lot of technology can cause people to go blind. Young people don't get enough sleep because they use their phones and stay up late. Some parents let their kids to use technology and avoid what it can do to their kids. Some parents do care about their kids health issues and they take their devices away. Technology can cause people to get hurt.

Technology can cause people to perform illegal actions. Technology have a very negative effect on the peoples lives. Many people kill themselves because the media tells them to do so. People see negative effects of the technology and then they use them. People kill because of technology. Using technology can turn people aggressive, independent, and impudent.

People shouldn't use technology a lot because it effects them emotionally. Technology is bad for people because it changes the way people live their lives. Using technology can hurt many people in different ways. It is bad for peoples health. Technology effects different kinds of people young and old.        ",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5
D81AEDF6E262,"Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. For example, people can check out books, they can do shopping from online, and play games without speaking to another person. However the technology had positive and negative effects on people's lives. Although some people say that technology is good because all the people can use it for an emergency situation, actually many people believe that technology can change the attitude of the people and technology has more important people behind a screen than people around them.

Although some people say that technology is good because all the people can use it for an emergency situation. Imaging that a family lives faraway from us and need help and nobody lives around this family. Further, in this situation is very necessary the technology because they can be in a very hard situation. For example, when I was in my country many families were living faraway from the city, and some of them did not have any device to communicate with their families or another person; however, some of them were having a really hard lives because sometimes they got sick and they did not have the help from others and they died because the technology was necessary by the moment.

In addition, many people believe that technology is bad because technology can change the attitude of the people. In 1978 people were more respectful and some of them did not study but they show the respect to each other. However, people keeps saying that a person change the attitude because of: movies, music, novels, and cartoons. It is true the some people the use technology constantly they can get mental problems or they get blind using technology over and over. For example, I know this families that have a girl that is fifteen years old, and she likes to see many TV shows. This young girl acts like she is more older than other teenagers because she does not obey to her parents. Her conduct is very bad, but that is the way her parents are growing her. This girl goes out whatever she wants and with whatever she wants. Sometimes I think that is her parents fault because they still keep buying many technology things. They do not paid attention to how their daughter is using the technology. By contrast, allowing children using technology at young age is very bad because some of then do not use it appropriate, and when they get older their parents can not control them because they learn many bad things from the technology. Otherwise parents can go out with them instated of using technology.

Also, many people believe that technology is bad because technology has more important people behind a screen than people around them. It is true that many people are more focus on a screen almost all the time. The Psychologist Generic_Name said that ""it is better have conversations face to face because people can be more clearly about situations"", and he is right because using technology people can lie behind the screen. By this time factories create more devices that makes more people loose their mind in technology. Moreover, about ninety percent of all the people paid more attention to the technology than their families, or people around them. There is one example about lying while using technology, about five months ago I was reading this book that is call ""

Behind the Wed

"" and was very interested because the character was a woman teacher that was having communication with someone that she did not know nothing about it; however, when they were sending messages the person the was behind was acting the was a man but was a girl acting like a man. When this teacher ask her about if they can do a video call she said not because she was lying to her. There are more examples the happens and real life to many people.

In conclusion, technology can be good or bad, but thats depends on the manner of how the people wants to use it. Technology does not stop increasing, yet people have to know how to use it in the appropriate moment and the correct form. Technology can change the life of many people.  ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0

My skill is can speak Vietnamese fluently. I can do a lot of things with Vietnamese, such as translate English to Vietnamese, teach my friends how to speak Vietnamese and to communicate with others Vietnamese.

I can speak both Vietnamese and English at the same time, so that's mean I could translate from English to Vietnamese or even Vietnamese to English. Don't you think it would be helpful for your parents when you 're on a family vacation. That is my main job whenever I go out with my mom, because she doesn't speak English or able to understand it.

My friends are love Vietnamese, they always convince me to teach them this amazing language. When I come to my class my friend start saying ""Xin Chao"" it means ""Hello"" in English, I'm so glad that they love and want to learn it. I had a friend who is American, I taught him how to speak Vietnamese, and now he can speak Vietnamese like his home language.

However it would be helpful if you are in Vietnam or a place where the most Vietnamese people lives, you could ask them in Vietnamese when you need help( I bet if you are from a foreign country and you can speak Vietnamese, they will think you're super cool). I remember that one time, I had a family reunion and I went to Vietnam. Then I was lost, I tried yell ""Help me, I lost, I can't find my parent"", but they couldn't understand what I was said, luckily I can speak Vietnamese, I asked them where is the police station so I could find my parents.

If it was then why do so many people have to get hurt in our day and age. Imagine a heart break, loving someone for so long but them leaving you just cause they didn't want to date you anymore.

D9FA943B5453,"Should schools control the involvement of extracurricular activities, or should extracurricular activities be left to student and their families? Many students become involved in extracurricular activities to enrich their educational experiences, and some even become involved in so many activities that they have little time to study or complete homework assignments. Extracurricular activities can affect a student but also can help students. Extracurricular activities should be left to the students and their families because students would do something they like, and students will concentrate more in class.

First reason why extracurricular activities be left to the students is because, student would be doing something they like. For example, the student chooses a activities they like such as soccer:they would be having fun without stressing out over school or any other problem going on. Many student wouldn't like for the school to put them in a activity they dont like. In fact, many students would prefer to not be in a activity they do not like, than being in the activity they dont like.

Second reason why extracurricular activities should be left to students is because, it would make them concentrate in classes more. For example, many activities require to have good grades to be part of it. Student would focus more in class and work harder to get good grades. This would make the student look good but also the school for having students who out reach others. Having good grades is important when being in any other activity because the student would have to manage their time for school,activities, and homework.

In conclusion, students and their family should be able to control what the student take or not take. If schools were to control what a student can take student would be who they are. They will also not care about the activity and start not caring about their grades. Student would also be happy and calm not having to worry about something they dont enjoy doing. Students are still growing more and more;

the more students we have which means more students to be happy. Student shouldnt be forced to take something they dont enjoy because they wont learn anything from it if they dont like that.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0
DA1ABE125640,"Working in group

Sometime working alone can be hard, because by working alone you can't know your class mates and then you don't have any friends to work. So students should work in group, Although, working with group is more beneficial because you can know more about your class friends, can have fun during work and you can divide work in group.

First reason, why working in a group is more beneficial, because you can know more about your class friends. There are many students that come from other countries or other school so they should work in group. It is good idea to show for those students that come from other countries they will love to know the way they work in class and it is great for English learner because By working in group you have to talk more then work. In group work students can help each other as friends explains something to each other.

Another reason, why working in group is more beneficial, because you can have fun during group activity. Like working on project is fun when you have group, because every person have different idea and when as a group you put all ideas together it is going to be very interesting and by working in group you can increase your knowledge. There are many fun activities in classes that students should work in group like you can debates to other groups on any class topic. That turn a boring topic into fun topic so that way students can also work happily.

Finally, why working in group is more beneficial because you can divide work in groups that way students can complete work on time. students can focus more than working individual. They think it is kind of challenge to them against other groups. that way they give their best to work and complete assignment on time. Students can study as a group for test they can make some quizzes for their group to study for test that way they can do better in test.

Working in a group is important to students and it has many benefits. Many people do jobs with different kinds of experience people and they work as a groups they get many benefits in group work. So it is great for students to work in groups and to learn many new thing from other students. So that's why working in a groups is beneficially.  ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5
DB2E935F461F,"Some say technology is just an extension cord of our bodys. For example a cell phone, you take it where ever you go and use it. We use technology everyday ,but technology can cause less contact with people and a distraction. Although some say technology has a positive effect on lives ,actually it has negative effect on lives.

Despite the fact that technology gives negative effects it actually gives positive effects as well. We use technology everyday it is a part of our life. Technology helps us in many ways for example our jobs, many of our jobs involve technology and the use of it helps us get our job done succesfully and easier. We use technology to commuincate for exanple a cell phone is used to communicate with other people this helps us know where people are if needed or just to see how they are doing. We use technology in school for example computers, cell phones, these devices help students on their everyday assigments it helps them use the internet when needed and it helps teacher with their teaching as well.

Technology causes a distraction. For example cell phones are used every day in schools cell phones distract students from their learning and their peers around them also. While using these moblie devices when not asked to students grades go down and they don't show interest in school anymore. These cell phones are not only a distraction they are an addiction to people. Another example driving while using your cell phone, this can cause a distraction and that can lead to a car crash. Some people are texting while driving or playing music and even the gps is a distraction because you are looking down at the gps instead of keeping your eyes on the road. This shows us distraction can make you loose focus or not pay attention your surrondings.

Cell phones can cause less contact with other people. When using your cell phone you don't look up while walking you just keep your head down this is usually the case with teenagers and kids. Teenagers don't interact with parents, peers and family memebers anymore becasue of these moblie devices. These devices can cause people to not have interaction skills for example people don't know how to approached some one if talked to. This show us that with this technology we are loosing our social skill we don't even know how to say hi to someone anymore it is very sad what technology is doing to us it is stripping us away from the world.

Despite the fact that some say technology has a positive effects it actually has a negative effect. Technology is part of the human life we can't take it way anymore. Technolgy can a distract people and can loose interaction with people. Technology is not bad but it is the way we use it that makes it bad and addicting.

DB6B9E64CFF0,"All around the world involves people learning something new. We learn about different creatures, peoples ,and objects. An Individual that is willing to learn more each and everyday will succeed in life. Some people believe that Emerson statement ""unless someone try to do something beyond what they've have already mastered will grow"", but I disagree. I believe people who try to do something beyond what they've have already mastered, they will never grow because due to lack of experience, and not enough knowledge.

To begin with, every individual want to become something in life. There's literally a certain career that every individual is discovering for. People who wants to learn, participate in certain activities or classes would most likely get the dream career as they wish. Putting the effort is the answer to everyone problems. For instance, my friend Generic_Name shes a server at a restaurant. She is nineteen years old. Generic_Name has been working there since she was 17 years old already. Therefore, Generic_Name knows all of the meals that are served, places that need to be restocked etc. Unfortunately, she getting tired of the job. For some reason, she doesnt want to try something new.

Having only one job experience is barely enough for the person to know about different experiences from other jobs. I strongly believe,as if Generic_Name does not put effort into applying for a new job. She will never grow out of her self esteem or confidence into getting a new job. Clearly, getting involved into different jobs will even give you different alternatives.

Pursuing this further, knowledge is very important when it comes to trying something new. Individuals need to know atleast some knowledge when trying to reach further into their career

For example, my eighth grade teacher Generic_Name would sometimes sit with me at lunch. We would discuss about anything. One day, I brought up about going into high school. Since my middle schools years were coming to an end. I asked her if their were any advice for my upcoming freshman year. She told me high school it will get harder . Also, I needed to become more serious about my education. Mostly likely I will have to pass all exams, sols ,and keep my GPA high. These are the years I will0 start thinking about what I want to do with my career. She gave me advice to guide me through to become better. I strongly oppose, knowing more knowledge about something will make yourself grow.

Obviously, if an individual is trying to do something beyond then what they've already mastered, they will never grow. Just by having lack of experience will lead the individual feeling in their comfort zone. Also, the lack of knowledge will leave the person clueless. Some people may argue that unless the person try to do something beyond what they have mastered, they will grow. How can someone grow from repeating on doing what they do on a normal basis? How can they learn something new with such little knowledge? For example, my dad came to United States when he was 14 years old. He knew little English. Also, he knew how to write some words, but that was all that he knew. He put his full time effort to learn a new language. Each step he took he accomplished. He himself grew out of the stage of not knowing something. He went beyond into what he really wanted.

Finally, everyone needs experience and knowledge in order to grow. Imagine doing a science project on an unknown animal. Surprisingly this creature changes colors, sizes, and shape. Wouldn't you want to invest in the creature more? Learn how the creature lives? Or you would just want to know the basic facts of it? ",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0

I personally disagree on Albert Einstein stated, yes imagination is very important and useful, but it's not more important than knowledge. I say that because, people everyday, all the time, imagine great things all the time but without any knowladge, how will they make that thought turn into reality without having any knowledge what so ever??

Knowledge is way more important that imagination because many inventors, scientist, constrution workers, normal people, use it in thier every-day lives! Imagination us just one step with in into reaching to a goal or something, if you have plenty of knowledge of your dream, you'll be able to grab that goal!

But knowledge isn't just about reaching a goal or building something, it's about having idea or knowing what your doing and what's going around you.

DB85B6DDB462,"Once a British naturalist and politician John Lubbock said, ""your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""and some people believe thats true and I agree with them. I believe that we our self choose our own character traits because no matter who you are influenced by you make your own decisions. Yes, there maybe others who will be in your life time their to persuade you to do bad things but its up to you if you want to stay with those kinds of people.

First of all your character is something that make you,you and thats whether you choose to be good or bad, nice or mean. Their are many different types of people in the world and they have their own characters.

Secondly all people are different and special in many ways like people could help others, they could donate their time to help the elderly, they could spend time with loved ones, or they could do bad things like stealing and other stuff like that but that all comes from you, you decide to do all those thing whether good or bad that your traits as a human being.

Last of all people with bad and good traits can change whether you decide to or not its all up to you nobody else's. People can change in many ways possible you your self just have to decide if that's what you want to do.

In conclusion John Lubbock a British naturalist and politician said that ""your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" and I believe thats true. but its also true that some people some people may influence the way you act like who you grew up with, people who were role model's to you, or people who motivated you in your life time. In other words I believe people choose who they want to be and how they want to act like cause its who they are it's their character. ",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0
DB9BA6D8278F,"Is it expected for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school, i say no to this because there are many students that still do not know what they want to do when they get older. For example there are students that are waiting to know forsure on what they want to do in life and it takes time to know what you want to do. Another example is there are many students that may not be able to afford college, if that is what they are planning and that is why it is hard because many students do not have enough for it, and that is why students take there time thinking what they want to do but can do so they can be successful in life.

Another reason why students do not know what they want to do by the time they enter high school, some parents want there kid to do what they want when it should not be like that, that is also why students have hard time thinking on what to do in the future. Students should have to worry about there future so they end up being successful in life, and end up doing good in life and making your parents proud on doing thins that they couldn't have.

It would help out students if he/she knew what they wanted to do in there life entering high school, so later on they don't have to worry much on what they want to do because they will already know. It gives them an advantage because they already know what they want to do and so they're going to work for it, they can change there mind if they want later on if they would like.

If you know what you want todo in life its a good thing because then you know how hard you are going to work for to get there and be successful in life.

DBC8CBF56BB9,"As a child, I always loved to go to the park. It was my favorite thing to do because I loved playing games with my sisters and sometimes we'd even make up our own game to play. However, things have changed in the past few years and now I barely ever go to the park. The park isn't the same fun and cool place that it used to be anymore, but why?, Why did it change so quickly?.

There are so many reasons to why the park hasn't been visited as much as before, but, yet again only one reason explains why most people barely ever go to the park. The reason for why people never to go the park now is because they don't know what to do at the park anymore. People think that the park is a boring and useless place, but the park have many purposes. People now spend more time on their couch and on their phone and it's very unhealthy and concerning especially when it comes to health issues in the future. The park is a fun and entertaining place to be because there are millions of activities that you could do at the park that are very enjoyable. I'm going to list a wide variety of fun and entertaining activities.

First off, you could always go the park with friends and/or family members. It's always great to be around the people you enjoy the most, especially in a beautiful environment like the park, where everyone could enjoy themselves. Second, you could always head to the park for some quick exercise. You could run, jog, do yoga and much more when you're at the park. It's always a good idea to clear your mind and go for a run at the park when it's beautiful outside. It's always important to make sure your health is in good condition and you can make sure that happens by taking a walk at the park. The third activity is, play some fun games at the park!. When your at the park you could always play some fun games that get you pumped up and happy. With the nice, fresh, open space that is available, the possibilities are endless!. You could make up your own fun games with your friends or family members. Now my fourth fun activity is, throwing a fun party!. It could be a birthday, graduation or even a going-away party, The occasion doesn't matter at all!. Having a nice party at the park is one of the funnest things!. You could do a barbecue and play with your friends and/or family members. celebrating outdoors is a great way to have a blast. My fifth activity is, help clean the park. This activity might sound really boring but helping our your community is 100% worth all of your time. When helping out your community you're not only helping those around you but you're helping yourself, the environment and the animals. Many animals live in parks, for example. a squirrel , birds, worms and even small insects. So next time you go to the park, or are planning to go, make sure you at least pick up one piece of trash, because that small piece of trash could save the animals and the environment.

Now my last but certainly not least reason is, grab a book and head to the park and read. This might seem like boring stacked on top of boring but doing this helps you clam down and relax a lot. When you're in a beautiful and peaceful environment, how could you be mad?.

Why should you try one of these activities?. These activities aren't only fun but they do help you in the long run. Hanging out with your friends and family members help you appreciate the people in your lives but also the environment that it giving access to being able to be around people. Taking a nice run at the park helps you by being healthy and improving your well being. Exercising doesn't have to mean running and jogging, it could be yoga too. Making up your own games help you build up your mind especially when you have access to so much space, you can pretty much create a fun and entertaining game. Reading a book is one of the most important things that you have to do in order to build up a stronger brain and doing to it in a peaceful, quite and beautiful environment makes the experience 100x more pleasing. You don't have to choose one of my ideas, you can choose and make up your own activities!. So next time you go to your local park, make sure you contribute and acknowledge the beauty of your community and make sure it's being properly taken care of.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0
DBDBF971510B,"It is often said that you can not make a child, teenager, or adult do what they do not want to do. Imagine starting a new school year; students are ready to learn, to take classes they will really enjoy, and to see their friends. It comes time to pick up their schedule and they see that there is some classes that they really would not like to take but those classes are required for them to take. A students starts stressing because there is no way they can change their schedule since those classes are required. I believe students should not be required to take a music class, art class, or drama class because it would not only affect them but it would also affect their grades and their future, students would skip the class; making their attendance bad, and students might show up to the class but they would not put in the effort they need in order to recieve the credit.

In many cases, students who do not like the classes they are taking will not do the work in order to get a good grade. Having good grades is what makes your GPA great. We all know that having good grades and keeping a good GPA is very important when it comes to college and universities. Students will need to attend a college or a university in order to get a good paying job. By requiring students to take these classes, you are forcing them to learn something they do not need in the future or that will not fall in their career field. For example, a student might want to work at a fast food restuarant in the future but in high school this students was required to take a class that has nothing to do with it. How would taking a music class help this student achieve their goal of working at a fast food restuarant? Many people may argue that taking an art class should be required because it opens the mind on being creative but again what does an art class have to do with what a student wants to be in the future? Unless that students wants to be an artist of course.

Secondly, if you force a student to take a class they do not want to take, they would just skip the class or just won't show up that whole school day. Having good attendance is also very important to have because if students do not have good attendance they get put on an attendance chart. An attendance chart is a chart where students have to sign in at the time they got to a class and sign out at the time they left that class. If a students keeps skipping the class they do not like, their grades get worse because they are not recieving the work they need to due to skipping class and their attendance keeps worsening which will only get them into bigger trouble. For instance, where I live if a student does not show up to school for more than fifteen days they get put into a juvenile detention center. Requiring such classes that should be electives will not motive a student to come to school because they are really not learning anything important from those classes.

Lastly, every high school student knows that they need a certain amount of credits in order to graduate. In order to recieve those credits a students grades, GPA, and attendance must be excellent. Requiring such classes that should be electives will not motivate a student to get good grades, good GPA, or good attendance. If anything making these classes required will only make these students less motivated into coming to school and earning those high school credits.

In conclusion, forcing or requiring students to take these classes that should be electives would affect them mentally. It would affect them mentally because they might not be as good as the other people in that class. Students should not be required to take such classes like art, music, or drama; those classes should stay as electives. Helping every student learn new material, graduate, and get them into college should be our main focus instead of making them take classes they do not need to. ",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5
DBDE16551908,"I think the best way is to work as a group. You might ask why. is the best way students get to learn, For example; I'm the type of student that like to hear about peoples opinion. By listining to other people opinin give the other student a idea on how the project or the assigment should be done. When student get the chance to express they idea they feel confident no fear to express themselve.

Many students like to work bby themselve, therefore no other student interrupt the by asking to many question. Most of them already have a topic to talk about they already have a plan. For Example student that work alone they mostly working at their own pace, working alone give then the chance of finishing on time.

Working as a group give the student the chance of dividing the work in different sections, For example; this student would do this part, the pther student would design the project, the other student would do the research. Dividing the project in different part let the student look or choose the part the thing is easy to do ot they know how to do it already.

Student get to meet new people, by doing a project like a group student somtime don't get to choose who they work with, The profesor might give the students a group of people they never meet before. working as a group with new people let you find a new ways to work or write. For example you meet this new student who make a T chart and write the good about this topic and the negative side about the topic next to it. After looking at it he decide what side he should talk about.

You get things done a lot faster by doing in groups as I said before working with a group let the work get done a lot faster, it's give the people the chance of focusing and the part they have to get done. If you finish your part of the project or assigment, you can volunteer to help other team mate. For example someone that works by themselve might need more time, because she's working by her self and you get the chance to volunteer to help her out on something, she might found difficult to do.

In my conclusion, working like a group it teach the students to listen to other peoples thoughts and, it's the best way students work as one. But other peolpe would say that working alone is the best choice, because it teach the student how to make decision on their own and how they should write their own paper with anybody helping them out.

Also someone that like when people are honesty with them they wont care because it good to be honesty with them beacuse what if there doing something bad that you dont like and your hones with them and you tell to fix that thing that where doing that you dont like. Another thing if you get in trouble in school be hones with your teacher and tell them what happened be hones dont ever lie to your teacher. Then if your in a relationship with some and you dont like them anymore dont be shy then the true be hones. finally if you go to a store and you tell something from the store and they tell you are you stealing something tell them the true beacuse if you leave with out paying you can get in trouble with the police that why be hones with some ask you if your stealing something tell them then true be hones.

DCCA609D1212,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""Success isn't around the corner. You'll have to work as hard as you can until you reached your limits. Always trying new things will make you grow."" Life can be great, if you know how to make the best out of it. Although, it may seem that trying is hard and it's a waste of time, it is actually true that trying can make you achieve your goals.

Trying my hardest showed me who I really am. I accomplished some of my goals, but I always try to be inspired. This helped me get through my problems. None of my goals have been easy, they're hard, but that doesn't stop me. My plan is to be successful in life and not to be a failure. Sometimes I loose and sometimes I win.

I used to be 275 pounds, I wasn't happy with the way I looked. I also experience random pain in my heart. My body was telling me to start loosing weight. I really wanted to go and loose all of my weight, but my lazy side said to just sit in the couch and play video games all day. I had to get my life together and started going to the gym, the following day. Day by day, I started to feel something different. I felt more energetic and strong. I ate healthy and those heart pains were gone. My parents were always there for me to encourage me. I also wanted to be an example to my little brother that anything is possible, as long as you try.

I lost 58 pounds to be exact. I feel lighter than ever. I went beyond my limits to accomplish my goal. All hard work always rewards you as it did for me. My reward was having cheat days. I always love cheat days because you can forget about your diet for a day and eat whatever you want. Cheat days are the best to have, but not all the time. You can loose track and fall.

Accomplishments are hard to achieve, but it's a lot of fun to do them. They can make you a better person and makes your life so much easier. As long as you try your best, you can do anything. My grandpa told me that trying is your best buddy. It can make you push yourself and it can take you places you've never seen in your life. ",2.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5

DD474E5804C0,"Do you think students should work on assignments from school at home?

In this prompt

I will argue about how students can study from long distance, not all schools approve the current subject. If students were to study from home it would be difficult for them to understand what the assignment that is being asked to complete at certain time. The students should be able to afford a device which is necessary to study any subject. Attending classes from home can cause for students to be able to work more and do their assignments on time.

Schools will not exist if students leave to study home which will make it hard for them to communicate with teachers when help is needed. Students would not meet each other or talk physically which would be awkward, can cause them to not trust each other if it comes to a project that needs to be done. Physical education would not be a class since everything would be on devices which is a conflict, which is needed to graduate. In many short word students will be gaining so much weight that they'll not be able to do certain sports they want or walk to their destination.

Typing online or video conferencing is not easy if the person on camera is shy and doesn't like video conferencing which can be very often. Accessing to both subjects can not be trusted if the school will be monitoring every movement you take on your device. Testing online can be easy to cheat if the teacher is not around walking and watching what your doing. Students might not know many things but cheating and being sneaky are the two most known words we understand very well.

In other words there are advantages to studying online, disadvantages online and it would be a big disappointment for students to fail almost every class that needs to be taken for graduation. If they have a job they will consider work their first priority instead of school. Student's would not receive a scholar ship or diploma so that they can go to college and accomplishing the goal of having a better job.

Some people say that school is very important for students, that they'll earn more money than their parents who probably dont have a well paid job and education. But I think it can benefit sometimes it can be a amazing idea for students to study home because they won't drop out of school. Students have different emotions that trigger them to want to leave school behind, since they start working more to pay bills that need to be paid each month.

All students should go to school to focus on what they want to be in life or do. Physical experience is not the same as typing online or video conference. Knowing that student's can succeed in different ways is not bad even so they will be expected to have any sort of education someday in the future. School is providing knowledge for those who pay attention to school and more. Believing you can do what you always dreamed of is a motivation that will help learn more about life and the way it works.     ",3.5,3.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,3.5
DDD3771E1DF6,"Many people believe that they do not need advises from others in order to take decisions in their life,and they believe they should take their own decisions. I do not agree with them. It is important to listen what other people think about it. Each person is different in a special own way and someone else might help you to solve your problem. I believe people should seek guidance from experts and authorities because they may have a better idea,or they may have been in the same situation before.

One of the main reasons is that other people may have been there before and they may know what to do. For example, You are undecided about taking swimming classes or piano classes,and you know you are a great swimmer,but you've also wanted to play piano since you were 6 years old. Your brother have been in that situation before, and he thinks that you should take piano classes from Monday to Wednesday after school, and swimming classes every Friday after school, but you have to work from Thursday to Sunday;then he says that you should take piano classes every Monday and Wednesday after school ,and Swimming classes every Tuesday after school .You believe that is what best suits for you.

Another reason is that other people might have a better or different idea than yours. Another example is that your parents give you two choices: going to Canada for spring break or going to The Bahamas for Christmas break. Generic_Name,your best friend have already visited those places and she tells you to go to Canada because she knows you love extreme low temperatures .You tell your parents that you've decided to go to Canada and once you are there you realize that it was the best decision you've taken. Thanks to your friend's advise;you are enjoying your trip,and you are glad that you asked for her opinion.

On the other hand,letting others influence on the decisions you take is not always the best thing to do. A simple example can be that you go to the mall and decide to buy a pair of shoes but you do not know what color to choose, so you ask your sister and she thinks that the red pair is the best for you; you buy it and when you get home, you realize that you do not like those shoes. The first thing you would probably do is blame on her because she told you to buy the red pair, but if you take that decision by yourself and you regret for the decision you make; You cannot blame on somebody else except for you.

In conclusion, people who seek guidance from their family,experts, or authorities are most likely to take the right decision. All persons sometimes may need an advise from someone on what to do, or if they should follow their own instincts; but the one who will make the decision is you, so do not blame on others for the decisions you make. Humans are not perfect and we do not always take the best decisions in our life; but with help from others , we will be able to make them right and move on.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0
DE1A1149D54B,"I agree with that because positive attitude always bring the success in our life. It helps us with alots of things in our life. All people love those who have positive mentality and a good personality. In order to be successful in life u need to be respectful with every single things that we do everyday. We can get so much benifit out of it. It helps people to get more friends and make a good community. It also make our family think that we are smart and make them feel proud of us.

The first thing we all should do is to love our self if we cannot do that it will be hard for us to control our positive attitude. if we don't love our self we can't love others as well as you do to ourself. We are human we cannot be same as others in some point we make mistakes in life we always should try to move forward. Some of us might have have seen some people they can't be satisfy with their life beacause of their behavior and the way how they think of there life. We need to conduct our self in a perticular way to bring the power of success.

There are many people who can't show their love to people or who are kind of broke on their life most of them have negative mentality. Its not their fault maybe the situation makes them to be like that some of us living with depression and it causes a massive differents into our brain our thinking area and more other part or side effects. It also happened to me when i was freshmen during the highschool year. I started to giving up on my life i didn't feel like to doing anything in life. Every single day was the hell of my life. i broke down myself and put my self somewhere where no one can find me. I didn't talk to anybody just trying to stay at home all the times and realised how could i get out of this kind of situation. I was starting to loose friends in that time. Only those will understand if they ever gone through depression.

That was the worst feelings i ever felt in my life. i was trying so hard to figure out why this is happening to me and where does this come from and didn't get any response out of this. I felt negative every time. I tried so hard to change the situation but it didn't work. I didn't have anyone to share my feelings all i did is just to kept that in my heart and made my self cry alot. I throught of myself i will never be successful in life.

After few days passed one of my friend came to my house just to visit our family member and me. when i see him i was little happy to see him after a long time. i took him into my room and we were talking about somethings and recently he came up with a topic which is call depression. He knew how i was feeling with my life so he started to giving me some lesson to make me feel better and everything. First he told me i need to changed the way how i think about my self and people and he also told me there are many people who always try to push others down and make them feel bad and make you think something that is not good for you. My friends told me to ignore those and listen to my own heart. No matter, how u feel, always love your self and change the way how you think of youself. As a human no body is happy about their life in some point their sad but the main thing is we got to move onto forward. Forget about everythings that happened in the past.

After he have told me all the lesson i was feeling way better than the past i realised how crazy i was before and the way of my thinking. My friend he was so motivated. Whatever he told me it was so appriciated to me and it forced me to changed my self to become a normal and to be a possitive person. I decited to not to keep my life stop because i dont want to be in the same situstion as before. I want to make my family friends and all of my relatives feel proud of me. Every one of us need to love their selves and if they think in a negative way to bring the success in their life, it will never work thats why we all should try to handle our mind in a positive way. It will help all of us to become successful in our life. This is why the positive attitude is the key to success in life. ",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5
DE20CFA52C1D,"What are the benefits of working with a group and working alone? I believe that working in groups helps you to have more ideas, more knowledge, because if you communicate with your group members, they'll think about different ideas to proceed the work that is getting done. Working alone sometimes helps you more than working with groups because you are responsible for your own work.

I rather work by myself because I've had bad experience working with groups. When I work in groups sometimes I'm the one that has to do all the work, and in my opinion if we are working in groups we have to help each other, communicate and share our thoughts because if we don't do that what's the point of working in groups. However, I think working in groups is important because you can come out of your comfort zone and be free to share your thoughts with your group members, and you can make friends too. For example, I'm a very shy person, it's rare the times I talk in class but when I'm in a group I have to talk, share my thoughts with my group members and communicate with them.

Reasons why I prefer working alone are: I focus more doing my own work, it's only my responsibility not others, I have to worry to turn it in on time, if i get a bad grade it's going to be my fault not others, I'm responsible for my own actions, I have to make sure if everything is right to get all the credit.

Reasons why I don't like to work in groups are: sometimes they're not responsible for doing their part, if they do their work they do it all messy( you can't even understand their hand writing), they play around too much because sometimes they take it as free time, they spend most of the time on their phone instead of doing what they are supposed to do, sometimes they don't do their part in time and we have to turn it in late and don't get all the credit.

I believe working in groups is beneficial but at the same time it's not, I think it depends with the people you work with, because if you work with people that do their work and actually care about school they will definitely be beneficial and make your group work out. If you work with someone who doesn't care and is always playing around, you won't get anything done and will receive a bad grade unless you do all the work and the other person will just get credit by not doing anything, in that case there is no point to work in groups.

In conclusion, I believe it's more beneficial to work alone than groups because you can focus more on what you're doing and take responsibility of your own work, because if you don't take care of your school work nobody is going to do it for you. So you have to chose what's better for you and what's going to benefit you more, but for me I feel like working alone is more beneficial for me than working in groups.

DE54A8F9C29C,"Should students be required to take a class in the arts and should those classes even be a elective? I believe students should have a choose in what they take while in school. Most students when they are not interested in something will most likely not do good in that subject. If you put students in those classes when they dont want to take then the pass rate may drop in those classes. The music, drama, and art class should stay as electives for students that enjoy those classes. I do see how those classes can help a students with some aspects on life but if they dont want to be in that elective then they wont be as involved as everyone else. School is meant for learning and not just putting students in a class they dont like, it's not a good way to teach students. If the student have a choose in what they take, then will students find it interesting and will want to learn more. The classes students choose to take should help them get ready for there future career. I am opposed to having classes in the arts as a required class but I do believe they should stay as electives.

Since I am still a student myself, I know what it is like to be put in a class that I do not finding interesting. I do not feel as if the school should have the right to choose our required electives. Student should have a choose in what class they want because it appeals to them and it's something they actually want to take. If a student choose that class they then choose it for a reason. Thats why if a student gets something they dont like, they are no going to be as engaged in that class and not learn that much as well. A student should have a right not to take the classes in the arts and schools should not make it a required class neither. If school makes those classes required then the pass rate is going to drop and students will not want to attend school as much because they are failing a class they don't even like.

The schools should keep those classes as electives and not as core classes. There are plenty of students that enjoy taking those classes and that do really good in them as well. The classes in the arts are great classes to have a option to take while in school, it opens so many doors for students that want to make a career out of those classes. I'm sure some students learn a lot of life lessons while taking those classes and has helped them in some way. I believe you can learn a lot of skills in those classes as long as your engaged in them and actually like the classes. School should keep music, drama, and art class as electives so the people that want to take it can.

The classes students take should help them in there future career. If a student want to take a class that he want to work in as a career, they shouldn't be rejected to take it because the classes in the arts are required to take.

For example, if a student whats to become a construction work, then I do not see how taking a music class is going to help that student reach his goal to be in that career. The things students do now while in school can change there lives just by simply making them take a class they dont like. There are a wide range of classes students can take that will better prepare for when they leave school. The classes students take now will help them but if schools make the students take something they dont want to take then will it possible ruin them. Thats why students shouldn not be required to take the classes in the arts and choose in what they want to take.

I don't believe schools should me the classes of the arts so be required to take. But I do believe they should stay as electives in the school. Students should be able to choose what they take in school and they should take something that is appealing to them. The classes to have benefits to some of the students and is a great elective class to have. The students should be able to pick a class that is going to help them in there future career and also get a aspect in what they are getting into. In conclusion, the class in the arts classes are a important role in the students experience but manly to the student that enjoy taking those classes.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0
DE8EAEAC72D9,"Imagine of having your own business by the time you graduate from high school. I think its a good idea for students to commit or take specific courses at a young age for their future lifestyle because you will have more experiences also you can save a lot of money, you don't have to worry about for college. Althogh some people think its a bad idea for students to commit to a career because they just into high school, However they will have more experience by the time they graduate frome high school and live a better lifestyle because they already havea good career and have money and they might have graduate early and started their own family or family business. Some students like to be me a business man or women so the plan to take classes about thoses to topics so they can learn more and they can help the others with their busines.

The first reason why its a good idea to commit to career in a young age is because you will gain more experience and gather information that can help you with your career and have a better lifestyle so you can have everything you need and don't need nobody to help and you can ask others for their advices on hows to gain more experience and some students can take online class. I understand having to plan your career little early in hard because you have to have good grades and enough credits graduate early. So if you want to have better lifestyle you have to put in te hard work and you can't stop unitl you reached your goal and your happy with it. also you apply for jobs to gain as many experience you wanna gain for explam you can work at the fast food resturants and at subway and the doctor offices or at walmart and forever twentyone. and having a business is hard because my dad has one and we barly get to see him because he's so busy and his bussines is not even to close to us is at TN and we get to see him only once a month or two.

The second why having a career is so impartant because you can save alot of money like a lot. Because saving money is good because you can really rich and you have to be selfish in the begging if you want to became something great in life. although you have to spend a lot oof money at first because you having for your classes and programs that your in so you can study what you want and there are some school that will help their students to be succesful in life but have to put in the hard work first if you don't then thats a big problem because your not going to be rich your not going have a lot of money to have good lifestyle. So thats why students need to applying for jobs at age of sixteen and build baby steps to save money and doing good at school and having a better. There is alot of ways for stuents to gain money and save them for explam you make cupcakes at home and sale them at school or other events you can make alot of things a sale them and that how you save alot of money by working hard in school and having a job or making stuff.

The last reason for having your career planed out in a young is to help you in the future weather you have to go college or not and if you have enough credits and your testing scores are good and you don't have a history of getting into a lot of fights and trouble. Then college is for you and you don't have to worry about having to pay for college becuase you can get a schoarship to the best schools ever and college is a important part of your career and life its where you can get more education and help you to become a better at what your doing in the future and if you want to something big you have to work hard like you can't stop because people that put the work they don't stop until they got they want in life and honstley some people have to work hard for everything they want but others don't because the were born with golden life.

Although some its a good idea to have experience with other careers and with making stuff and having alot of money and not playing for college but first you have to put in the hard work in oreder to be commit to a career in a young age because its really hard when you wanna commit to something don't have the goods and good testing scores for in that means you have to do double the work that your already doing. some peple can do anything when they put their brain and mind to it and thats good because if i only foucus in school would have been a straight AB student but i didn't so its hard for me to do that now because there is no time left and what i am trying to say is that don't wait until the same minute to do something specially if you wanna have good career and want to commit to it.

E0538F7AB083,"I agree with this statement, first impressions with people or places are difficult to changed.

But first the definition of Impression is a lasting effect, opinion, or mental image. Is a belief of understanding of sth. Here is a example in a sentence,

I made a bad impression by arriving late for the interview.

I always see the bad and good things in each person and in each places too. But sometimes the impressions can change, It depends on the person. Now I'm gonna make some examples about the first impressions in people and with places.

For example, If I'm going to a restaurant the first impressions that I'm looking for, are If the local is cleanly(floor, chairs, etc..), the bathroom they aren't dirty, the employers(making sure that they are using gloves when they touch the food and when they prepair the food, Plague(rats, cockroach, etc..) that's very important because we don't want to get transmit a bacteria or something like that). Another example, If I'm going to a friend house, my first impressions that I'm looking for, are typically the same of the restaurant, instead of the part of the employes(obviously), but if the house is dirty, for example: (the floor, the kitchen, the bathroom, etc...) that impressions can change for me, because they probably clean the house everyday, but just that day they don't clean it.

And now I'm gonna make some example of first impressions for a person, the first impression that I saw in a person is the personality(vibes, etc..), the education level(respectful, responsable, etc..), the way of she/he dress it(outfits) that's when the phrase ""dress to impress"" takes place,

if the person is comic, etc.. Some person do the same, but some person just talk in the bad way of other persons, and sometimes they don't know them, they don't talk to them, and that's too bad impression for the person that is doing that, they are wrong :/

So my point, is I just said before, the impressions can change and it depends on the person. ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,2.5
E060D90D6CB9,"Dear Principal

I don't agree with your decisions about the new school policy. I think that students needs exercise. I believe that students joining sports is a good thing for there health and it also makes them happy. Its not good for students to think about school work too much because it causes stress.

If you change your mind maybe more students would actually work hard in school because of there accomplishment's in school. Kids should be aloud to play any sport without doing anything.

If they think about school work and sports at the same time it might cause them to stress out. At the same time i also want them to have fun in school. There are lots of reasons why students shouldn't have to work hard just to play the sport they want. Changing school policy is a bad idea.

I think it will encourage kids to work harder in school. Not only it will encourage them they will also have a better future.

Changing the school policy back to normal would be a good thing for kids. They will also have a good exercise everyday because it encourage the to practice. I am also a sports fan my myself. I know how it feels if that happens to me.

E0C521DEB367,I disagree with the school board because we not trying be in school more time in school. Also students need to have their own time outside of school with family and friends. I also think this because students spent 8hrs in school more than what they spend at home. My other idea is that i think the schools around that county should have a essay in all schools asking students about how they feel about this decision. The county should take the students decision as a answer about what they think because our ideas matter too. Also the school should be thinking about the students benefits of being in school for longer and for less not just to one side. I think if they did that they point of view will change a lot knowing what students think also it would help them know about what students they are dealing with that would be a great advantage for them.

E13F3C0CB738,"Can failure lead to success?

Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.""

Many people who have dreams and goals would agree.

If failure is on the road to success it will give motivation, thought of improvement, and an opportunity to have experience.

Failure doesn't always have to be a bad thing.

Failure will give people that push of motivation many need. If students fail once then they know they have to get up and keep trying. Are many people just going to give up because they failed one time? Let's say somebody is setting a high goal and fail; if that person sets a high goal they will have to understand failure will come in some part of that; it is a reach to get there. As soon as failure kick's in, so should the motivation. If not then nobody will be able to meet the goal of success they want. For example,student is walking into class and spent the whole night studying for this test.

She turns it in and thinks she did well. Turns out that it is the opposite. She has the chance to retake it and is taking the chance. Sometimes expectations don't go the way people would like. That doesn't mean eventually the expectation won't get met.

It just means to keep trying.

Another reason on why failure can bring success is because it gives thought of improvement. Everyone knows the saying ""You learn from your mistakes"". That saying is very true.

If something goes wrong because the way it was dealt with, will the same mistake happen again? Of course not! People see when the mess up or fail after it happens and will try to do better.

That is improvement and it's leading you to success.

Then we will know where to start and where to fix things.

It's apart of succeeding. People who have succeeded can tell others than without at least one fail, they would not of made it to where they are now.

Last but not least, it gives you experience.

If we didn't fail there would be no experience for the next goal. Having that experience of failure will help.

When the goal is met and finally succeeded then there will be an amazing story to tell. Especially because failure was around. Speak on the obstacles that were faced and how to get through without giving up. Having this experience and speaking about it can influence others as well. Maybe some people also have failed but they want to give up, encourage others that failing doesn't mean you still can't succeed.

To conclude, failure can be a big step to success if used the right way. Don't sit there and give up because failing is a way closer to the goal. Use failure as motivation, thought of improvement, and an opportunity to have an experience. In this case, failure is a great thing. ",3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0
E1920CC1D734,"Should young students commit to a career. I think young students should not commit to a career yet because their minds can change at any momment and if they commit to a career and if they start to not like the career they wanted they will wasted all their time and effert to that one career. Also, If the class's for the career are defficult they and they give up halfway and drop out the class and never try again. So their goal to get the career they want is not in reach for them anymore. Also, you may still not be ready to commit to a career because there are different things you may be into and like doing more then the job you want to do. However, some people may not feel the same way as me on this topic. people may think that is a good idea that young student commit to a career because they have an idea of what they want to do later in life and won't be stuck as may other students may be. I still think at students that are young should not commit to a career yet. so For my conclusion if you are in high school and if you don't know if you want to commit to a specific career don't because you can chage you're mind at anytime.

No one want to live their life with the negative way that not good for everyone, their family, and everyone around them. Let thinking about that when you have positive attitude and good energy and give it to everyone first thing you got is people will love you because that make people feel comfortable when near by, they feel your positive energy you giving to them,and you will have a good friendship when you give them the best feeling they need after all the problem, stress in their life. The second thing is that make yourself happy, life is tired you will not happy if always have a negative attitude in life, no one can make you happy except yourself. The last one is some people think they are having very bad life, they always get the worse thing than other people, and they want to give up but if they looking around them they are not the one have the baddest life. Follow that way you will never become success.

When you do a good thing make everyone happy and you will feel like you are so cool, you are very good, anyway you will feel happy because you was did a good thing and when they happy they will give their love, their respect. They like you and when you get in trouble they will help try their best to help you without your money like the way you make them happy. Or the long time no see they still remember you in the good memory, and not forget you make feel you important in the world everyone not forget you, that is the success in life.

I am very sure most of us learn from teachers and parents are always the positive way and positive attitude, they will not teach you some thing bad and negative, what is mean? That mean they want you to live the most happy you can because they know they can't go with you or following you forever. The success not mean you become you must be rich or must become famous, you can think it the easy way is make yourself happy. For example, when you rich but you not live positive attitude and people not respect you, love you, support you, or you always worry about your money, you get stress or some people always say they love you but for real they just love your money when become poor they will leave, I am sure you still not happy for that way.

People think they have very bad life and always think the worse thing that the negative attitude and it will go with you forever and you never have the better life, the life you want and you never become successful. Why people always say never give up or you don't know how far you can touch your dream, you think it very far away, some it next to you but you just don't take your chance and your time to finish your dream. For example you think you don't know or not good at anything, why you don't try it? whatever you are you still not doing great for the first time just do your best, you can do better for the next time, you will never know what you can until you try it, you believe you could and you did it. When you touch your dream by hard-working, and you will know the challenge in the life make you grow up.

in conclusion, the success in life is can be base on the attitude you have, the positive is always good thing for your life, that make you life is easier don't make you life become too hard. The first of all you need make yourself happy, then you can make other people happy, finally don't give up make your life going up by your hard-working if you can do all of those thing you are successful not by your career or your money but by your good energy and positive attitude make it become success.

You will grow because now days there is too much competition in everything for examples Companies,Schools and Sports etc. I think if you try to do something more than you have mastered will make you more better than you are because if you have mastered in something it will not be a bad idea to practice more even you know everything because everyday somebody is getting good by watching people those have mastered everything so when they go against them they will beat the master because they already know whats the master is going to do and they will try to protect themselves. Here are some examples when people play video games like fortnite people be watching streamers from YouTube and twitch to get better and learn some new moves and after watching them for some weeks they know what they are going to do next and how they going to play at any bad or good situation

Here are some example like Apple is big company and Samsung is a big company they both have some bad relationships like Apple always make a good phone which is always better than Samsung but Samsung try their best to make a better phone than Apple so, Samsung has been trying to make better phones then Apple by trying to copy their features for examples the screen size, The GB, and motherboards. only reason Apple is making better phones because they have mastered everything and they are still making some new technology which Samsung might not able to make in next two or three years and here is a another example they are so many cars in the world for example Mercedes and Lamborghini they both are good cars Mercedes is a old company so they know everything about the car the way the want to make it luxury or fast and for example Mercedes is a fast and a luxury car where Lamborghini is a fast and luxury car,

Here is a last example like your coach if you play sports you need a coach which is going to teach you how to play and teach some moves that you can use to beat your enemy and make you strong and tell how to dodge some stuff when they try to hit you for example people play boxing and for new people they hires coaches which help them to learn how to play and stuff. and teach you how to defend your self from getting hit on your face or hitting him back.

E3096B04916A,"Nowadays many students become involved in extracurricular activities to enrich their educational experiences. There is a debate if school should or should not control students involvement in extracurricular activities. Some people think that students should be more involve in extracurricular activities. However, I think that the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families because students will have to much pressure on their shoulders, students will not have enough time to complete school assignments or study, and students have to work.

One reason, why the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families is that students will have to much pressure on their shoulders. They will be always worrying about school stuff and the fact that they have to spend a lot of time in extracurricular activities. Spending to much time on extracurricular activities can led students to a depression. They will not get enough rest because of not doing anything else ,but extracurricular activities. Students will get tired that they would not want to do anything else. Students

Another reason, why the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families is that students will not have enough time to complete school assignments or study. Students will have little time to study for a test or quiz. Evidently, not having enough time to study can led students to fail their classes. Students will not turn homework or projects on time. Students deserve to have extra time to study.

Final reason, why the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families is that students have to work. Students work to be independent. Students work to pay for their future education. Students work to help their families financial. Students work to achieve their future goals. They work to not have a miserable life in their future.

To conclude, for these reasons and so many more is why I think that the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families. Students will have a lot of pressure, students will have lack of time to study or finish with their homework, and students got a job. Schools should think a little bit more about student's responsibility and how controlling students involvement extracurricular will impact their life.

I think student would not be benefit if they had distances learning. Many student would not focused during the lesson they would just do whatever they want so they won't learn as much as if they had a teacher. If student had online classes they would not get the attention necessary if they need help.

Some student often have a bad day so they often don't pay attention and they just don't do the work that is assigned to them. they often just search the answer without learning but they think that's okay because no one is watching them. Many of them don't learn the subject but still somehow they passed the class. Other Important, reason why student won't benefit from online classes is that the may have some big problem in their life and they need someone to talk to but their one home so they feel sad, but if they were in school they can talk to a teacher,coach,counselor, or any other they feel happy to talk too. Other student may be sad they don't have someone to talk too.

Online classes don't benefit students because they don't have the help they need. When student take online they can paid someone to do their work, and pretend that they did the work. One reason they can ask their brother to the work for them so they are not really learning anything. Other example, student may request some extra help but they won't get it because they don't a teacher with them. so they just don't understand but when it comes to do the text they failed. Other example might be that they are having family problem so they won't do the online classes. And they would not be focus. Having online classes won't help student in their life. one example is that they won't have friends and when they go to the real world they are going to have trouble talking to people because they don't know how too. Other important reason why school should not have online classes is that many student need to talk to a counselor for that they want to be when they grow up. and most. Most counselor guide their student the right way they teach the career we want to have in our life. but they take online classes they don't have the opportunity to chat with them.

When students get video conferencing they don't really understand because something the video don't really explain what the student want to learn. one reason is the student might feel lazy to replay the video so he does not understand. and if he was at school teacher would help them with all their work . School should not have video conferencing.

Student are going to feel bad when they get older that they took online classes.. one reason they going to feel bad is that they did not enjoy high school life. let's Image if a student was really good at soccer or any other sport and if they had played high school they could of get a scholarship, and maybe become one of greatest,

but they did'it because they were talking online classes. school should not have online classes because it take the right of student in playing high school sport.

Overall, student would not benefit from online classes. they won't learn that much at home, and student need the attention to do work, they also need people to help them with their work.

Staying on track can help people focus. Some students from my school today lose track and end up not doing their work. Later on students fell unaccomplished from not doing the work and not accomplish anything. If students can focus and stay on track they can achieve more.

Although some people may say that inactivity severs a purpose, the real point to consider is that doing something can accomplish much more by staying on track, working hard, and getting things done will lead to accomplishing more.                                        ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5
E34E1B7D1691,"""I want to be a singer!"", is what I told everyone, at 8 years old, I wanted to become someday. As I kept getting older, I started exploring more career opportunities that I could achieve someday and my interest started to grow. With high school and the programs and opportunities that they give us, It is tough to choose between the one I want the most. I wouldn't want to risk any of my hard work into a career that I would end up disliking. With that being said it would be a huge honor if I you could give me the opportunity to visit and get to know about the work that interest me.

While many students at my age have already decided what career they want, I am not sure enough to make a decision yet. However, I know that this program will help me decide what is best for me in the future, by learning the skills and requirements to the career I may be interested in. This program would help me sign up for events, classes or even trips to the road of my success.

In fact, even by talking to someone with the career I am interested in would help my knowledge. Also, it would help me narrow down between which career I would most likely succeed in.

The dedication there would have to be behind getting to where I belong to with your help, wouldn't be a problem at all. With the skills I have already learned with being in high school, I would already know how to manage my time with my career and real life. Your help wouldn't go to waste but would lead me in the right direction to my future. On the other hand, this career might persuade me to become an artist and not to have given up on that dream I once had. I am pretty sure that if you and of course, myself see an improvement in getting involved with music, and having a huge passion, you could help other dreamers like me in the future. Most importantly, by helping them find the right path for them.

Once the choice has been made and there has been improvement with the work I have put in and also being sure with what career I want in my future, I would gain more passion and inspiration. This would help me to push until I have accomplished everything I have worked for. I couldn't of made it without this program though, this company could help me a lot if you give me the chance to show you that it would be guiding me in the right path. With the opportunities you give, that not everyone sees, I may become one the greatest artist in this generation.

I am hoping you really consider the motivation I have behind this, to do whatever it takes to explore my options out in this world.

With that being said, It would be an honor to have the opportunity to explore the options in my career with your help. By leading me in the right path, and by not doing something I am not sure about and letting that go to waste. I would be able to develop the skills you guide me in and also by keeping me on track. The road this company would lead me in would help me become successful. May you please give me the opportunity to suceed? I would love to have your help by keeping me on track to my future.               ",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0

But how will this program help both the older and younger students? Well, I will be telling you three things how this program is helpful for the older students and younger students.

First thing is, the younger students will want some help from the older students because they know more than the younger students and it would be a great help. If this program is still going than more and more students will start joining in and they can start forming groups and they can each work on something different.

secondly, this program can be very helpful by teaching students that are getting poor grades or poor scores on their test they're getting. Students can even donate binders,books,folders,crayons,pencils,pens,paper,etc. Even the students themselves can start their own fundraiser by making food and can raise money.

lastly, This whole program can be very useful for the community and helpful for the students. This is why this program is so helpful and important for us student and adults

When your parent is sick and you are a doctor you know what to do right away .Sometimes people are so close to get a heart attack but when you are there you save there life alot . I like to work at places were i can take to people and i like it to cause when you have other jobs and people barely talk to you it is boring and at hospital you can go to other people's room and can say how was your day and talk with them and tell them how do they feel. That's why i want to work at the hospital to have fun with them take good care of them they would like me alot cause i used to be a person that tooked care of old people and i used to play with alot and made them to color with me . They also liked to play with me tag but i always ' said yes and they would be so happy and we only played for a little bit because they would get tired.

I would wash my hand's all the time and make them smell my hands so they can know that i washed them.

thats why always wash your hands.

That's a good choice cause you want to be healthy and always run never stop doing laps outside cause you would not be healthy just by staying inside eating all day .

E4051C85D12E,"If we think about the words that the British Prime Minister Wiston Churchill sait "" succes consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" There is a lot of truth is this words well that is what I believe. So how important is the role that failure plays in the process to reach success and don't loss enthusiasm in the proccess? In my opinion it is very important because it make us gain experience, improve our skills, and it make you feel comfortable and happy at the end.

Les't think about how you feel when your staring in the proccess to reach a new goal that you propose to youself it could be hard at the begin, because is your first time in that enviroment and maybe you have none experience there, and that could make you to fail some times and could be desesperate to you.

you or people migth say, "" this is not for me,"" because you already fail a few time and you think but is just the beginc how will be the future. That could make you loss enthusiasm, but if you think what happend when you keep going with all this fails you're gaining a lot of experience during that proccess. For example, when I star to study at Generic_School it was a big change for me staring with the lenguage, because I came from a coutry of Spanish speakers and here the official lenguage is English, so I remember that in the begin my English was really poor, and I just knwe a few words in English like good morning or the name of some school's supplies, but everytime I did something wrong I learnd something new from that mistake wich make me gain experience in the proccess of my English learning. Even if sometimes is embarasing to say or spell worng a word infront of people you will be learning to do it rigth with the time. Therefore we should see the fails as a good oportunitie to gain more experience.

Most of the time you will notice some changes in yourself while you're reaching some goal, I'm talking about the change on your own skills. That could be maybe improve some skills that you already had before or in the best of the cases developing a new one. Using the last example that I used, when I star to learn English I remember that my speaking was the most hard part for me, because is hard to think a word first in Spanish and then traslate that word in to English and also spell that word correct just on your mind. Sometimes I started a sentence but then I couldn't finish it. That was so embarrassing for me, but with the time that problem has been decreased not all, but now is not like the begin. Sometimes that happend to me again when I'm doing presentation or when I'm imfront of nwe people that i have never met. But I feel that the practice has been helping me to decrease that problem and now is easier for me to speak with some body in English at school or in my job . Even if you feel bad or embarrassing to fail with the time that will help. You can be improving skills or even descoviring new ones while you fail that is part of the whole proccess of reach success.

Maybe for some people the fact of fail is the worst thing that can happend to them in the proccess to reach success some of them could say,"" You have to do perfect if you want to reach your goals,"" but I think that we can not do perfection without failure. Failure is a big and les't say importnat part of reach success. Have you ever heard the words , "" No pain, No gain,""

I like that words, because reminds me how good feels when you reach a goal in wich you speend a lot of time or maybe hard work.

For example, when you have a big test at school and you have been studing for that test all nigths for a week or even more and the day of the test you know all the anwers for that test and you got an A or A+ as a grade that feels so good and comfortable to you. Just because of your hard work you are getting all this good grades that you gain by yourself. That is one of the best sensations that you can ever feel or experiment. Using my example agin I can say that all the result of my hard work that I have done helping me to get good gains in my English developing .

Not matter howmany times you fail the last feeling is best in the world. Because is the result of all your hard work. Sometimes I remember how hard was for me to star school in a differnt country, but when I see that I'm about to garduate and get my High School diploma it reminds me all the hard work that I have done during this almost 2 years that I have studing here in Generic_School.

It could sound bad when you hear the word failure or fail when your trying to reach a goal, but if you think we should see all the forms that this words have. Success is not all about fail there is more. We have to go deeper into that words. As I said fail is a big and important part in the way to reach a goal. Success is a big proccess with branches and one of this branches is the failure. But failure give us more than we think. it give us experience that could prepare us for future problems or future goals, it also prepare or improve your skill and even if you don't have one you could descover one that you didn't notice, and finally, but no less important the comfortable feeling that give you at the end is incredible because remind you all the hard work that you have done. So I think if you don

't want to lloss enthusiasm during the proccess of reach success you shouldn""t see the word failure as it is you should go deeper in to try to understand the important role that it plays in the pursuit of success. I just mencion three reasons here but there could be more than three just don't think that just because you fail is the end of the world instead see how failure could help you to reach that important goal your or success. I hope all the time that I've fail in my English speaking will help me to in the future became in a perfect bilingual speaker having my home lenguahge Spanish and my new home lenguage English.

E48441F53011,"Having a homework club after school isn't just a great way for students to get hel on homework but for many other reasons. These are my reasons on why I think having a homework club is beneficial.

Students don't just get help on their homework,but gives them a better understanding on the subject. Students also finish their homework and get a good grades on it.

Staying afterschool can encourage students to try harder on homework and school work as well. Staying for homework club can also make students to be more productive then going home and not getting homework done.

The homework club isn't just beneficial for students but as well as for teachers. Teachers can see questions that many students had a hard time on and then go over it. teachers find it useful to see questoions many students have a hard tim on so that they can practice. Teachers feel good about students finishing their homework and understanding the subject better.

In conclusion I think having a homework club is a great thing because students get a better understanding and getting their homework done. It encourages students to do better in school ,and it is very beneficial for teacher as well.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0

E566F0D20F98,"I don't think it would benefit students to attend classes from home by online such as video conference Why? because they would get distracted by anything else at home and also they wouldn't have the chance to experience what it would be like in school.

If they attend school from home how would they get things done at home? they have the chance to do something else other then school work because they are going on their time. They also are not supervised with teacher like they would at school. They could easily get answers when it comes to tests and quizzes so where would the challenge be when you could just do that. When you are at school you are supervised so there is no looking up answer,you actually have to study to accomplish things. You could easily get distracted by things at home even say I dont want to do it anymore and I feel like thats the risk it would take if students are allowed to take classes at home online.

Students also would miss the chance to experience what it would be like in school. The chance to meet new people, make friends,and just simple socialize with other peers. It would also help students for the real world because when you work you can't do it from home on a computer. You actually have to show up to work and work with others. You also miss the chance to do other things that you would in school that you can't at home like join a club or play a sport and actually do so much that you can't at home. Have that motivation to wake up and go to school and challenge your self and prepare yourself for the world. When you are at home,wouldn't you get board being home all day instead of being at school and just enjoying it. Yes it's a struggle waking up early in the morning to go to school but also it's boring staying home and missing all the things you can do and learn at school with friends and teachers.

I understand why some students would consider taking classes from home maybe they have a personally reason or they can't keep up and rather take their time at home but for that reason you would have to do your best and not get distracted. Being home may help them do better then at school I understand but I think you miss a lot and all the experience that you could get at school. I personally don't think it would benefit missing all that and knowing how it would be. When you get a job that you dont have the option to do it home in the computer so how would you learn and know what it's like.

Therefor I don't think students would benefit from attending classes at home by online or video conferencing.

E56D7CC27444,"Some people believe that glorifying a student's work might help them build self-steem, even when they have not put a lot of effort into it. They believe that students should be confidents in themselves in so they can learn. Others believe that glorifying a student's work that does not have a lot of effort into it lowers their levels of learning. They believe that in order to build self-steem they must complete achievements. I believe that students do not need others to praise their work, even when they did not put enough effort into it. It would make students think that what they did is perfect and that they do not need to work more on it or to do some more effort to achieve what they want. Although some people might not agree. They would think that it is a good thing to glorify students work only to make them feel confident. However, I firmly believe that students should put effort on what they do and that they do not need other people to praise their work only to make the feel confidents with themselves.

One reason I believe students do not need to be praised on their work is because it would only make them rely on what they have and not work to achieve more results. They will not do more of what they are capable of. In addition, they will not put more effort on what they need to do. They do not need others to praise their work only to make them feel confident with themselves. Finally, students will always need others to tell them what they did is amazing to raise their self-steem. This matters because there are people who still believe that praising a student's work will help them to be self-consident.

Second reason I believe that students do not need to other people to glorify their work is beacause it would make them think that everything they do is correct. Students will think that they are not capable of doing more than what they believe they can do. For example, they will always check their work with others only to feel confident with what they did. In addition, I think it is best to tell students that they need to be confident with themselves instead of praising their work. FInally, students do not need others to praise their work in order to be self-confident. This is importan because people have to tell students that they need to be self-confident, even when what they did has not their best effort.

Third reason I believe that achievement is the key to build self-steem is because only achieving what we want we can feel confident with ourselves. I think that to build self-steem we must put a lot of effort to achieve what we have to do. Students need to achieve what they have to do in order to be self-confident. This matters because students should know that they need to work hard and that means to put their best effort, if they want to build self-steem.

In conclusion, I believe that people should not praise the students work only to help them build their self-steem. Sometimes they have not put their best effort in their work. They are going to feel that they are always doing exactly what they needed to do, even if is not like that. In order to be self- confident students must do achievements. However, some people will not agree with my opinion and they will say that it is best to tell students that their work is well done, even when is not only not to make them feel bad or to damage their self-steem.",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0
E57E60E07425,"Conserving Energy and Resources

To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? Conserve energy and resources through this model could be a helpfully way for the school. It can be a support form for the community area. Following this model by extending the school day two hours can be method to conserve energy and resources.

First, conserve energy and resources through extend the school day two hours, the school can give necessary resources for whom need those resources in the community. For example, in the community close to the school live some families with not much resources. They do not have money for pay the energy or buy needs as water or food. The only way that they can have resources as energy is through a big building as a school in the community. In other words, if the school follow this model by extending the school day two hours can conserve energy and resources and give to the community as a needs. Thus, through follow the model by extending the school day two hours, the school can give necessary resources for whom need it in the community.

Second, conserve energy and resources through the model by extending the school day two hours can be helpfully for the school in emergency situations. For example, at Generic_City occurred a strong earthquake at the beginning of this year. Generic_School was one of the school which adopted and follows the model to conserve energy and resources, as a result they were supported in their necessities in this disaster. In other words, by extending the school day two hours and conserve energy and resources ,they were supported with this conserved energy and resources in this emergency situation. Thus, conserving energy and resources following the model by extending the school day two hours can be a helpfully way for emergency school situations.

Conversely, some people may claim that follow this model by extending the school day two hours would not conserve energy and resources because the school will still consuming this energy and resources with this two more hours. However, it can be true, but to retake my point, following this model by extending the school day two hours would conserve energy and resources. It could be helpful for community needs and emergency situations in the school area. This conserve energy and resources could be a way to support the school and the community. Therefore, adopting the model by extending the school day two hours can be a helpfully method to support the school area and the community.

E6122E9ABFA3,"Are first impression almost impossible to change? Most people would say no, but actually it is possible. You just need willingness, hard work, and a litle of confidence.

First of all, if you want to change any first impression, you have to will it. You need to have a vision of how you want to change it. Most people try to change their first impression, but the thing is they don't have a vision. Without a vision you are going nowhere, you most have a vision. Lots of people give up but I know you can do it, because failure is not an option. Always remember will is power.

Second of all, willing something is just the first part to change our first impression. The hard work is probably the most complicated, becasue is where you gonna find some challenges. Challenges are part of life, so don't see them as impossibles, but see them as oportunities. You have to work hard to reach your goal, no matter what. Keep this in mind life is not fair, so you better keep doing and don't look back of what have you done. Always have a clear vision og what you do.

Finally, this is probably the most importamt part, confidence. Confidence plays a big roll to change our fisrt impresion. If your not a cofident person, it migth be hard for you to change but not impossible. You can take classes to gain cofidence like me which is helpful. I'm not cofident person but took the JROTC class which has help me to be more confident amd not olny that, I have learned to be a leardership too. If I can do it, that mean you can. Don't let anything to stop you.

If i am about to do something that i can get in a big trouble for should ask my parents or other adults for an advice.

I would ask different people for an advice, because i can understand something i could do better.

If i am going to do something really bad in school i should think about consequences that will be and ask someone or more people if it is going to be worth of doing.

my opinion is depending the sittuation. For example people can learn from there dicision but in other hand listening to people's advice can stop you from doing wrong. Ever since i was little i always wanted to make my own decision and wont have to listen to no one but i the more i got older i realized that sometimes what people say to do can turn out to be better then the decision you took. Making your own decision can make you more independent and know how life works and those are the people we look up too. Depending on the situation your in listening to others give us life lesson can be one of the most unforgetables momments because that show you they care and want the best for you because maybe they didnt end up making the right decision and want you to prevent from doing it .

E6CF2D3B4FA2,"Examples are what makes a readers/audiences be able to get attracted with what the reason the writer is talking about. Since I have used examples in many things things in my life, I personally think that they could help you with a topic that other people are trying to talking about. And since the question is basically asking if ""examples are good to influences people that are trying to do something or does examples are useless and are not really helpful at all?"" I said that Examples are good to influence other people. And here are the reasons why it is a good influential if you are striving for a long- term goal.

Not many reasons are able to support what you are trying to basically explain or prove. What made me think of this is because if you put a reason that isn't strong enough to even support what you are saying, then basically a reason isn't strong enough if you are trying to influence someone. Like for example, if the topic says that anyone can become famous and the reason is ""work hard and never give up."" that really isn't strong enough to influences someone that actually wants to become that type of guy. But if you put a real life example like ""this person name Generic_Name that was a low-class, lives in a 1 bedroom apartment, and makes not a lot of money. And he heard that he can become a rich person. So he was working hard and he saved up on investment. And somehow he actually became the person that he wanted to be."" that is a example that could be used if you are trying to persuade someone.

Examples can be kept as like a precious thing for people. Why this is also important is because if you actually lets say achieve something that you wanted to accomplish for such a long time. You can always remember that thing that made you kept pushing forward, and to never let down what you wanted to do for such a long time. Like for example, a person named Generic_Name made his dream become a reality; which it was to become a architect that works under a famous person. And when he had to make a speech, he remembered a women who was going through exactly the same thing he was going through. And he said that her life will be something he is going to cherish forever because her background is what made him become who he is now. Which everyone can look at for being influenced by this person right here.

Examples can actually change many peoples lives because of what they say or just their background. What made me choose this reason? well it was because for the past 16 years of my life, I have always seen many people change their lifestyle because of what people are saying to change them. Like for example, when I was in 8th grade, I had a science teacher that was really nice to everyone and respected them as if we were like his child. And all of the students asked him ""why did you decide to become a science teacher?"" And his response was ""I became a science teacher because I like teaching about sciences and the life of our society. And because of a man that i was inspired by. And everyone knows who this guy is? His name is Bill Nye The Science Guy. The reason why i choose him was because during my time when i was in collage , he was the only person that i knew that actually did science. And I wanted to watch his show. And I was amazed by all the chemicals, types of rocks, everything that has to do with science. And since that happened, i have enjoyed being a science teacher for 10 years."" And this speech shows that people will not be able to reach their goal unless you have a motivational quote, speech, or background of a famous person.

While i do think that Examples are good to influence other people that are trying to reach their goal, I still kind of personally think that there are examples that don't really help/influence people. Why I think of that is because people don't find examples of influential that aren't interesting or appealing to them at all because it's doesn't suit them. Like for example, there was a kid who wanted a game that could make him play it all the time. And he saw a commericial about a game that is coming out next week, and he was getting suprised at first, but when he saw a interview about the game, he wasn't really amazed anymore because what the game director talked about wasn't influencing other poeple at all. So there are some examples that really can't influences them. But most of the time, there are so many examples that are out there in the world that actually changed peoples lives, and their mind about something. ",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5
E70DD00622DB,"From my personal experience back in middle school, I had to use technology for many different reasons. One of the reasons were for research purposes. I was able to use technology as a tool to provide information on my assignments and projects. So far technology has made a positive effect in my life not only in school but in real life. Technology has helped me accomplish and complete many difficult task in life. I believe that technology has made a positive effect on people's lives; consequently, it makes peoples lives a lot easier and convenient.

One reason that technology has a positive effect on people is that they are able to study without having to go out on a library and pay for books or a tutor to teach them. For example, people who are disabled or unable to travel out of their houses are able to go online and research for books and look for a site to teach them what they need to learn. The availability to go online and research for information also helps students who are too busy to go outside and ask others for help. Many schools started providing laptops and iPad's to students who are unable to connect online. Schools are using these electronics because they provide an easier way to help student learn and complete work.

Technology can also help people do many other things online other than researching for information.

Furthermore, technology may also be used as a way to shop whatever and whenever. For example, eBay and amazon is an online shopping website for many things such as: furniture, clothes, food, and many other reliable things. This has made it a lot easier for people to purchase items that they want at any time. Online shopping helps a lot of people who are looking for items that cannot be found in local stores. For example, many custom equipment's and items can only be found online and in places that may not even be located in your place. Not only does technology may be use as an online tool, it may also used as a way to communicate to others in the world.

Lastly, communication has been a major part of the world; in addition, technology has been one of their ways to communicate. For example, our military has improved a lot throughout the years due to the inventions of many technologies. Technologies such as: cellular devices, radar, satellite and many other communicating tools has helped us win wars and accomplish many things around the world. Another reason why technology has had a positive effect on people is that they use it for emergency purposes. For example, if an adult needs to call out of work for the day because of family problems, he may use his cellular device to call and inform his supervisor about it.

Many people say that technology is a way to showcase yourself as a lazy person and I disagree with that. I believe that technology allowed many people to accomplish and complete many task. Technology is not only important to the civilians who are either students or adults who are working in the industry, but it is also important for the military who are using these tools to provide protection to our country and keep our people safe. In conclusion, technology has had a positive effect on people's lives and that is due to many reasons such as online researching, online shopping, and wide spread communication.

E738D8E24101,"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something,or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Students should be active in all the school year even for the intire life. I belive that be active help us to increase our skills and the practice made an expert. In the other hand,others belive that be inactive can result good and help them to don't become tired and old to fast. The people do more accomplish if they are always doing somenthing,students who practice sports can become better they have more resistence,and Moreover,Stay active can help us to be more profecional even in a jod. Exercise help our body to stay healthy.

However not everyone is agree with this position. Some people belive that stay inactive is more accomplish because doing the same thing can become bored,Doing nothing doesn't help us to progress and be success for the intire life,The students who don't practice any sport or are not involve in any school program have more time to study and rest their maind that can result good in their final grade.

Forthemore,be active help us to increase our skils and the practice made an expert because if we are always active in what the teacher tell us to do at school,we can increase and be more and more faster the next time,that also can help to find a job because every boss want a good worker, and also that give us a good reffert because anyone can say good things about us depending on what we have done do far at schools,even outside the school like comunity service.

In addition,students who practice sports can become better because they can have more resistence and their body is healthy,also they can be hard worker in the future because their body is already made to bear that,practice sports at the schools is good because students recive credits for that and a reward if they win,that can give us new experiences and fun time also makes new friends who like to be active like me and others students around the country and around the world.

Moreover,sleep good and having the hours to rest help us to be active the next day don't feeling tired and sleepy because the students have to wake up early on the morning and gives all what they have at the school,everyone want to be a good student and pass the tests and everything,also be active depend in how much energy we have thats way we have to eat on the morning to have energy and be active the all day.

Finally,it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something because we can get our goals working hard,students making goals to the end of the school year, stay active help to makes goals and get what we want to the of the school year,stay active can include be participate en class,colarate in a school proyet,sport team,drama,school announcement and everything that involve school learning,after Hig School or in the collage,be active helps to go to the collage because we can get a Beca for our work in Hing School.

Overall,stay active is more accomplish and help us to the entire life and make us better now and in the future because if we do the things rigth,we can earn more money when we start to work,stay active not only benifit us also the people around us because they can see us that we never stay in one place thats mean we are not conformist a person or student who want to overcome their self.

If the students don't do that job they might be in a big problem. in SCHOOL_NAME if the students do not turn theirs phone off and it rings during class the teachers automatically will take the phone from the students.

Eventually the parents have to come and get the phone from school and give them to their kids.

If the students bring their phones to school they will text their friends, call their friends and take pictures.

In contrast if the students are doing those jobs during classes and there were no school rules the students would play with their phone during class time.

During class time students might listen to their favorite songs on their phone and don't pay attention to the teacher which they will get a worst citizenship in their report card and they will not graduate and they will feel sad and shocked about what they have done to hurt them.

Or someone make a bomb and try to put it in street. and also is danger because maybe someone drank a lot and he drove the car maybe can hit anybody by the car that's why the police check the city a lot of time to make sure no bad things will happen and also the police check the city because if someone have something wrong they will help them. if the teenagers don't break the law this will help the police to try make the city safe the safety in city is so important. Like example that happen with me when I was 15 years old I was walking in the street at 11 p. m. and I was going to my home I see one man behind me but I thought is regular man but he was have a knife and he said to me give anything you have I was have my wallet had on it my ID and not too much money and I don't have anyone in the street to help me and he took my phone and he told me leave and don't look behind you I ran away because he was almost gonna kill me. be in your home early to be safe. The police doesn't want to control on you but he want to be safely. because the world is not safe now the world have a lot of bad people. And also I was have my friend was in street at 1 a. m. and someone was drank and hit my friend by the car. And my friend is dead all of these to show you how the world is not safe. the police have a lot of situations with the bad people. and if you look at the countries is not safe the reason is because every day around the country you will find everyday someone killed. That's tells you how the world is not safe. a lot of people dead because of the people is drank or the someone have a gun or knife. if you search in internet about the people is succeed in their life the internet will show you these people focused in their future when they finish their work the going to their home to take a rest. try to make your schedule early like in the mid day in the morning to go to your home early.

E81B50098AAC,"In my opinion students should come to school. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students,which allows the students to be irresponsibles and not to show their work to the teacher. As we can see taking classes online is not a good option to us, for instance if we dont make the time to attend the classes online, or by the time we are taking the online classes we received a text for friend we stop doing what we are doing and got distracted by the electronic devices and, others words if we come to school received classes we are going to be able to get the knowledge that we need to be great in our academic life.

I consider myself that taking online classes is not a good option for students. Some students that take online classes are procrastinators,they dont care about their homework, or they wait until the last minute to do it. The truth is, if we dont take our online classes seriously how we are going to learn. For example,

My friend Generic_Name is taking online classes and she said that taking online classes allow her to be irresponsible by not doing her homework.

Some students dont make the time to take the online classes and we just forget to take it. I wonder how we are going to learn if we dont make the time to do it. Sometimes we got distracted for something that have nothing to with the class that we are taking. However, if we have a job and we got home late, and in our mind is to get home and take the online classes, but when we get home we are so tired and we just want to go to bed, and forget about what we have to do.

The last and more important reason what we should take classes in school is, if we attend to school,we can ask questions to the teacher and he can provides us with a powerful answers and specific examples, if we attend to school that will helps us to get a responsibility to be every day at school and not to miss any important class, and also that would gives the knowledge that we would need to be great in life.

In final consideration I think students should come to school and take our classes, that way we would learn more better than taking it in online, and also that we will makes us more responsible. As we take the classes in school we will get the knowledge that we would need to success in our academic life in general we would be great in our professional life.  ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5

I think that positive attitude is the key to be successful in life because if you show positive attitude to someone it will make your day better and theirs too, when you show negative attitude about something you always fail, and having negative attitude can also effect your mental health.

Although showing positive attitude can not solve someones problems, but it sure makes their day better, But if you show negative attitude to someone it will make their day worse. Having positive attitude can give you a lots of opportunity in life. and having positive attitude can also prevents you from failing in life.

Many people fail in life because they always show negative attitude, for example if you show positive attitude at work you will have coworkers and boss who appreciate your positive attitude. You will be successful because you are not worry, or stress about it. But if your show negative attitude about it you will lose the job and fail which can cause depression. Having negative attitude in life not only make you fail in life, but also make you not try it again because you are too scared to fail again which can be very effective one your mental health. although being positive does not solve all of your problems, but it will help your mental health.

Some teens in high school are always worried, depressed, and desperate because they always show negative attitude to teachers' and their friends'. Which effects their mental health. Having negative attitude can prevent you from having friends' and it can also prevents you from having good teachers' who help you in test. Which can cause you fail the class and not graduate high school. Which will impact on your health.

E83BE2C46D0D,"In some schools they have a program that pairs older student with younger student. The older student are available to assist the younger student in order to succeed on their goal. ""Aww man, I **** hate this, I don't know how to make this spaghetti and meatball sandwich I had the wheat bread, the sauce, manssreala cheese, spaghetti and my meatballs what else in this world am I missing. Did you know that 50% of the population of older student have often fail because of lack of communication and the other half is lack of knowledge. I believed, If older student help the younger kids they will they both will succeed in different things. For example, communicating more helps the older student talk to the younger ones more often. For the younger ones they will understand their conflict and what they need to work on.

Learning to communicate more helps the older student talk to the younger ones more often. For the younger ones they will understand their conflict and what they need to work on. I learn my mistake because one of the older student name Generic_Name, help me with a problem involving math and science. Generic_Name love math and would love to help me, their were a lot of steps I need to do it was only five minutes when he was done, but it felt like an eternal. I understand why I was wrong and what I need to do in order to get it right. From my point of view I knew he was having trouble communicating with me because he was studding a lot and made mistakes. We both learn a lesson that nobody is perfect the first time. I love the quote that Leon Missie said at the convention. He said ""Nobody Is Perfect The First Time, and remember that everyone has a talent or skill."" That means everyone has made a mistake more than once and try to fix it."" I remember the time I did a terrible mistake, I was in a chemistry class In Generic_School I was doing in a experiment, I had to put on my safety first. I over did with the salt a little bit. In a dangerous chemical called La Muete, which means that it is poisonous, so the becker exploded in to a million pieces and all I saw was fire on my cloth and on the teacher desk .The teacher quickly got the fire extinguisher and put it on me first and then the fire form letting spread more and boy I got my **** kick by my mom and dad so hard that they made me pay for all the damage I created. So my teacher got me an assist too help me with the calculation so I don't mess up again. Eventually, I pass the class with a B-, I was relief that it was over and I won't do that chemical bond ever again.""

Often successes can help both young and older student. Sometimes the older student can make a mistake too and teach the younger student. That it is okay if you made a mistake, but make sure that you don't know something don't leave it blank just try and figure out what missing because the assist won't be there all ways. Life dosen't work like that, their are thing that we have to figure out on our own. My job is teach you what the problem that your stuck on and me learning how to communicate with others and you learning your problems, and trying to fix them.""I remember when I got my license at the age 21 and yes that means I crash a lot, turning in the wrong direction, and even broken into people yards. Yes, it really hard driving and I had this final attempt that if I don't pass then I don't ever get my license even when I really old. So I study hard and where i'm I supposed to go, stop when the light is red, Break when something is moving in the road, read the speed limit, park in a specific position ,and most importantly turn on the signal. I had an assist or should I say my friend Generic_Name, was with me and telling me what to do. I thought I was going to crash in to someones yard again but not this time, I was driving pretty go actually .So the day had come and I need to relaxed and not think about failing, and them my family will laugh at me for not passing, and I had to live with my parents all the time just because I can't drive. I stared to do go and the instructor showing me where to turn. After a few hours had passed I barely had passed with a C- and that not to go and not to bad. I had my license and my life was going go too.

To sum it all up, all over the world school have a program called ""Two is better than One"" it a program that allows older student assist the younger student in order for them to succeed in the conflicts there having trouble on It helps both old and younger students. It helps the older student to communicate more with people and so on and so forth. When the older student learn how to communicate with others they with eventually learn to help or talk to strangers more often. Failure can eventually lead to successes, like my driving license, I fail lots of times but that never stop me from getting my driving license. From that chemistry class that I almost took the whole school down with me. From that final attempt I learn that no matter how many time you fall there will always be a way to succeed. But there will be time were you need someone assist so they can help you.

Also your forming you body in general, which makes you stay fit, fresh, and always hydrated which is good for your health.

Everybody starts from going from different clubs and parks, where you could start going from your community. Then the state and then national parks, provide you greater opportunities and that's were the journey begins. I like to think that activities generally sports develop your body in a sort of way, that it can also develop your brain into knowing more knowledge of that sport and knowing every detail of it. Neseceraily, not only physical effects can happen to your typical common general body muscles, but having an understanding of the game can be outstanding which requires critical thinking that can affect your organ brain in a good way . If you get to see chess not considered really a sport ,but an activity that exercises your mental thinking, others find this game or other games interesting too and really find the complexity of the game and thats how legends form in any type of game.

The community and people are starting to know each other better by Community activities along everywhere State communities, and National communities. If you asked people that do activities everyday, they will say almost everyone in the world, ounce upon a while everyone did a activity. Since, is what forms your body's growth, shape,and knowledge. The main thing is that there is activities for everyone, that everyone can be good at something and they can have a good time, on what they're doing.",3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,4.0,3.0
E88DDF2C81EB,"I believe that positive attitude is the key to success in life. What I mean by that is being nice and giving a good feedback to the things and actions people do and say. We can show how matured we are. We can be examples for others that are living with us too.

I have a friend and her name is Generic_Name. She plays a lot of sport and one of the sport she plays was soccer. Generic_Name's team always losses and she use to tell her team that it will be fine and that they just need more practice. The next Saturday they are having a game. All her team mates are scared because they are positive that they are gone be losing with out even being at the game. Generic_Name told them losing is not the end of the world and being scared does not help them to wine the game. At the end they all promised to each other even if they dont wine that they will be happy to be able to play.

On the other side there is my little brother Generic_Name. He is 12 years old. He never liked math. I always try to help him do his home work. One day I saw his test and he had them all right. I was not surprised because he was working so hard. Whenever he gets his answers wrong he wold say that its fine. I will do it again. After he came home he said his teacher gave him candy and that he gave it to his friend. I was so amazed. I couldnt wait to ask why. He said because his friend was studying so hard and did not get any candy he felt bad.

over all positive attitude is the key to success. Whenever we dont fell like we are having negative energy we should ask and understand that it could get worse. By positive altitude we could get more that we lose if we are having negative attitude.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
E8B0698217A3,"They say the you should never judge a book by its cover and, especially regarding people, its true. In this case, the cover is not necessary meaning the appearance, but the first impression of another person. Like the cover of a book, first impressions are not always as appealing as what is really there. its not until after you start ""reading"" or get to know someone, when you really find out that what you see is not always what you get. There are several factors that can affect the first impression that one receives from another. Differing personality, situations and representation of a person, make impressions often the worst means of judging people.

A person's personality has a big effect on the first impressions that they emit. Everybody is different but when it comes down to it first impressions are really based off of whether you are shy or not. I met my best friend after moving during my junior year, at my new high school. Before i knew her, she never said a word to me or anyone else in the classes that she was kind of odd, but then realized that I was the same way, i didn't talk to many people either because of my personality. I knew that I was shy person and after I get to know someone, I put down my front and show my true colors. I thought that maybe she would be same way. After starting to talk to her a little more each day, our friendship grew and I learned that she wasn't odd at all, but just like me an outgoing person hidden by their shyness. Some people like me and my friend, are shy and put up a reserved and quiet front when facing new people. Based on my first impressions of my friend, I thought something that was far from the truth. One who has a shy personality might in reality be outgoing, but uncomfortable showing it at first, making the first impression of that person a mistaken one.

Your first impression of someone is not suitable because you do not know the situation they may be in. When seeing or meeting someone new, you have no idea the kind of day,

difficulties or kind of disappointment that person may be experiencing. They may have have recently lost someone, or could be someone new and yet still have to deal with the routines and stresses going through out their day. All of these situations can create a barrier between themselves and others, and setting of a good impression is probably not at the top of their list of important things to do.

On my first day of senior year, I walked hurriedly to my first class, even thought I had plenty of time to get there. When I walked into my class, the only thing on my mind was to find a seat right away, no matter if it was by another person or not. when the time come to eat lunch, I sat by myself and ate it quickly so I could proceed to my next class. I was so worried about being late for a class, finding a seat and just doing things right, that i didn't have time to try to leave any good first impression, on any of my peers. It wasnt even on my mind to do so. My peers received the impression that i was nervous and not a sociable person, when really I was acting the way I was because of the situation that I was in.

There are many factors that lead to someone's first impression of another. Someone;s personality, current situation, or the way they happen to present themselves all influences the way someone thinks about another when seeing or meeting them for the first time. Since what they think is based off of these judgments, their first impressions is usually wrong. If all friendships were based on first impressions, there would be a lot less of them in the world. First impressions are more often worst means of judging a person because its not until you get to really know a person, you are better equipped to understand what kind person they truly are, and really know the individual based on real values, rather than their first impression or ""book cover"".",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5

I think it is wrong for you to not let students with a C grade average to participate in sports or any fun activity! I think every student should be able to participate in sports and/or any other activity because the majority of the students here are still passing with a C. Also, it would be fair to any other student here to participate. Many students like to play sports such as Basketball, Baseball, Soccer, Volleyball, and much more! Also if they are not really interested into Sports they would love to go in Clubs such as a Recycle club, Art, Reading, Computers, and more! Many students would actually improve they're grades to keep on participating in sports or clubs. I really think you should let us students join.

E8E60E149B48,"New ideas always help us in life. Some people think people should make their on decisions, it's easy to see both sides, but one stands out people should seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters, because new ideas can help us decide something and guidance help us when we're confused to make that decision.

First, new ideas can help us decide something that we're not sure to decide. Guidance can explain what you want; they can tell us what is better for us or if something going to work. Guidance is really help full in life, if we didn't have guidance in our life would be a little hard for decide things. New ideas can help you decide something.

next, guidance help us when we're confused to make decision or don't know what to do. Guidance can help in our future and they help you decide witch idea is better for you and for your future. They always know what is better for us.

The other side, some people think that we should make our on decision, it make since, because it make us have responsibility and always know what we want, but what if you do the wrong decision and you can't change the decision, because you already choose it. That's why people can't make decision alone.

Concluding, people should choose guidance, not just choose your own idea or talk about it with someone because you can make the wrong decisions. New ideas can make people think more and make a good idea. Always think twice before make your own decision.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.5
E96C123FAC95,"CHOOSE YOUR OWN CHARACTER

The British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote,""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""Do we choose our own character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control? Take a position on this issue. Do we need to choose are own character traits yes, or no? In my opinion I will say yes we need choose our character because If we choose our character we can be wherever we want, good,or bad person, etc and we are going to do a good job if we choose our own character traits.

First, If I choose my own character I will give my best work because I choose my own character, and I'm going to feel very comfortable, and so happy to do it my character. For example, I remember one friend from my country hi's name were Generic_Name and he was doing a activity school was theater, and they were doing the story of Little Red Raiding Hod, and he was acting the wolf he was the bad gay, and he did a really good job I was so impressed, I remember he say in the stories I always I'm going to be the bad guy because the bad guy is the second most important character, and is the conflict of the story the one who make interesting the story.

Next, you can develop and demonstrate your skill acting, If you choose your own character because you are going to do a great work, and you are going act like you are a real actor and maybe you can discover acting, If have a passion of acting. For example, I hear some stories about actor. How they like acting, and they say in the first time they didn't liked to act but them there was starting like how they act, that how they like to acting because it's fun to act, and you can enjoying acting with your friends.

Finally, If I do one character I don't like, or I don't choose probably I'm not going to give my best work because I'm not going to feel comfortable or exacting to do it. For example, I remember like 3 years ago In my English 9 class we do a act about Romeo And Juliet and they give my the character of the guard and I was not exacting to do it, so I didn't do very well but I try I think If I try maybe I will like the character but I didn't liked that why I prefer to choose my own character.

In conclusion, If you choose your own character you are going to do a good job and great work, you are going to demonstrate and develop your skill acting If you do the character you choose, and if you do a character you did choose you probable are not going to do a great job, or maybe you are not going care about the character this are the reason why is good to choose a character them someone give you a character. So remember choose your own character don't wait Intel someone give you a character,and don't forget is telling you the one who wrote the article. >_<",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0
E974548BFD00,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered,you will never grow"". Doing something that you have already mastered means that you won't grow. I agree with what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote because it is always good to try new things. Would you want to try something new and master it or keep doing the same thing?

First, people can challenge themselves with new things so they can experience life with obstacles. Challenging themselves means that they will try to do something even when its hard. Challenging people with hard things means that they are not going to give up even when it gets hard. Why wouldn't you want to challenge yourself with new things?

It's good to try new thing because doing something that you have already mastered is good but what about trying to master something else. If you want to grow even more it would be better to step out of your comfort zone and experience new things.

Also, Having more experience with life means that you are growing up. Growing up means that you would have to try new things and not only stick to one subject. Wanting to try new things in life is good because your brain functions better and you get more knowledge. You will have more knowledge in your brain which means that you could master more and more things. Mastering something is good because you get to have more self esteem and you will feel good about yourself. Feeling good about your self is really important because you will need the motivation to master something in life. You can't master anything without having motivation because then it will be a mess and it wont turn out good.

Therefore, wanting to try new things is good because you can be open minded. You can also have many ideas that you could jot down. Wanting to try new things gives you a lot of ideas on what you want to master. In the process of thinking of an idea to master you get so excited that there is a lot of planning and ideas in your head on what to master in. It is always good to feel confident because without confidence and motivation you wont have the energy to do what you originally wanted to do in the first place. Trying new things is also good for your social life because you will come in contact with people that has so many creative ideas and you can talk to them and they would probably help you on what your ideas can be.

However, not challenging yourself with new thing,having more experience with life,and wanting to try new things may not be good you could end up being comfortable at where you are at. Being comfortable is good but not challenging yourself to do whats best is bad because your not giving yourself enough credit. If you don't work hard to master something that you truly want to master in then there is no point in trying to master it. If you dont try to master in anything you wont have any hope and you will become lazy and you will stop trying the hard work that you are trying to do. Trying new things is apart of life and if you don't do that than you would struggle a lot in life.

In conclusion, challenging yourself,having more experience with life,and wanting to try new things is better than being comfortable at where you are at in life, being lazy,stop trying,and don't want to try new things which means that you will start struggling in life. having new experiences is better than only having old experiences because with new experiences you have a fresh start and a clean plate. You get to have a better life because you're going to be having a lot of things that you would want to master. Giving up is never the right thing because than you wont get anything you want. You have to work in order to get what you want because life doesnt give you anything for free. Many people want to grow and do other things so that they can master at it. Wouldn't it be cool if you were the first person to master anything you wanted? ",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
EA105A8B8699,"I agree because in life you can achieve many goals and pass through so many good things like me i always think positive thats why so many good things happen to me also never disagree because in life you never know what could actually really happen maybe something bad that you have no clue about . Life is great if you keep a positive attitude for example give people advice on somethig good maybe one day they will do the same for you be greatfull with what you have or get beacsue soem people dont have what you have and they really want . Thats why i always have a postive attitude beacuse when i make good discissions i get what i want.

Here are some examples of why you shoud agree for example you get a job a costumer comes by needs help you give them a positive attitude they will give you a positive attitude to help eachother out give them respect talk to them nicely you never know something good could happen second of all what could happen if you give them a bad attitude they will give you the same attitude to. Look at the bright side what happens when you them a positive attitude and they give you a bad attitude you keep the same attitude no matter what they will see and think to their head wow he or she has a nice attitude while the perrson is giving them and ungreatfull attitude.

Always be the bigger person with great attitude even if the person is having a bad day probably try to give them a positive attitude and probably you might cheer them up its always good to make people feel good about themselves afterwards you will feel good because you helped them out . Its never a bad thing to have a positive attitude because good things will come to you .",3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,2.5
EA970C38817C,"Do you think people accomplish more if they are always doing something or do you think inactivity serve as a purpose?

Thomas Jefferson wrote,""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.""Many people think that they accomplish more if they are always doing something. When people are always doing something,they are always learning new things and gaining experiences. Some people think that the more they do ,the more they achieve because being idle will not lead you to success and nobody is going to come and accomplish things for you. Therefore much may be done if people are always doing something

Certainly some people think that inactivity serve as a purpose because people can be physically inactive but mentally active and they might be creating wonderful things in their minds. Still others think that being inactive does not mean that they are being idle because they already achieved their dreams and they are satisfied with what they have so that is why they see inactivity as a purpose. Others might think that not everyone have the opportunities to being always doing something and they do not have more option that being inactive.

However, people accomplish more if they are always doing something because they learn new things in the process of doing something. They learn more about themselves and about others. They learn how to interact and connect with others and how to fit in different environments. People who are always doing something gain more and new experiences that will help them later in life also gaining experiences and being in different types of environments surrounded by different kind of people will help them improve their mental maturity and also help them to to have a different perspective of see world and life. In other words people who are always doing something accomplish more,and learn more how to interact with others and gain new experiences.

Furthermore,people accomplish more if they are always doing something because the more you do the more you achieve. If people do not work and make an effort for the things they want to accomplish nobody is going to do it for them because each person is the author of their own success .Some people might be waiting that the things they want fall from the sky ,or appear magically in their hands making no effort to accomplish them and idles will not lead you to success .People who are successful today is because they were always working hard and making their best effort to accomplish their goals,they know what they wanted and they were persistent and did not give up on their goals. If people want to be successful in life they have to know that failure is part of achieving success and just have to keep trying and do not give up until they achieve their goals. Therefore people's success is based on the effort they put to achieve it because the more they do the more they achieve.

In fact, people accomplish more if they are always doing something because they are spending their time in things that really worth it .If people are going to spend time of their life that will never get back they better spend that time doing something that worth it and doing something that is going bring positive ,and good things to their life. Many people spend a lot of time or even their whole life doing things that never brought something positive or good to their life and that is maybe because they never found their passion in life and doing something you are not passionate about it is just a waste of time. Therefore people should spend time following their dreams and doing what they truly love because when they are doing what they are truly passionate about, they will see that every effort they did to accomplish their goal worth the time they spent and the effort they put .As a result when people spend their time always doing something they accomplish more.

In conclusion,people should determine never to be idle and never to conform with what they have. Always work hard and aspire for bigger things ,always try to be successful and do everything and anything to accomplish their dreams, and goals and do not let anyone to tell you that you can not do something because if you believe in yourself you are capable to do everything you want .People should always spend their time in things that worth it, in things that will bring good and positive things to their life .People should be always doing something and that is how they will see what wonderful things can be done by doing always something because the more people do the more they achieve and people who are always doing something are the people who accomplish the more.

Althought some schools think that is better to offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years, actually students should take four years of high school. First students can have more time to learn. For example, in a year students can learn much stuff, and they have energy to learn, in the summer students just have two months to study, so they don't have much time to learn all the stuff they learn at school, in evenings students have three months to study, the classes start a 5pm and end at 7pm, so at that time students are tired and the don't have much energy, so it's difficult to concentrated and learn all the stuff. Second students can have electives, students can have classes like gym, art, and music students can discover new talents in that classes, also students relax their minds in that classes and enjoy the school. Third students can enjoy their summer vacations, students get tired for study ten months, is good that they can relax and pass time with their family and friends, so their mind is clear, and when they start study they have good attitude, energy and they want to learn new stuff. Finally students can have more time to do stuffs, because they can go home and do their homeworks, study for exams, pass time with their family, and have good sleep hours, they don't have to worry about go to school in evenings, they can relax.

EAD2625A1711,"In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Their courses of study In high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. Many young students do not have the capacity of choosing a career at that time of age. I believe, that kinds mentality about their career will change through out high school. Student should not be required to choose a career by the time they enter to high school, because they are inexperienced to know what they want, students could choose the wrong career, and unhappy of wasting their time on a career they are going to change their mind on.

Inexperienced of not knowing what they want,students could make the take wrong choices about their future career. When students enter to high school they are normally around fourteen years old, young students of that age are normally not worry about their future career yet. Students mentality starts changing abut their career when they are having more knowledge about what they really what to be. When kids are around sixteen is when are maturing about their future and looking at things differently. students do not have the capacity of choosing their whole future career at the young of age.

When students are force to choose a career when they first enter to high school, they could choose the wrong career. Most students know that choosing the wrong career could affect the later on in the future. Lets say that they choose a career when they enter to high school, but they are unhappy. They are going to be stuck their whole life time with something that does not makes them happy. When people work with things they like or enjoy they attempt to work harder and better.

Most people change their mind almost everyday about something they like or do not like, well it is the same with choosing a career. Wasting time is something no one likes to do, and specially when is about their future. Making kids choose their career at a young age could mess them up and they would have to do things all over again. When choosing the wrong career, accepting the consequences and restart over again with a new career of their choice. Making good research,planing things out first with a good process will help with their future career.

Most students are not prepare to pick their future career during high school. Most students have no knowledge of what they want to be later in life.

In the future you will do a lot of responsible things. Enjoy it bore it ends.

Everyone goes through something in their life. Everything will get better. Just don't think negative. Always look up never down. Cause if you do look down you won't see your bright future that will come.

Do good things in your life. Like be nice to people don't be rude, disrespectful, and mean. That's not going to help you in life. what's the point of being mean. Don't take your anger out on others. Just because someone else did something to make you mad. Taking your anger out on someone who didn't do anything is not going to help. Its's making the problem worse. Things happen for a reason, Maybe it happens to teach you a lesson.

Don't rush things in your life. Give things time, be patient. You don't know what can happen if you rush things in life. Everything has a time, you just have to wait until it comes. If something happens it happens you can do anything but to hope that things will get better. Life for an example, Lets just say that someone important gets sick.

We need to have hope to learn the lesson.

The more you give hope the more you believe, The less you try everything is completely blind.

For an example, I gave up and stopped trying. But that didn't help. Things got harder for me. I didn't have hope. But then i realized why am i thinking negative? and not trying.

Although some says that determine to be idle or inactivity also serve a purpose in the way of one day they will accomplish something even though they are lazy, and people determine to not be idle when they want to accomplish something and when people decide to not being wasting their time without doing anything, inactivity doesn't serve a purpose in the life and in the way of accomplish something

Determine never to be idle is much better because we accomplish more, we make proud our family when we do something great to our life, I have done many things in school and accomplish many goals in my life so my parents always tell me that I make them feel proud of me for all that I have been done even though they said that it is not that easy but they know that I never determine to be idle and I always like to accomplish something in my life.

I always like to accomplish things like having a better grades in school and learn more each day even though some classes are harder than other once but I like to not be idle because if I determine to be idle I may just waste my time doing nothing.

Determine never to be idle is much better because people can growth having a better future in their life,

people can growth having a better job. For example, I want to growth by studying a career and have a better job in the future. Make more proud my family and myself I know it is hard, but all the effort that I put on it right now it will pay it back later, and I will so be thankful to myself to be a person who never determine to idle in life. And it is wonderful how much I had done I never going to regret about what I had been accomplished.

In conclusion, if people never do something in their life, they never will accomplish something that can be a benefit for their future or make their family proud. As Thomas Jefferson said if people determine never be idle they can accomplish and have done what they want to done in their life, and it is wonderful how much people may have done if they always been doing something and don't determine to be wasting their time.

EBD586EB3AA8,"Schools should not have a four day school because, some students may not have time to stay more hours, some students have a part-time job and others help parents to taking care of younger siblings. However, some people have different points of view by, believing that extending schools days that benefits the energy, resources and even helping students to learnd more. An example, is just having four days work or school week. This adaptation can have good and bad benefits. Some people believe that, havig just four days of school is a bad idea because a student will not have time to work or do other activities. A reason of this is because schools days will be more longer and there is going to be less time for them to do activities, student will not have time to work and help their parents taking care of their siblings.

One of a major idea is students will not have time to do their activities. Since school is going to end late. Students need to finish all school assignments. However, Elementary schools will end later that High schools or Middle schools. That will not letf them much longer for them to pass time with their family. Students will be more eshausted, that can be really worrying because their grades can go down. Parents will not be happy with their kids grades. This adaptation can be really helpfult for some people. However, it can affect some other people lifes.

Another reason is some students have a part-time job. They will no have time to work and even if, they have the time it's going to be difficult for them. An example, if students get out from school late they have to run to their house to get ready to go work because they may be late for work. However, going to work for them is not that easy some of them don't have their license yet. Some of them have to walk even take a public bus. Before considering the benefits of four days of school week there are a lot more disadvantages that can affect students with their normal life.

The last reason is teenagers helps parents with their siblings. Although that can change because if students have to stay more at school their schedules will be longer than a normal. An example, parents will have to find someone that can stay with their kids and that means that is going to be more cost. Parents will be unhappy paying more money to a babysitter. However, is reallly hard to find someone that can be dependable. Even if teenegers have the time to take care of their siblings, they will not have time to do their own stuff because they have to do two things at the same time.

In conclusion, these ten hours school not just affect students will affect the whole family because students will end really eshausted even, teachers will get tired too. After considering all the benefits and disadvantages there is a point about conserve energy and resources that does not make sense, if students get two more hours of school for four day that means that there is not any conserve anergy or resources because we still using the same five days hours in four days instead five days. Reasons why students should not have four day week is because schools days will be more longer and there is going to be less time for them to do activities, student will not have time to work and help their parent taking care of their siblings.",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5
EC2758A5B74E,"Dear School board,

Why does a student's education matter? To me, it is extremely important because it can affect them for their entire life in positive or in negative ways. It could lead them to a job with a seven figure salary, or to work a part-time job at a fast food restaurant making minimum wage. What's also important to me is the learning experience. I believe learning should be fun, interesting, and not stressful for students. That's why I agree with the school board's plan to extend the school day by one and a half hours, because that way, students wouldn't feel rushed and would have more time to learn, teacher will have more time to teach and using new ways, and the school year would be a little shorter.

To begin with, I agree with the school board to extend the school day because students wouldn't feel rushed and they would have more time to learn. Right now, each of our periods are only about 50 minutes, which I think really isn't a lot of time to learn once you start working. If one and a half hours is added to the current school day, we would have at least an hour for each class. This way, the students would have more time to complete projects, assignments, or just have more time to really understand the subject without feeling rushed. I know this because right now, I am working on a project in science class that we only have two class periods to finish, which totals for just about one and a half hours! I am not saying that a little push isn't necessary or beneficial, but the extra time would definitely boost the quality of the student's work at our school without rushing them.

Secondly, I think the school board should increase the school day by one and a half hours because that will let teachers have more time to teach, while using unique ways to do so. With the students having more time to learn, the teachers could potentially also have more time to actually create a better learning experience. Extending the day ensures that teachers would be able to thoroughly explain new concepts and materials, while also teaching using better or more effective methods that wouldn't have been possible because of the shortage of time. For instance, sometimes we have educational scavenger hunts, where the teacher lays the information throughout the campus and we would have to find them. The issue is, we've never been able to finish, not because it wasn't possible to, but because there simply wasn't enough time. Those kinds of educational activities are, in my opinion, very fun, but it's also effective. So if we have more time, I am sure that some teachers would plan and teach more using different ways which are beneficial to both the student and the teacher.

Lastly, the school board's plan to extend one and a half hours to the school day is something I strongly concur with because school will be out earlier in the summer. While I do enjoy school very much, I think summer break is something that everyone looks forward to. The days that are cut down because of the increased time allows students to attend more activities and spend more time together with their families. Even though the students aren't at school, they could still be learning something new on their own. For example, they could be learning how to play an instrument, training for sports, or learning how to speak another language, which are all very helpful for them. Also, the teachers could be attending conferences which let's them collaborate with other teachers on creating newer and more efficient methods to teach, which will help everyone in the long run.

In conclusion, the reasons why I agree with the school board to extend the hours are because students wouldn't feel rushed, teachers would have more time to teach in unique ways, and school will be out sooner in the summer. Although I think there are many more reasons why the school day should be longer, those are the main ones. There are just so many benefits that this extended time would create; possibly having an effect on the entire community. This is not an immense amount of change but it can be a big success, which is why I think you should really consider extending the school hours.

EC8590A774E6,"I think self-esteem comes from real achievement because if you're not doing your best work In class and you feel like its not good enough, and someone tells you what you did wasnt good enough then it will just make you want to do better. On the Other hand If you do try your best and the work you completed is good, and someone gives you a lot of compliments then it helps you build a better self-esteem. Therefore you got to be self confident also, why? because if you're self confident and you apply for a job you will manage to be confident that you will get that job, when you go to an interview. If you practice to be self confident It will help you a lot in the near future. If you got an affinity for a type of shoes and someone else tells you they're ugly how will you feel? Of course you will feel some type of way because that's just how the human body works, but you know what? It dont matter what people think. If you Got an affinity for those type of shoes then it dont matter what people got to say about your shoes. At the end of the day its what you like not what other people like. People will always judge you no matter what you wear, what you look like, and how speak. Always remember that only god can judge you. Therefore you should take the negative stuff that people got to say, and turn them into something positive. That will help you build up better self-esteem because you always got to be yourself no matter what.

ECC9E84CD3D1,"I think that students should start an after school homework club. 3 reasons I think that students should start this club is so that they'll have an easier time doing their assignments that their teachers give them, they can work together to get their homework done, and students can work with their teachers to raise their grades up in a specific subject.

My first reason is that students can have a easier time doing their assignments that their teachers give them. My 3 reasons that students can have a easier time doing their assignments is that the students can ask their teachers for assistance if they need it, they'll get their work done quicker, and when their teachers come to collect their work, the students will have it already completed.

My second reason is that the students can work together to get their homework done. My 3 reasons that students should work together to get their homework done is so that they can turn it into their teacher once they're done, they'll have it all completed when their teacher asks the students to give their homework up, and they'll receive a good grade from their teacher.

My third reason is that students can work with their teacher to raise their grades up in a specific subject. My 3 reasons that students should work with their teachers to raise their grade up in a specific subject is so that they can be more productive in class, they can catch up on what they've missed in class, and the teacher can guide the students on what they're confused on on their homework.

ED6070D470FF,"I despise it when someone your close to says ""you can't be like me you have to be better than that."" What right do you have to speak on what I have done, when you have done things people could not even imagine? This is why when it comes to someone you look up too or base your personality off of, make sure it is one who has credibility. Like people always say ""you are who you hang around with."" For example, being around friends who act in illegal activities your bound to do those things too. A man with honor, integrity, and takes responsibility for what he does will be respected because of his behavior.

Being a good role model is especially true when it comes to children. For example, have you ever had a little cousin or your bestfriend's baby sibling copy the same exact words that come out of your mouth? Be careful what you talk about around a kid because they repeat what you say; furthermore, it might not seem like it, but they can process everything you say. This is how in parts of the country people have various accents and pronounce words differently. When you grow up in a certain neighborhood or even in you household, while aging you will be using the different terms and phrases people around you use because that's all you ever known growing up. So staying away from words that can't be used in a school or around familly is your best bet.

A celebrity has an even greater audience when it comes to setting an example for others. People of all types of ages watch them, they are the ones who set the trends, the news revolves around, and control social media. When a celebrity messes up they get the most hate; however, if a celebrity does a great deed like a charity event then they're praised for it. They attract the most attention and most of those eyes are teenagers, who need the most advice and a figure to follow. For teenagers this is who decides for them if they'll be on the streets or in the books because famous people are who they spend most of their time with. Teenagers are always watching, whether on social media, a reality show, a sports game, or a movie, celebrities are dominating the world right now.

No mater who it is, a person always have some type of influence on somebody. That is why you should just hold that anger in next time you get in a fight because people are watching. Do some charity or show them you cleaning up the environment; in addition, just effect others in a positive way. However some would say setting example does not matter or no one pays attention to that, it is suprising how many people are effected by a person's behavior. Showing a good example with behavior does not necessarily mean change who you are, it just means be careful of the words that are exiting your mouth. No one would want their own kid to be effected by a bad role model.      ",4.5,4.0,5.0,4.5,4.5,4.0
ED8E7F6A56DD,"Opportunity to Graduate Early

Some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. The programs include some activities that can be complete during the three years, taking place in summer or after school. Student also cannot take elective classes, they need to take the necessaries to be able to graduate with all the requirements. This programs give a lot of opportunities for students. This is a good idea for student to finish high school in three and enter to college or the work force one year early because they will be able to be educate younger and earn time.

Students have a lot of labor opportunities in jobs if they are able to finish their education early and being younger. For example, to work in a company; normally the company employer wants to have young employees, but at the same time, employees with experience. If students finished early they education they can begin to work earning experience and skills. Having a positive result for their capacities and opportunities for be selected or contract to the jobs. Also young people have more physical resistance than elder people, in this way they can permanence working more time and harder. This kind of opportunities are benefits for their future employments.

Earn time it is important for every person and more important for students. For example, they can accomplish college early. If student finish high school in three years they can begin go to college one year early. In this way they can begin their preparation for the career they choose to study and finish it to be a person educate and have a stable employment. Save and earn time forming part of this programs help the students to have a better future with a good education.

There is a lot of people that are disagree about the programs that allow high school student to graduate in three years. Some points of view of this people are that student should have fun in summer instead to go to school. Also they say that student should not stay after school, they should take advantage of their time to focus on other activities or working. However, student should be allow to form part of this programs because it is give beneficial opportunities for their education. Benefits in jobs and ingress early to college.

There are some school programs that give students the change to graduate in three years and not in the normal four years. Students should use this programs because it is have a lot of beneficial possibilities to take advance. Advance to finish their education younger to have better opportunities in jobs. Advance to earn time, finish their education, and have a career early. Be part of this programs is the best idea for students that want to improve them self.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0
ED9C6EDC5601,"Adding another hour and thirty minutes to the school schedule is just a waste of time! It means having to miss time with my family. It also means having to wake up earlier to get to school. Teachers would have to stay back and work longer but probably get paid the same amount for ten hours. So I disagree with having to add another hour and thirty minutes.

First of all I don't think kids would like to wake up extra early and get ready for school. Once the students get to the school they would be half asleep and it would be harder for them to focus. The students would have trouble staying awake and they would have more attitude then what they have now. More students would be marked tardy and there would more students skipping classes just to get some sleep. Not every student would stay awake through out the day and finish there work.

Adding an hour and thirty minutes would also have an impact on teachers. They already have to wake up extra early in order to be here on time and stay late to work on grading papers, going to meetings, etc. It would be harder for them to stay awake and teach. Teachers don't even get paid enough. So why would they want to stay back and serve more time.

Some after school activities would get canceled and student that would need those after school activities would get mad. Complaints would start coming in and parents would get mad and ask why their child is failing. Some sports would be canceled and and athletes would get frustrated because they won't be motivated or asked to go to a certain collage. Students would get low grades if after school activities were to get canceled. The school would become a laughing stock.

Adding an hour and thirty minutes would have a bad effect on the school and the people in it. There would be more trouble then there is now and students wouldn't get motivated. Grade levels would go down and students won't focus. Teachers would have trouble staying up for ten hours. Family time would be shortened as well.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.5
EDD899D4131D,"Generic_Name thinks the school should control students involvement in extracurricular activities. Students are in extracurricular activities to enrich their educational experiences. Some people think schools should control student involvement in extracurricular activities because they would know if the students grades are good enough to enroll in a activity or more. Other people think students and families have the decision to pick whether students should be involved in a extracurricular activities because the school can't force you do a sport you dont want to do and they can't push away your dreams of playing a sport. Generic_Name thinks schools need to control students involvements in the extracurricular activities because not a lot of parents care if they children have time for extra assignments or they don't care if their kids stay out late to participate in any activity related to school. First of all, people think schools should decide students involvement in activities. Some students want to play many sports but not all of them will have time to complete homework assignments or study fr any quizzes and tests. For example Generic_Name's older sister use to play two sports. One was related to school and the other one was outside of school. She never had time to do her homework so her grade was going down. She also had to study for her tests but she didn't have time since she was practicing her sport too much and so she failed the grade. Secondly, other people think students and families have the decision to pick whether students should be involved in activities. An example is Generic_Name's friend wouldn't want the school to not let him play the sport he always been wanting to play. Generic_Name's friend thinks it wouldn't be fair to force him to play a sport he doesn't like. Generic_Name, Generic_Name's friend would like to play a sport to distract his mind if he is stressing or is having depression. Generic_Name also wants to have the choice to pick any sport he would like to play but also wants to finish his work in class or study his tests during lunch or before school so he doesn't fail. Lastly, the majority of people think schools need to control students involvement in activities because not a lot of parents care if their children have time for assignments or to study for tests. In general parents don't care about their kids schools or grades so they won't worry if their kids are out late for any sport. One example, Generic_Name's aunt don't care about his cousin Generic_Name so she is always out late. Generic_Name wants to try a sport in school so she can get a scholarship to go to college since her parents don't care about her but she wants to be someone in life and do better things. She wants to decide on her own if she should join a sport or not. I think the school should control the students involvement in sports. The school should control the students involvements in sports because they're can be students that want to get a scholarship by playing a sport but also want to have time to finish classwork they couldn't finish in class or study their test to not fail the class.

Swimming is an enjoyable activity because it helps me calm whenever i'm mad, I can also swim with my friends and play together, and it is also more easier and exciting to exercise whenever i'm swimming.

First of all, swimming is an enjoyable activity because it helps me calm whenever i'm mad or feeling down. Last year, when the school just finished, and all of the people left, I jumped into the pool and just swam. It made me happy because as I swam into the surface of the water, I heard the water droplets drop as I moved my feet up and down, the sound of the wave made me sleepy as they touched the wall, and the sound of the gushing water that made me feel alive as I went out of the pool. Another example would be, when I was on a field trip, we all went to the beach and stayed there for two days. As the day goes by, I was sad and upset because I didn't want to leave. What I did was I changed my clothes, took my camera, and went outside. As I walk on the sandy beach, I heard the waves as if they were ready to eat me, I heard the birds chirping as I take a picture of them. It was a very fun and calm day. That is why swimming is an enjoyable activity because it helps me calm.

Second of all, swimming is an enjoyable activity because you get to swim with your friends, even make new friends! An example would be when I was swimming alone, I was okay because I don't really mind being alone, but when my friends came, they instantly made me laugh. All of us were doing tricks and racing with each other, which is very fun. One time, when my friends was swiming underwater, they bumped each other's head and as they reach to the surface, three of us laughed. Also, learning how to swim is easier because swimming is fun, and it's more fun with your friends. An example would be your friend can help you out when you're struggling how to float. Even doing dog swim is hard for some people, which is easy for me. Also, learning by yourself isn't fun, learning with your friends is more fun. That is why swimming is an enjoyable activity because you get to swim with your friends.

Lastly, swimming is an enjoyable activity because it's mpre exciting to exercise when you're swimming. I once took a swimming lesson every friday after school. I didn't like it at first, but as soon as my third day came, I liked it so much. I gained 145 pounds for a ten year old, but when I took my swimming lesson, my weight decreased to 111 pounds. You don't really see the result, until you started having fun on what you're doing. An example would be I was really not into swimming and all I wanted to do there is to lose weight. I didn't see any improvement onj my swimming skills, and I didn't lose weight at all. Weeks passed and I started losing weight, and im becoming more better at swimming. I thought is because I got more passionate and determined when swimming that I didn't see those changes. After all what i've been through, swimming made me happy at all times. That is how swimming impacted my life.

It's more exciting and easier to exercise when swimming, you can swim with your friends and play together, and it helps me calm whenever i'm mad, and that is why swimming is an enjoyable activity. It is important for people to know this is because this is a real life story. It already helped three people when they read this. Swimming club is an enjoyable activity.",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5

EFDAD69E103B,"I have being asked to explain the effects of a program involving pairing, older students , and younger students.

Some schools have a program that pairs older students and younger students. I think that a program like that will be helpful. The older students are available to assist the younger students.

This program can be helpful, to both the older and the younger students, because both the younger and older students, can learn new things from their opponent, or classmate. Also is fair that the older students assist, the younger students, so both of them can be sucessful.

Like maybe the younger students can teach the older students, some new skills the've learned in school, or somewhere else. Or maybe how they've learned to play baseball or softball.

The older students can teach the younger students, how to do algebra / solving equations or how to ride a bike.

Helping out younger students helping order students can be fun and can also turn out to be great. Or sometimes bad.

Like for example, in my school, they have a club that both younger and older students can be in. It is free and not obligatory. So me and some of my friends, joined that club. And also some othe r students. Some of the older students, helped us, if we needed help, and we also helped them if they needed help. Every time during that club we each bring our own snacks or the teacher gives us some snacks himself, and we get to work. That club at school was so helpful for me and my friends, because we can get our homework done in time, and some older students or adults assist us if we need help. Me and my friends also enjoyed that club because it was fun at certain time.

In conclusion, pairing older students , with younger students, can be very helpful to certain people in need.

Being kind an cooperating is the best thing to do while being in a club or working with younger and older students.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5
F075F9AD2AA4,"Do you think it is a good idea for the students to commit to a career at youg age? That is a good idea because the school will give the opportunity to know more things. Also, is a bad idea because some students have a lot of things to do after school, they have responsabilities example; they have to work, they have to do things in their house, or many things what a young can do. I choose students have to take the career at a young age because:

They will be ready when they have to work in that career, if they going to take the careers that they prefer it is going to be good, because they will practice and they will learn a lot in of that ,so they will focuse everyday in that career. The most important is they won't have any problems when they have to show everything what they learn after they did finish their career.

It is a good idea because is not bad that in some societies the students has to expected to identify a career by the hight school, because about that form the people can know what is his/her specialty, or what work realized in the high school ,if that person was good or bad in that career.

Is good that person know what he/she wants to be in the future, because some people don't know what they want to be, what is their dreams when they become adult ,but some people know what they want to be ,and what is their dream job. Is very important to know that you want to be sure about your future because this opportunities are not in every where we have to exploit the things the life give us, because when I was a little girl my dad alwas plead me that I enter a couses like English, computation,to play guitar, dance, and many things ,but I always respond no ,because I just wanted to play and that set , but now I know the importance to learn ,to know ,to make something ,and show to the world that you know that you can do that ,and nonthing in this world is impossible.

They will have the capacity to learn more things about the careers what they will going to choose. Also, the school will give them the opportunity to work in the summer or after school, this idea is amazing because in others countries like my country there are not career to choose in the schools ,the student are not ready or they are not ability to work in something because they don't practice nothing in the shool they don't know anything .They just study and don't have elective courses that ways, the student in my country don't work usualy the parent are who work.

The conclution is that the students have to take some career ,bacause is very important for the societies also for them, they will be capacity to know many things. Also, they will be ready to make the work what they choose in the hight school. And the student won't have complication or doubt to may complete their job. Finaly, the students will have a profession in something that they can make very well, but this courses is not just to show to the others persons the career that you took in the high school. This career is for you ,for your future more forward. What happen if you can process with your study, this courses is an advantage in your live. You can take out a benefit to this oppportunity.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0
F0BB52DD1DB6,"I strongly agree with this statement that author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote because i can relate to it based on my passed experiences as a little kid not wanting to try new things in life like other food and activities. I did not like to try new things as a kid because when i would fail at them i would get mad or upset. But i ended up trying new things in life anyways and it helped change my mindset from not pushing myself to believing in myself that i could accomplish things and also help me grow as a person.

For example when i was l lot younger then i am today like a lot of kids i did not like to try new food. I was that type of kid that just did not like to try new thing at all. Say if i did not know what it was or had not try in before in the past i did not want it at all. Some times my mom would tell me to eat my food or she would not let me go outside or take me to the park to play. so i would eat it but not because i wanted to it was because i wanted to go play outside or go to the park because i was just full of energy all the time and always liked to be outside.

Thinking back to those memories at least the ones that i can remember i always seem to get easily upset. When i did not know how to do something that other kids or people knew and could do. I would throw a fit you could say sometimes and not want to be a part of the activity at all and just straight up get mad over simplest things that just needed some time put towards them. So i could learn them or master them or someone that could have taught them to me. I think if i wouldnt have gave up on some things when i was younger i would have know how to do a lot more then i can today. Instead of just watching the other people do this type of activities and enjoy themselves. I always wanted to know how to play these sports as a kid. Like know how to play soccer,football,and play basketball. Instead i would give up on myself on the first time i failed at it.

But as time went by and the older i got little by little i started to try new things in life besides just other foods. I think the reason for this was that my mindset was changing and i did not give up on myself anymore i started to push myself to achieve my goals. I learn that anger would help me too like this one time in middle school i was in my math class my teacher said that i could not solve the problem that he had put on the board because i did not pay attention in class. So i got mad and did my best to solve him and show him that i could solve that problem and i did after class he came up to me and told me that he was proud and that he knew i could do it cause when someone tells me i can not i get mad and work hard to prove them wrong. He also told me to never let what other people say stop me from achieving my goals in life and to also try to control my anger. I understand that know because i know there people who look out for you and help you. But also there are lots of people that do not want to see you make it in life and do better then them.

This is why i strongly agree with this author by the name Ralph Waldo Emerson and his statement. That go by the lines of unless you try to do something that you have never done before you will never grow. Its just how some people play it safe in life and do not attempt to do or try scary things in there life like rock climbing,sky diving swimming with sharks sneaking into abandon house cause its haunted by a ghost or something not like other people who live their lives with no fear. You can be scared i life but do not let them fears keep you from having fun and enjoying life.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0

But I think that is not necessary to seek guidance from experts. The first reason that I think that is not necessary to seek guidance from experts it is that you can learn new things in your life doesn't matter if you make a mistake. The second reason that I think that the people should make their own decisions it is that a expert does know every thing about your life does know your feelings.

As you can see my first reason that I think that it is not necessary to seek guidance from experts it is because people can learn new things in their life you can make a different in your life. Doesn't matter if you make mistakes you not are a perfect person. Every person learn about their mistake. Do what ever you want. The people does know what is better for you every people thinks different to what you think.

The second reason that I think that the people should make their own decisions it is because a expert does know every thing about your life. You can make your own decision. A expert can't choose what is better for and what it is not. Also experts can be incorrectly to what is tell you to do.

In conclusion, I think is more better to do your own things and do what you think is more better for you don't let people do the things for you. So, I believe that the people should make their own decisions. The reasons that I think that you should do your own decisions are 2.

F167D1995565,"It Has Been Said That First Impressions Are Almost Impossible To Change.

Do You Agree Or Disagree With That Statement?

People don't know everything by born. They have to learn everything by culture and family. Every culture has different impression but we have to caught it because we are human. Everybody has a lot of impression. Many people would have different opinion about this statement. In my opnion, I am disagree with that first impression are not impossible to change because all people are live in culture, practice can change anything, and they are adjustable.

First reason, I believe that first impression are not impossible to change because all people are live in culture and culture change impression. One person has more than one impression and different culture has different impression. People make comfortable with new impression. For example, I born in bangladesh but I live in USA. I have a different impression than before becuse now I am live in new culture, they have new impression. Almost I forget my old impression because USA culture change my impression. People help us to change our imression because whatever we see around us we can hold it.

Another reason, I am not agree with that first impression are impossibe to change because practice can change anything. People don't want to do whatever they don't like. But if you do everyday whatever you don't like oneday you will like it because practice can make anything perfect . For example,

my friend who came from bangladesh without family even she disn't know anything about this place. But she have to do everthing her ownself. Everyday she is practice new culture that's make her to learn new impression. Now she doesn't remember her old impression becuse if you practice everyday new things. You will forget old impression becasue she doesn''t preactice her old impression.

Finally, I disagree with that first impression are almost impossible to change because people are adjustable. In the world, people are the only things who can adjust themself to any other new things. When we went to the new place we have to do lot of new things. Even we have to change our impreassion because every place has different kind of impression. And people can adjust themself with new impression. For example, people impression are like water. Doesn't matter where you put water it will be shape like where you put water because water is liquid and people mind is changeable. When we go to the new place we have to have change our impresson and it does't matter who you are and where you are.

In conclusion, people have to say that first impression are not impossible to change because people live in culture, practice can change anything, and people are adjustable with new things. Most of people wouldn't agree with that statement. We don't have to believe that whatever other people said. People has a right to say whatever they believe. Human beings are adjustable with impression becasue we are changeable. Whatever we can imagine we can do it. Everything is possible for human. Even I believe that first impression are not hard to change but we have to be faithful about our opnion.",2.5,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,3.5

Therefore, I would like to go out to Disney land to view the huge castles with decoration ,and visible lights that would just glow my night up!.

Imagine yourself playing your favorite sport or your favorite hobby. In this example i'll be using hockey. Lets say you just love being offense since your really good at it, and always help your team to win with your blossom hits. Therefore since you would love hockey (defense) ,and I love watching plays both would connect to form a connection which would be a joy of winning in hockey ,and a joy of watching people preform plays.

F1A4167422E2,"I disagree with the fact that the school board wants to add an extra hour and a half to each school day. I disagree because many students might have something to do when they come out of school,they are also going to have to get used to a whole new schedule,and they might not have enough time to study or do their homework at home.

After school many students might have something to do or attend. For example,students might have to attend a club, take care of one of their younger siblings, or maybe they have a job after school. If the school board adds another hour and half to a school day these students might have to miss the activity that they have or might have to change what they do. This is bad but what is even worse if having to get used to a whole new school day routine.

They will need to get used to a different schedule or routine. Students will have to get used to much more longer classes and having to leave at a later time. Like I mention in my other paragraph sometimes students have things to do out of school,so they might have to change everything so that they will be able to attend or do what they need to do after school,For example,if they have a job they might have to change their job schedule so that they won't be late. This leads me to my other reason about not having time to do their work at home.

Students might not have to time to study or do their homework at home. Think about it. By the time that students get home,eat,relax,and do anything else they do when they get home,they might end up starting their homework at a really late time. What if they have to study for a test,by the time they start studying they might only have an hour to do it. I know some people might say to their school work before anything else,but what if the student is not able to do their work right away.

In conclusion The school board shouldn't add an extra hour and a half to each school. Although, many people might think that it is a good idea to have extended school hours. It would save a lot of time and work to just leave the school hours like they already are. And,their wouldn't be a reason to add an hour and half because students get a most of their work done in the amount of time they give them in the school day.     ",4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5

strongly believe student do benefit from working in a group. Working in a group has it's advantages, and I feel it's a better choice. When work work in a group you can see different ideas,learn to work with other and also you can met new people.

When you work with other people you can see the different ideas also you can learn know things. You can see the same problem in different ways but as a group you try to find the best way to solve them. For example let's say you have to do a project for a class, and you have to do it in a group. As a group you can share you Knowledge of what you know about the topic and share them with you group . Also you can share you ideas with your group,and see if they like it or maybe they can add something more to your idea to make it a better one . You can see who you have in common with them also you can see the differences you have with you group members .

Working as a group can really have a good advantages. If it is a really big project you dint have to do it alone. Also you can split work and everyone can get a small portion of the project. You can also see people creativity. In a group every one is good in something, so lets say if there is some who is really good at drawing and some one really good in writing then the project can look really nice and the penmanship will look great. You can get it done half as fast with every one in the group does what they have to do and work as a team .

When you work in a group you can met new people. Maybe you change schools. You do not know any one at your new school. When you work in a group, you can meet new people and make friends. It also work if you are shy because in a group you have to communicate with others to get the work done, or you are just a born leader you can help other how to start the project together or tell people how to do thing because they do not know what to do first. Also it works so you can get out your confer zone and try new things. For example you really like to draw but you do not know how to draw really good maybe some one from your group knows how and they can teach you .

As a conclusion I think student do benefit when they are in group. Because not only they can share there different ideas. You learn how to work as a team. You can met new people, and make new friends.        ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5
F22FE8D7FA16,"Students should commit to a career at a young age?. Many people thing that this would be an advantage in the future, because if many students choose a career when they are young, then there's going to be more professionals that can help the country, but other people thing the opposite, because they thing that the students are not ready to choose a career,because they are not in the age to thing by themselves. In my opinion, I would say that both arguments have good reasons to support their arguments, but l would prefer to be disagree with this opposition.

For my first reason, I would say that it's too much responsibility for their age, because they don't have the experience necessary to complete a career that they like, but they are not prepare to complete, however if they choose a career, then they have to worried about the college that they want and how much it's going to cost to them and their family to start a career, also because they are not going to take the career seriously, and it's going to be a waste of time in a career that they can not hold by themselves, so they are going to leave the career.

In addition, my second reason is that they don't have the ability to maintain a career mentally, because they can not control their actions and thinking, and if they do things wrong ,and they try to solve their problems alone, it's going to be stressful for them, what can cause a distinct kind of future that they don't expect , so they can get affect by all the things that can occur on your way, and also because there's going to be people that instead of help you, it's going to use for their benefits, and one example of that is the people who works in factories, construction, and bussines.

Finally, my last reason talks about how much time they have to enjoy their life, if they have to work in their career at a young age, because you can choose to be a professional when you are young and find jobs with that kid of career, but if you already know that you are going to work almost the rest of your life to have better future and keep progressing, so why don't enjoy your youth and be happy doing things that you like, instead of worry about find a career that if you are not ready, it's going to make you problems that you don't want to have now.

In conclusion, supporting with the reasons, I would like to say that the best thing to progress in life, is to find something that your are good, that you can control, and also something that you can make money with that,

however if know what you want to do in the future, and you know how you are going to try to make it possible, why don't enjoy what you have now, and leave the occupations for later, so you can concentrate in what you want now, before it's start to being late,because life is only one and we have to enjoy the maximum as we can.

They will take responsibility for your actions and their consequences. In order to gain self-respect and confidence people needs to have a positive attitude. 3/5 people in the world has a positive attitude. It has been proved that people who has a positive attitude has the highest acceptance rate in a community, then the people who do not have a positive attitude. However its true that people who has a positive attitude are more happy and it has an important impact on the society due to their daily life activities. They will show empathy, compassion,and care towards the needs and feelings of others. People who has a positive attitude will always think creatively and find different ways to solve their problem. it consider many perspectives and how their solution will impact others in so many different ways.

As we all know people who has a positive attitudes are more respectful people among the people in a community. They still need more attention and encouragement for their good deeds and being a rule model for kids. People who has a positive attitude will impact the society in good terms. for example most of the people who has a positive attitude are more knowledgeable, They will help others in their problems, they will seek ideas, information, and share their personal experiences just to help others in their hard times and show them the right way.

In order to gain some experiences and life lessons. People needs to spend more time with people who has positive attitudes. People with positive attitudes are so caring, balanced, and have a lot of experiences from life. which it includes as a good experiences and bad experiences. However these experiences are so helpful for the people who want to change their bad attitude to positive attitude. If they want to change for the better version of themselves, They have to talk to someone who has a positive attitude and stuck to the process and let go of off their bad habits. Therefore we need more people who has positive attitude and at the same amount of time they can help others to change for the better version of themselves. People with positive attitude are symbols to kids and for the upcoming generation. Moreover people with the positive attitude are all this world needs and we have to give them their credits and salute to them.

lastly, people with positive attitude have self-confident, and reflective views. society will introduce them as a rule model, their good deeds and positive attitudes will encourage kids to call them, their real life heroes. People with positive attitude are so down to earth and so kind hearten people. We have to give them the respect that they deserved and knows their value, that how important they are and they can be. People with positive attitude will commit everything, just to bring a good change in your life, and to see you do good and be a successful person in your life. People with positive attitude are people who will not let you down, they will not break their promises, and they will not lose your trust. For example: sometimes people will lose themselves in world with so many people, at the same they can find themselves with the right person who can guide them to the right path in a lost world. To help them get through their hard times and hold their hand and guide them to the right path, where they can work on themselves and build up what they have lost in the past. They can take the second chance and move forward to a successful life.

To be continued, People needs to have a positive attitude in order to graduate from High School, College, and Universities. A lot of people are smart, they have money, but they are lacking on having a positive attitude. It cause them a lot of family problems, problems in public, and in school. However its not good for their life. Generally, they needs to bring changes in their attitude if they want to do good in life and be a successful person.

To conclude, it is one of the most valuable factors, that everyone needs to know about it and share it with others. Positive attitude is the key to successful,self respect, and self-confident. people who has positive attitude are the most honest, trustworthy and they are so down to earth people. Positive attitude can help people to rebuild their identities and to stay focus on daily activities.                                                          ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5

F28D4ACF03AA,"I have multiple talents and skills, but my favorite one is skateboarding. Skateboarding is a very difficult skill it takes several hours, days maybe even years to accomplish and learn a trick on a skateboard, but that's why it's such a unique sport and skill. Skateboarding has become a daily activity for me, it takes all my stress and problems away, that's why I enjoy it so much. I skate everywhere to the store, a friends house, and maybe even to school. although I get lots of injuries like scrapes, bruises and many more I still love this sport because skateboarding has taught me a lot like, being able to be confident when i try new things, getting right back up when I fall, and being able to learn from my mistakes. Skateboarding isn't just a sport, skill, activity or hobby it's a way of life and even tho it may not be the safest sport ever it's still one of my favorite skills that I think I wont get bored of any time soon. When I was nine I had lots of friends that would skateboard and I didn't know anything about skateboarding at the time so it was really cool being able to observe such a unique sport. I would always see them practicing and skating everywhere and that encouraged me one day to try it. So a couple days later I went up to my parents and told them that I wanted to try something new and it was skateboarding, my mom said she would think about it because she didn't want me to hurt my self, but my dad on the other hand told me to just go for it and that's exactly what I did. The next day after school I asked my mom if we could go to the nearest skate shop and she said yes. Once we got to the the skate shop I was looking around and i was so confused I saw decks wheels and so much more that i didnt even know about. So as I walked in the guy that was working there asked me ""is there something specific you are looking for"". I told him I was new to skateboarding and that i've never been on top of one, so he taught me what i needed to know about a skateboard like about the deck, grip tape, trucks, wheels, and hardware. After that we got into assembling my first ever skateboard. Once I was done picking out all the stuff that was going to be on my skateboard we payed and he stared assembling it, once he finished we left the skate shop and it was to dark so I didn't get to skate that day sadly. The next day I get back home from school I put down my backpack and I imedietly went outside to try my new skateboard out the only thing i knew was to ride but i imedietly fell in love with skating. Since that day i've been skating every day and if it's not every day it's every other day. ",2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,2.5
F2AE464DA15E,"Do you think a good way to success in life you had to fail first?.

In this paper i will argue about, why people should believe fain in life it is so important because if you fail a least in one thing in life it's help you be more confident and be prepared for the real world and also help you that if you want something you had to fight for the.

My mom always tell me "" Be confident i believe in you"". When i was in 1 grade in my country Honduras one teacher tell my mom that i'm not in math the i'm going to fail the grade and i did it. But my mom tell me that and she also tell me if you fail the grade it's no becasue you are not intelligent. It's because it is difficult for you but i know you can do it and i did it the next year i have to take again 1 grade but that year was diffrent and the teacher tell's my mom that it was amazing how good i was in math and the other class too. I'm happy that i fail 1 grade because shows me if you fail one time doesn't mean you had to give up , you had to figth back like i did.

I always said to me you had to fight back never give up in my dreams no matter how difficult is. When i was a kid my dream was the i want to be a lawyer. One time in my school we have to said what we want to be when we grow up and i said i want to be a lawyer. One student tell me how could you be a lawyer you never going to complete that career and said to him you never know no matter how many times i fail. I know i'm going to be a lawyer because if you not fight back for your dreams. That's mean your i said you are failure person and i'm not a failure person. Not allowed other people said you never going to make never.

If you fail one time or more doesn't mean you never going to make is the contrary. In my whole life that it is 18 years old i fail many time but i always i had in mind. I fail i learn a new lesson today beacuse all the fail times i had in my life i take as a lesson to help to prepare for the real world and how it is.

Someone may think i wrong to think like that but they are the wrong ones beacuse no ones is perfect in life everyone make a mistake or fail in something in life

To be a successful person in life you have to take step by step and also no matter how many time you fail keep going. You are gonna make don't allowed other person said what exactly you had to do.

In the future i hope people never give up in their dreams just because they fail one time or more and also show the person's who tell you ""You never gonna make it"". Shows them that you did it all by yourself.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5
F38E063ED945,"Being yourself doesn't depends in how people see you, it depends on you because you are the only one that can choose to change or not, it makes no difference if you did something right or wrong the society always will discriminate and see that at the way they think it is,and you can't do anything about it, you are doing the things that you feel that are correct and how is the way how is has to be, however being in a world that is trying to make you something else is a great accomplishment because there is not way people make you change;

you had to live your life at the way you want it, you have the opportunity to express your feelings everywhere, and you are in the world to be happy and not to satisfy every single person

Sometimes it's hard for you to be deal in the society with opinions that hurt you and make you feel bad about it, and that is something that you cannot change, but it is something that help you to learn how to be more responsible when you are growing up and to be overconfident about what are your thoughts, you have to know that in the world are many people want to see you go down and change the way you are, in that situation you have to be with your head up and be who you really want to be, you can do the difference in your life, but not in others person life

In addition, you have to be proud and brave everywhere you go to because you have the opportunity to express what are yours feelings, there is not way that somebody can change what is in you heart, only you choose who can hurt you and if you want that continue, try to stay positive all the time not matter what is going on in your life, do not let someone know what are your debilities and how you feel about things go in on in your life that person can hurt you every time he/she want it, do the things that make you feel better with yourself

Finally, be happy all the time with the things that you have because it might be the little things, but are things for which you work really hard to have it, you have to be brave especially when you have done something that probably other person will see that bad, however that doesn't mean you are wrong is just what they think about it, you need to be how you feel comfortable and not to maintain happy the society, reach your goals how you want it, don't let anyone destroy your dreams because if that happen you are not going to be cheerful about it

In conclusion, live your life how you want it because is only one, do what you think is correct and follow your dreams, since the moment you let the time past by doing what other people want; you will not be happy nor proud about what you really want to achieve, it's difficult to trust people that one day made you feel safe and in peace and then did things that they knew that it hurt you; if you really want something good for somebody else you will do everything to protect that person and make it feel unique, simply be yourself without get involved in other person's life.

F3A5981B0288,"Is a good idea that the students identify a career by the time they enter high school, and think about the future.

The importance of decide what career the students want to take before they leave of the high school,

is to prevent to be confused when they enter to the University . For example , if the students take mechanic courses or courses about how to be a Doctor in High School , would help them to experiment what career they would like to take after High School .

If the students decide experiment to be a nurse or doctor , they will go to a Central Medic or Hospital and get information about that career , or they will go to a mechanic workshop to learn and get knowledge about how to be a mechanic .

Is a good idea for students think about a career to young age or try to be prepare for the future and take some courses of study in high school because if the teenagers try to found some career that can be agreeable for them and try to learn about it , it is a good form that they can be prepare in the future .

With the opportunity of learn in different courses in high school , will be more easy for the students to decide what specific career they like more and they want to learn and study after high school

In other hand , the specific courses in high school , would be selected by the students , because if they decide to take a course that they like , they will enjoy at the same time , and they will try to do the better they can

F3ACD9A99ADA,"Success is about to enforced our self and to accomplish our goals, as I know nobody was born knowing something everyone was born to learn and to fail every time that is possible to learn more However I agree with Churchill's statement that is about the important role that failure plays in the success, My reasons are that we can protrude, influenced others, more personal experience.

My first reason is that everyone can protrude and be proud over our self ,and protrude means to take the best of us and show it, for example, in my case lass year I loss my job because I didn't have enough age to work in the company this year I start my own company and I have my own employees, this is a example how failure didn't take my enthusiasm, and that we can loss twice maybe but not forever because be will be success later.

My second reason is that our attitude is everything we can infused others that have been losing their life and their enthusiasm and show them that everyone can enforced and get what they want,

A example will be my cousin she had been in 12 grade for 3 years that at the first year that she didn't pass her grade herself confidence went down and she had loss her goals, but this year she will graduate because this year she is been preparing to pass her classes and to get her diploma, this is a example of been failing, and failing and then get the success.

Other might say that success and failing isn't good for our society, however I sill disagree because to get success or to win we have to learn from the beginning, my third reason is that with the experience what we have of been losing and failure twice and twice we will know that we are going to do and be successful later. According to a quote that say ''You can loss a battle but not the war'', In fact we can loss everything but not our enthusiasm.

In conclusion, this is why I agree with Churchill's statement that is about the important role that failure plays in the success, My reasons are that we can protrude, influenced others, more personal experience. everyone is exert to failure but what we have to do is to continue and don't surrender don't give up with our goals, always been happy doesn't paying attention to the situation.

People hurts someone feelings because they made something really bad even if a person tells them that they are doing wrong things, they keep doing it, because for them the decisions that they are making are great for them. One example, lets say, when we were young that we fall a lot time in love. we were wishing to have someone to advise us because we think if the decision that we are going to make is not going to hurt someone. We always think about what is going to happen if we do things that we know are not good choices. We need somebody to advise us about anything. Another example, when I was planing to leave my house with my boyfriend because I did not wanted to go to school. I get really mad. I did not think on anything. I just wanted to do it even if Mom gets a heart attack because she wants me be more educate and have a better future, so someone that I have not seen in my whole life get close to me and say "" You are too young, think about what life can brings you if you go to school, if you graduate from college that many wonderful thing you can have. Do not throw your life in that way. You will have time to be with someone"" I realized that I was making the worse decision ever.

Everyone always need someone to be agree about their decisions, because someone may have a lot of experience about life that way they can be the guide for them. they can talk about the decisions that they were making in the past and that can helps to make a good decisions. One example, one friend made a bad a really bad decision. His family told him to stop doing the things he was doing because it will be a lot consequences. That is what happened he made a wrong decision. He did not listen and now is dead because of his decisions.

Most think that they are old enough to take their own decisions, as we can see, it does not matter what age we have. What matters is how mature we are, because we have to be aware of the responsibility about any kind of decisions we are going to make. We have to say to ourselves "" okay if I do this I have to be conform about the result that I am going to get"".

Clearly, All we do is because someone is making us better by telling that we do not always have to trust on ourselves. Sometimes for some discussion we do not do the right thing, we do not think and we use our bad mood and due to that we make bad choices. We have to be more responsible.

Think before your decisions. ",3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,3.0

I personally want my dream to go to college accomplished by the future, get a career, high education, be the first one in my family that has gone to college.

First of all going to college can help me get the career I want which is game designing. game designing is a career I have wanted to get since I turned twelve years old when I first started playing minecraft. Minecfrat is an awesome game where you can build really cool things that come out of your mind, yo may create a whole new entire world in there. When I turned twelve I always wonder how did they make games go so real so I started reading articles, books, etc. then I stared playing more games and it was incredible. I want to go to college and be able to make my own games because I know people would love playing them. I want to make my own gaming company and kids going around talking about my games. but the only way I can actually do that is by having a college career.

My second reason why I want to go to college is because the majority of people in the United States just drop out of high school. People who dropped out of high school have a really low education degree. I personally want people to think I am smart just by looking at my education record. If u completed your goal in college, if you graduate, people would offer really good jobs to you with a high salary only because your education is high and you know what your doing because they've taught you that in college.

Last but not least I want to be the first one in my family that has actually gone, completed, and graduate out of college. My family is not poor nor is rich we are in the middle class, which I understand why some of my family could not actually afford to go to college. but some people in my family had has the opportunity and they just din't wanted to go because they wanted to live the life, was they're excuse but living the life is not working at a pizza place or McDonald's. I want to demonstrate to all my family, who actually had the opportunity of going to college and din't, that the way they think living the life is wrong. I want them to see that even going to college you can still live the life and probably even better when you have actually graduate. I want for my two little brothers to see, to be proud of their sister and be a good role model for them, so they can follow my steps and get a good live.

We all have our goals that we would like to accomplished in the future. maybe when you grow up you are just going to change plans and do something more important.

Also Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend class from home by way online or video conferencing. I think is good idea, students would benefits from being able to attend class from home.

Some students take class in home because they do not have time to go to the school. For example, this e students need to take class from online because they work at night or at day . Clearly, they do not have time to go the school because they time is short and they need to organize their day for take a class so, some students take a class from online because their have many reason . In summary, some students need time for study , and they need this position from online for study and they can finish their class.

To day in the world exist many disease, and we need to get precautions with this dangerous disease. So for this problem some students can't go to the school for this big problem. Relating, this problem with school because the students health is so important. For example, the corona virus is so dangerous, students need a protection, because this illness inflict many death. Is so easy to get sick. For this reason, 
is important to students to get class from online or video conferencing,

is better study at home and also a good place, is the best way for students not get sick from this dangerous disease. However, this disease not have medication, but students we cant to prevent get to sick also, studying at home. In summary, is important to caring students they are the future for the world. For this reason some school need to get dis option, learning from online or video conferencing.

In another hand , i think is good idea, students would benefits from being able to attend class from home, and other people belief, this not a good idea , students would benefits from being able to attend class from home for this issue, students not leaning in one video conference but, some students don't want to go to the school because they have more than 17 years old or they can't enter to school for their age. Because, for you can enter to school minimal you need to have 15 to 17. Also, you have 18 you can't not to enter at school and is a problem because you can't find a good work if you dont have a graduation certificate from school. For example, some students want to study , but they can't because they can't enter to school for their age, I think is so important to exist a program when the people older the age can study line or video conferencing. However, many people need to get a certification but they can't for this problem, also the best solution is studying online is more accessible for them. They can have more opportunities in their life , they can get a better job. For instance students can learning online , is a big benefit for this students was can't enter at school. In definition everybody need a opportunity for study, for get a certificate from school. obviously the students are responsible with their class at home.

The benefit was school online or video conference represent is the student get more concentration at home , they do not have distraction for any other students, they do not suffer by bulling and they can get a good grade studying a lone in home. For example, sometime students get bad grade for this reason , distraction , they can't sleep at night also, they need to wake up to early for this reason they sleep in class,and they not put attention because they are tired. Also, the students have the opportunity to studying online they can organize their time and pass their class easy because they are focus with their class online also they not have distraction and its for that reason they get a good grades, students need class online or video conferencing , this program help many studying or many young girl are pregnant. Some young girl want to finish her high school but she can't because her are pregnant. However, some school get a program studying online is to much better for this students are pregnant is more easy, to studying at home because she can eating when she hungry and carrying her health for her baby. The program studying online is important to exist help to many students with different problems situations or health problems. In summary learning as action for students who wants to study online or video conferencing. I think is a good program for many students who want to study. Clearly,

everybody has the opportunity to study obviously the students who get study online has a responsible to attend every day their class and get their certification high school.

In conclusion, class online or video conferencing have many option to study, just is question of time for the students , they need to organize time for study online and can graduate , this program no have many different then the school just, the student need to stay alone and the benefit of that is you can concentrate better alone by your self. Also is better studying at home for this many disease dangerous is more comfortable state at home. However students no need age for study, what they need is inspiration and intelligent for study not need age.

Technalogy doesn't create limition of connection between people, because it help people to create new connection over best cumunicting sites, fastest way of connection between humans that are far located from each other, also less cost of contact between people.

Technalogy was the solution for the less connection between human that been misconstrue by minorityof people those are who never used the way should be used. secientestes people who find out after alots of research that technalogy is the best way to persuad people connect with each other. Technalogy created for one purpose to make easy life for humans, and create a great cumuniction way through the world that connected with each other.

Technalogy planned, designed to make the fastest way between human's by not taking longer time it make so easy people doesn't needed any more to go to our relatives place to cumnicate with them know it totally changed by cellphone the new technalogy.

Also now days technalogy is the most biggest part of humans life our life almost run with technalogy in every part. but still some people think's that it's not helpful to have the advance system of technalogy.

Minority of people misconstrue about technalogy because they never used the advance technalogy or they might be used it but they never realize because at some points there are some how people should be aware of how to should use it, and it all need knowledge that some people doesn't have that so it's really hard for them to use it.

Technalogy might be useful to comunicate with people but sometimes it's hard for those group of people that doesn't have the knowledge how to use it, get benfite from it. So everything comes back to the circle that people connected with it but this circle also need to have knowledge of writing, reading, lessning that all include a great system of eduction.

F530741D2297,"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing."" Jefferson's quote is accurate because we can not accomplish something without doing something in life. Everyone has a goal in life; to meet those goals we have to prepare and take steps to complete them. Some people may say that inactivity can also serve a purpose because there are people, including: famous people, family members, or teachers who has once been passionate about something they have done in their lives who quit and became someone bigger, but they are wrong. There is a lot that can be done and steps to take if we are always doing something for ourselves or for others because instead of doing nothing we can focus on our education to help us in the future or to make this world a better and wonderful place for everyone.

For starters, when students focus on their education all the time there is a lot that can be done. One reason why students can do so much with our education is because often education can prepare us for a big exams. For example, in class students are learning and reviewing different tropics repeatedly, which will help us pass any exams that will be given to us. This proves that when students are constantly learning something they can accomplish anything that they were leaning or reviewing throughout the year. This shows students how much they have done by focusing, instead of doing nothing. Another reason why students can do so much with their education is because it can help them graduate and accomplish bigger things in life. For example, most students that are always on task and doing everything that they should be doing have bigger plans in life than those who do not. This proves that students that accomplish more by being on task with their education will graduate with a future ahead of them. As a result, students that are focus and on task are more likely to feel incredible for everything they have accomplished in their education.

Second, a lot of people around the world can do so much to help other communities by volunteering and to make this world a better place. A reason why it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing something is because we can help those around us. For instances, there is a lot of people around the world that need our help, such as homeless people or families who live poor. We as a community can feed those who are homeless or can help families who need help with jobs or to get health insurance. This shows, that if we gather together as a group we can see how much we have done to help these people in need. Another reason to see how much we can do together is by making great choices in life. For example, we can plant fruits and vegetables and give them out for free to help people around us to consider to make better food choices. As a result, there is many opportunities we can take to make this world become a better place for everyone. We can only accomplish a lot by doing everything in our power to make better this world a better place.

In Jefferson's quote, he was saying that we can do so much by doing something and it is true. If we put our mind into something and do everything we can to accomplish what we have in mind we can do anything, but if we just sit there doing nothing, we will not have the outcome we expected to want. Everyone lives in different ways, but it is important to see what each of us individuals can accomplish in life. The only way we can graduate is by focusing and staying on task. Some may see the see the world as being lazy, but we can change that by helping out and planning something together as a group to make a change in the world. It is important that we are making a change for ourselves and our communities. These are some reason why we should always do something to get the outcome that we want to see.",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5
F53B14C7F455,"One topic that people debate a lot is that students expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. they courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. I think is not a good idea for a student to commit to a career at a young age. because students are not old enough they careless and not make the best decision when they at a young age.

One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because, students are not old enough to know what they career in specific. they not prepared for the world students in high school don't have any experience of any career.

I think is a little to early. I will explore all type of career when my senior junior year starts I would make sure to select the right courses and the better one to be prepared or have experience for your career.

One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because sometimes teenagers are careless something may go wrong with your life or you just wanna do something new. all those classes that I selected from freshman year are not gonna be worth it because you gonna have to take new classes. for example my friend selected a technology class in freshman year, and he search it up how much they make in a year and that was not what he expected. so he change to materials and process to learn how to cut, and built houses.

One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because, when you are in a young are you make the wrong decision well sometimes but I think the best decision for me during high school is to to wait and study the better classes and the best and better career. and to be able to do that you have to care about classes and be responsible with school and career.

As you read you can see the reasons,I think the best idea for students is to focus in high school and get good grades when you get to senior year or college, you know more about life and careers I think that would be the best time to selected the best classes that are gonna guide you toward a specific career.",2.5,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5

I try to do my best to Accomplish everything, i can as fast i can to catch up.

Always have a mindset goal, realistic goals, and measurable.

F5EFA67354E6,"Yes, I do agree with Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's statement, because people do fail over and over again without loosing enthusiasm.

I have good enthusiasm. For example I failed a lot of classes in high school and I had to repeat them I gave all of my best effort on every class I had to take even if I wasn't good at it or if I didn't like it because I don't want to keep repeating them just because I didn't try i have great confidence on every skill I have and i always try to improve them in a better way I ask for help to see what i need improve on and I eventually did get better and it was worth it because it made things much easier i understood all of the problems I had trouble with I brought my grades up on the class I was failing on i mostly got B's on the tests and quizzes it's way better than getting a D I was glad that I was making changes and improvement on my skills it was the best thing I have ever done.

I have dont ever give up, for example one time i remember i had to do make a little video game for my school project and as i was making it i didn't know what kind of video game to make i didn't have any ideas of what to make and i thought of giving up because i didn't know what to make and then i started thinking of making a first person shooting game and it was mostly like the game Call of Duty but i made a little change to it i put in the choices to choose any gun from the previous games it can be a gun from any Call of Duty game i feel like that was a good idea because some people would really like to have some of the old weapons back and they like a game that is boots on the ground and i also made a zombie game mode i put in some better things in that mode and i kept adding more details to the game and i am actually glad that i didn't give up because it tells me that I am not a quitter and that i wont be giving up so easily.

some people would disagree with Winston Churchill statement because they dont believe that failure would consist to success they think that if you fail your gonna fail again over and over no matter how hard you try your always gonna fail i know some people say that because i had a friend that literally gave up so fast it was pretty sad and i kept telling him that you have to keep trying there's no other choice you can do but push yourself and he didn't he just gave up and didn't even bother to try. However not everyone gives up so fast because they believe in themselves they don't loose their confidence even when they are not at their best they still wont give up because they know they can do better the next time they do it you just got to keep trying till you make it.

F610C7BCD9EC,"Technology seems to be becoming more and more important now. As the technology improves year by year, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But people have very different thoughts to this idea, then the problem comes. Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Although some think students should attend classes from home, actually they shouldn't attend classes from home because students might be doing other things during the online class time. And students would get less opportunities to communicate with their friends if they attend classes from home.

Those who believe students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home have their reasons. They think it's much safer for students to take an online class at home. And they also believe it might be better for students to study under a quite environment.

One reason of why students shouldn't attend classes from home is that they might be doing other things during the online class time. An example of this would be my cousin, Generic_Name. He took an online class on the computer few months ago. In the beginning, he was so exciting because it was the first time for him to take a class at home. And his parents were happy to see that because it's difficult to send Generic_Name to school everyday, both of them had work to do. After a few weeks, Generic_Name got his first test grade of online study. It was much lower than the grade he used to get. I asked the reason later, he explained he was playing his cell phone during the class time and didn't pay attention. If he normally took classes in the school, I thought he would get at least a ""B"" in this test. He was smart,just too lazy to study. It's undeniable that online classes brought a lot of convinces to Generic_Name and his family, but it was not the best way to help him to improve his grade.

Another reason of why students shouldn't attend classes from home is that students would get less opportunities to communicate with their friends. An example of this would be my friend, Generic_Name. Although he wasn't like to talk, he had a lot of friends in the school because he was nice to everyone. But everything has changed, since he attended classes from home . We didn't see him for a long time even the class was over. His parents told us he won't come to school anymore because he hated school. If Generic_Name took classes at school like before, he would meet more friends. I can't say if it's a bad choice to attend classes from home, but at least not the way for those students who wasn't like to talk.

In conclusion, although some think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, I believe students shouldn't attend classes from home. They should get more opportunities to communicate with their friends, and enjoy their short, but wonderful school life. ",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0

The first reason is when someone show their kindness to much and they get annoyed.

My last reasons] is also a ex:Then you spare/give him respect Generic_Name is happy and goes home you can chose to kill the king or go to his house and live with him and ask him to teach you the acts of kindness.

Some other ways people and kids can help they can show kindness to the ocean bye getting trash in the water.

Another why people can show kindness is helping the community pick up trash on the ground.

People across the world their are so much kind people out their they can help you with anything.

Like clean up your yard and the shed and the playground and the trampling and the outside of the house.

And they need kindness to so we help them to in needed or in trouble.

I had a old friend name umm... i forget so lets call her Generic_Name she had a lot of problems like trying to kill her self or cut her self or Evan hang her self but i was all ways there for her but on day she went missing and i never saw her again we had good times together but she was there for me to like when we were kids she wood protect me from bullies and demons i don't know how she known about demons when we were in 3 grade i did not care. Sometimes i wounder is she here watching me has a ghost i would be happy but creep out at the same time. And thats why kindness is impotent in life.     ",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,3.0
F78366DD5A31,"The decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their family because, students know how to mange their time, families would remind or help out, and teachers give students time to finish or study assignments.

As a senior in high school, I attend to many activities after school and still have plenty of time to complete assignments. I believe, that managing time is key on getting everything done on time. In the past, I have asked teachers on how I could mange my time and still have time to complete assignments. After having that conversation, I had improved my grades and also had time for activities. Thats why I think managing time is a good way to complete school work and finish any outside activities.

If my family were to see me go out a lot or come back late from any activity without completing my work, they would talk to me and find a way to help me out. After that, they would see my grades and check for any late assignments because, there is no family that would like for their son/daughter to have bad grades in school. Many students would not pay attention on their grades and go outside thinking that they have nothing due for any classes. Although, thats when families come in and remind their child that they have assignments to complete before they go outside. This is why families are good reminders and helpers on getting good grades.

Teachers in high school give students enough time to complete assignments or study during class. I tend to complete it during class because I like to go home and not worry about any school work. Overtime if a student does not finish their homework, teachers tend to say that they gave us time to complete it during class. However, I do not make that same mistake and finish my work during class, so that the teacher would not bother me. That is why taking advantage on finishing working during class, is a good why to have time for any outside activity.

That is why schools should not control any student, and regarding extracurricular involment shall be left to students and their families.    ",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5
F7B478DB88ED,"We are living in a world full of possibilities in the day to day basis, where we could decide wether to go to Paris the next day or stay at home sleeping in bed. The question is what would be a better decision in this set of crossroads. What would make the most out of our short lives we have of living. Perhaps you'll be surprised of how much yoou can accomplish in this lifespan. Being active on a day to day basis has proven to create more happiness and more ""success"" throughout people's lifes.

I think the many witnesses we have of people who have lived a ""succesful"" life is enough of an example. We have heard stories of so many different people who have stood out on their field; celebrities, journalists, corporation leaders, etecetera. What do all of these people have in common? They never backed down from their dreams and took every step in their life in action towards that dream. People like Steve Jobs could've stayed in the comfort of their homes, idle, to the outside world and the possibilities that they had to create something that would transcendentaly change the world. But they decided otherwise, because of their denial to idealness they shaped and transformed the 21st century world as we know it. All the people who we remember and our taught about in our history classes, decided to live their lifes taking action to make a change.

But many times we don't have a goal to find the motivation to take action towards our life. It should be reminded that the actions we take don't have to be for our own desires. Instead taking action and denying to be ideal allows us the possibility of one of the greatest sources of happiness: service to others. We are constantly battered by a world that seems more disastrious everyday, everytime we watch the news we seem to be living in world full of lies and grief. Where innocent people suffer the consequences of actions that are not their own. By denying to idleness and reflecting about the world we live in, we allow ourselves to create an impact on other people's lives. Spreading joy and happiness and making a mark on their lives. While also creating happiness and fulfillment in our own lives.

Perhaps a more gruesome but at the same time important way to analyze the denial to idleness is asking ourselves these questions: ""When I leave this earth, what do I want to leave behind?"""" What do I want my legacy to be?"". Hopefully your answer isn't nothing. Because wether we believe it ourselves or not we all have the capacity, capability, and opportunity to leave a legacy that we are proud of. We are all the determinants of our legacy. Wether it be something of large scale involving the whole world or something related to your best friend. We are all most likely to want for people to remember us. Perhaps it's something chemical in our brains that makes us want this or perhaps we want to know that the time we spent on Earth was of some value. Perhaps in our last hours of living we want the reassurance of this very thing. And the only way to know that we will feel that satisfaction is by taking action today, no matter where you are or what you're doing. After all when people were asked in their last hours of living what do they regret doing, they said that they do not regret doing anything, that insted they regretted not doing the things they could've done. Taking action is the way to leave footprints on this earth, by taking steps forwards, backwards, to the right and left. And perhaps more than one of those steps will be facing the wrong direction but it's important to remind ourselves that we have to keep walking because that's the only way we will realize how much we can accomplish.

Taking action in your everyday lfe and the denial of idleness allows you the possibility to create the world you once thought you could only imagine. By stepping out and seeing what life has to offer wether that be a flower or a river, it is what allows us to accomplish our goals. And the denial of idleness helps you realize that there's people out there who want your joy put out on this world.

The first reason why the school board should not add one and a half hours to each school day is because all the students will got stress. Some students can get depression by learning to much. They don't want to study anymore because of the long day in school. They will get very tired of sitting all day. They will not do their homework because they have to memorize a lot of thing at school are ready. They don't have a lot of time left at home to study or do in their homework. They will not interesting in school anymore. That's the first reason why the school board should not one and a half hours for each school day.

The seconds reason why the school board should not extending the school day is because of the school program and activity will got delay. So if the school board add one and a half hours of school all the after school program will get delay. No more students want to stay after anymore because if to late. Just think about the transportation from the school. If a student live in a rural area they have to wake up at 5 A.M to get ready for school because from his/her house is one hours away for the school. If the student planning to stay after school she/he may not get home at 7 P.M. And he/she have to get home before 7 P.M to be available to do her/his homework.

Playing a sport is the best way to make our bodies stronger and healthy, it also helps us mentally when you are going through times going outside and playing helps you a lot. Playing a sport in school helps you have more energy and be ready to learn it likes opens your mind. Soccer for example is helps your body be stronger, Volleyball helps your hands be more stronger, Basketball helps you jump higher, and Football helps you run faster.

Writing or coloring the yearbook is a great idea too, because you are writing something that everyone is going to see so i know you gonna write neat and correctly. Coloring is good for our brains too it helps us be calm and out of stress. Spelling is one of the most important things and writing helps it improved it, coloring is something that not everyone knows how to do it, but by practicing we are gonna learn.

Serving in a student council helps you a lot because you learn something very important and thats learning how to communicate with other people and be nice. Sometimes its hard to communicate or talk to other people but we have to do it because sometimes the people needs someone to talk to and someone to be there for them.

Technology has had a big effect on humans from adults to toddlers all around the world in schools and in many other environments. With less communication due to technology may cause conflicts between people. You may have not been able to comprehend what was said or happened because you werent communicating. Not communicating causes people not to understand what you mean or where you are coming from in any situation if its in a relationship or friendship. Communication is something everyone should be comfortable to do and know about.

You dont really get to enjoy life as much because with technology you dont really focus on anything else that is happening around you. When your at family events you may be on your phone and not focusing on your family enjoying dinner, making funny jokes or opening up about something new and important to them. You may be at school and miss on all school events or the kindness of people around you. It does have a big impact on your family because you may care and love them but having technology around really makes them think otherwise.

This type of service allows people to be more confident on technology and it saves you some time. Therefore, manny people take advantage of the technology and use it for goods.

In adition to that, technology allows you to get to place faster and safer. For example, they have cars that are design to drive by themselves.

I can admit I've have been several of times, In my opinion distance learning is a wonderful idea. Students can move at their own pase , you can replay the lesson video as much as needed , and it will prevent you from failing a class.

School can be stressful expecially when you miss a day and you feel like your behind on everything. Then when the teacher explains it to you , If you don't understand you might not want to ask for him/her to repeat it again. This can be avoided by the power of distance learning you'll be able to have classes online so you can move at your own paste. You wouldn't have to worry about asking a staff or classmate what you missed. Also you can take notes and do your classwork whichever way it works best for you.

However some students are visual and independent learners they focus better when they work by themselves. Working in a group at times might not always be the best option. When reviewing for a test or quiz you can go back and reread ,study, and take notes on whatever you're struggling with. Those notes can be reviewed as much as you want. If you're a type of person that has to have things repeated to you multiple times this is a great opportunity for you.

Last but not least , Are you failing a class due to not having enough time to turn your work in? You would probably not have to worry about that anymore because you can do your work at anytime. In class you are given a time limit you have to turn in your assigment. When your doing it online yes im sure there is a due date but you're not told what time your suppose to start at. If your at sports practice or have any free time you can start working on it. In my opinion this will prevent you from failing a class because you can turn it in whenever your ready to.

To sum it up this is an amazing opportunity alot of students should be looking to attend. If your school is offering this to you I highly recommend it. It can keep you on track and motivate you to complete and turn your work in on time so you don't fall behind in class. You can move at your own paste without anyone rushing you. And lastly, you can replay and reread anything as you would like with no limits. This is a big help for students who want to reach their goal of earning a diploma.

It can help you do better in the class.

Therefore the harder they work,the more they achieve. their self-esteem will keep rising and then they start believing in themselves more.

Also other believe that praises for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. I agree with there opinion,I believe that there should be goals to reach and you must try your hardest to achieve. Their's always the chance the chance of failing but that just means to keep pushing, to fix the mistakes. And when you finally achieve your goal it makes you feel so much better about yourself. Also that builds you up for harder task.

Therefore some believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement. which I believe in too,feeling better about yourself works more when you have earned something. Also it can be anything but as long you give it your all,and achieve what is meant to be achieve. Your self-esteem is going to be built up knowing that you achieve something.

Next I don't believe in just praising someone no matter how good the job was works like that. Because you keep praising that they could do so much better on,it's just going to make the feel like they already got the job done,when they can do so much better. Praise their work when they tired there hardest,so then they can keep trying there hardest to achieve goals no matter what. That's how i believe that praising should be done and how to build self-esteem to make whoever try to best on anything, to not give just half but to give there all.

Finally does true self-esteem come from praise or does it come from achievement? It's come from earning achievement,so they know they give it everything they had to earn that achievement. praises work when you praise there best work so they can keep on trying there best on everything. It's takes them believing in themselves so they can earn achievement to build their self-esteem.      ",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0
FAA9FC1B315B,"In my personal opinion when some schools offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing I mostly disagree. Its not because I am attending a public high school. There are reasons why I mostly disagree about this situation.

One of the reasons why I disagree is because this might hurt the students communication skills.

when you have classes online you are not at the school you are home taking this class so you basically don't associate with anyone except your teacher now since i have never took a online class i wouldn't be able to tell if its better to not know no one or to associate with anyone but personally I just dont't thing it's good for students to attend online school if you are someone that like to work with people and not just your teacher. Other students also might be able to understand some stuff that you don't understand and that they should be able to help you. They won't be able to help you if you not there with them.

The second reason why I disagree and I really don't think that online schools is not beneficial is that it hurts your participation skills too. Here in school we do so much activities connected to things we are learning and it helps very much because if you do activities connected to the things we are learning it gets stuck in your mind. Its also better to ask questions and to understand better. There might be some stuff that you didn't understand face to face with your teacher its better to ask them like that and understand like that instead of emailing them or contacting them through different thing.

Also the teacher might not respond as soon as possible and that might be a problem and affect your grade and thats why its better to talk to your teacher face to face and deal with understanding face to face that's my second opinion.

My last and final reason is that you might get lazy and miss classes since you take it at your home . That might affect your grade too which is very risky if you're not a productive and committed person to your education online class is not for you. For example me personally it will not be good for me because I am a very lazy person i am pretty sure I

will miss classes either by sleeping in or some other unexeptalbe reasons . But also there are people that are very organized and careful people out here that can risk this for those kind of people online classes are good and they can take it because thy are committed to Finnish there education in a very careful way.

Those are my good reason why i don't agree with online classes it's a good thing that schools offer distance learning as an option for students if you have a good reason why you don't actually go to the school but personally i dont agree with this situation.

FAC8305E209D,"When I was working at the Daycare, it was not only me working and taking care of the kids, there was three more ladies doing the same job and working all together. So I think that is more benefit working in group that working alone because it make easily the things.

First, the first thing we do is give the kids breakfast, and while the kids are eating two of the ladies are looking after them, and the others two, are planning the activity that the kids are going to be doing during the day and try to keep them busy. Also all ladies give ideas and at the end we try to put all ideas together and work on it as a team.

While the day is passing, we do everything we need to teach and do the activities, and working all together is easily for us to finish early. when we finish early we always read or dance until the time to go home comes. Also we disgust who was the one that behave was good and we also give stars for the behavior to kids. Sometimes the kid don't behave well and if there were only one person taking care of the kids it most be difficult to do what we all four need to do.

Also, everyone goal is to keep the kids safe,having fun, and also learning who to write, so at the time for them go to school they are going to feel relative and don't be scare of going to a regular school. And when that happen is how we know that we make a work together.

As you see, I feel that is more beneficial working together in a group because, everyone in the group has ideas, is easily to finnish everything fast and also everyone has the same goal.",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,3.0

i have experience as working in a group we had to finish 6 palletes unless makeing it 2 left , we finished the pallets so quickly that we thought where gonna leave early but we got some together finished.

now working alone man.. that was challenging i tried finishing at least one but i couldnt because there was so much stuff in one pallet and i got to say i was new in that department , then thats when they sent me help.

FB5F33FEC99F,"Did you know that participating in after school activities or clubs benefits students educational wise?

Weather it's joining a sports team, or theater art, or even practicing an instrument, they all educate you in a way.

There are many activities that arent just educational, but students will also find enjoyable, such as sports, art and music.

There are many types of sports, football, basketball, soccer and many many more to choose from.

Sports teaches you a lot about health, and why it's important to stay healthy. It also helps you stay fit and in shape. Playing sports can also give you a scholar ship for collage, but all that a side it's also fun and enjoyable. You get to hang with your friends, compete with other schools and teams, carry the schools name, and most importantly win trophies and receive rewards.

At some schools, they even let you go on field trips to other states to fields and courts to compete with other teams.

It's nice to have so many people come and support you and cheer you on at games, even when it gets competitive.

Drawing, painting, doodling or crafting are all ways of art. Some students have a hard time expressing their feelings, so they do it through art. They express their feelings and emotions through the colors and the designs and subliminal messages they hide in their paintings.

Art clubs get to go to art museums and art gallery's that inspire and improve their talent.

They even get to do art competitions and win prices and art gallery's of their own to hang on the walls around the school. Painting or Drawing your mood is one way to enjoy yourself and become more passionate for the talent you have.

Art is very deep, interesting and meaningful,yet many people don't really understand art that much. It's fun to experiment with colors and textures, for art has no limit.

Many students join bands and music clubs simply because they enjoy playing or singing.

There are many different types of instruments to choose from, like band and string, but they are very different.

bands do not include string instruments, nor do string instruments include band.

Singing is also one of the ways students like to have fun and enjoy themselves, as well as playing there favorite instrument. Music is also art and a talent that not most people really have. students get to go to opera's concerts and very famous theaters to meet very famous musicians. They also get to preform on stages and before every school game, they also get to compete in music competitions were they get to earn and receive valuable rewards.

They also get to upgrade their instruments every year to the finest quality.

In conclusion, There are many activities that arent just educational, but also very enjoyable, like sports, art and music. Learning should not be all serious, strict and stressful,but should be fun, enjoyable and lovable. Education is important, but loving to learn is more important to sussed. These activities and clubs teaches students something new everyday and helps in developing the brain skills. Education is fun but sometimes it's good to be serious, or strict in some situations.                    ",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0
FB73ABAB1D14,"Students should have the right to elect their classes that they want to take in school, because it's all about in how capable the students are or how much the students can learn if they have the chance to elect their classes. It's hard for some students to learn a class that it have been given to him/her. Some students are born with special skills, they can handle many things at the time but not all the teenagers and the kids have the same ability. People should think more about just giving students classes without consulting with them about what their class are going to be. Some student might not have the skills that are needed to take the class that it has been given or the student might struggle with the class that it has received, because they didn't had the chance to tell their teachers or parents what they were capable of.

However, students should be allow to elect a class they feel more comfortable of in their school, and all the schools should be aware of letting students pick the classes or activities that they want to do or they want to learn more about, because It has been proved by scientists and experts, that the ninety-five percent of the majority of the students who elect their classes have become successful in their education path because, students have developed different types of skills that are based in a careers that they want to do in their future, that it became easy for them to manage after all the experience they have gotten, after choosing something they liked while being in school.

The majority of students do not consider music or drama classes important for their education, it's something that you are inspired by to do. Music, art, and drama these classes can be a distraction for students not to focus in their school work and it might affect their education status. Most of the students from the age of ten years and up are still developing their brains and they can get easily distracted. Most of the parents in the

U.S they won't let their kids watch TV for more than thirty minutes, because they can create a habit and they will spend more of their time watching TV, playing video games and more.

In addition, for those students who are forced to take art or drama classes etc, this choices can lead teenagers or kids to fall into a level of depression, for not having the chance pick something they like to do in school. Parents and school teachers should let students know that they can also practice any sport in school, this method would keep students exercise and healthy. Overall, students should have the last word of what they want to learn in school and parents should be aware of that.

In my life experience, I have become successful in the things that I have done while being in school, because my parents always told to pick something that I would like from school, and I choose to practice sports and after choosing something that I considered good for me and my future, I received an scholarship for soccer. All this happened after my parents gave me the opportunity to decided what it was good for me and my future. I completely disagree with the people believing that students should be require to take music, drama, and art classes, because all of this might take all the good opportunities away from your child and it will become a distraction for them.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0
FC2050EA9039,"The world is full of new things that can help make you an outstanding person. Trying something new will help you grow physically and mentally. Even if you don't believe you can do it, you can always try and see. I will prove that trying new things above your skill can make any person grow.

Attempting something above what you already mastered can make you the best at whatever you love to do . If I was playing soccer for example, there are many positions to try. If I am already a great striker, why not try playing a defender position that I have never thought to do. This will make me a valuable asset to my team and i will grow with new skills. You can even grow academically by trying new things.

It can't hurt to try something hard once in a while. When I am learning math, it doesn't make sense to try and understand a concept that won't make a difference to me, but it prepares me for harder problems in the future. If I do a difficult problem that I can't grasp, it is said that it only helps my problem-solving skills. There is no reason why it's not possible to master difficult problems.

Other would say that some people have limits to their abilities. They argue that a person who is stuck can not grow. They are wrong because it's not so much a person can't grow but don't have the support or energy to want to be able to achieve higher. Sometimes they have have issues with their self-esteem. I believe that every person can grow to a certain extent.

In conclusion, I agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson on his statement. A person that does not try new things above their own abilities will never grow. Based on my experiences, I understood that trying something I never mastered will only make me grow as a person.                                                  ",3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5

There is a program that make you work with some older than you but how are you and the other person benefiting from this program. This are how the program can help you and the other person by: Learning how to cooperate with other people, practicing social skills and how rely on each other.

One thing you and your partner can learn is how to cooperate with one another. There are people that do not like to work with other people and maybe one of those person is your partner. When you are working with someone else you have to cooperate because working together is essential for a good team. Without communication between you and your teammate, nothing will really work because you have to be able to express your ideas and understand your partners point of view, you have to work together so it can be a successful team so you will have to cooperate if you want it to work.

Social skills are very important and you can learn or practiced them with you partner. People like to talk and know how to start a conversation with other people, but there are people that are really shy. People that are shy struggles with staring conversations or making their ideas clear. If you are a shy person and you are on the program, try to practice your social skills with your partner because I think that they are going to understand your situation and they will not judge you by that, so you should not feel uncomfortable. You can try to practice social skills or even learn new ways to start a conversation and be less shy.

How to rely on other people is important. When you are with someone else and you do not understand something, you should ask them because they are there to assist you and help them when they do not understand something too. There is a limit on relying on other people because you should try to solve your problem but if you could not solve it, it is the perfect moment to ask your partner,otherwise, you will be a person that have a problem and it will be asking its partner all the time even if you could have solve it by yourself. There are limits for things, you should try because if you never try you are not going to be able to learn anything.

In conclusion, been with someone older than you can be helpful because they have a lot of knowledge and are able to understand other people situation. What can both learn from this program is how to work to together, new ways to make new friends, or practice social skills and rely on someone to help you but not all the time because you should try first.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0

Technology can be educational for students and teachers. For example teachers can tell students to download apps that are used for education and students can learn on there. Many people think technology isn't educational, but it is because students uses online resource to lean new things.

Today, many people living in U.S. and people has many attitude, and some peoples has good attitude that key to success in life, others has not good attitude. Although, some people think that attitude is not important to the life because of it is dependents on how you work harder, one might think that positive attitude is the key to success in life because you do not stuck in same problem, you could become strong, you could have many supporters.

First, you do not stuck in same problem. If you have problems about your job or in your life, and you do not know how to fix your problems, but If you have positive attitude you could think positive way to your problem, and do not need spend the so much time for your problems. At the least, you can figure out fix your problem more good way and you will doing to be great in your job or your life. When I was middle school I was playing basketball, and I had problem that I always think about If I miss this shoot and scared to shoot in the game, but I changed think to positive way that I can do it, I will make it. So, I really enjoyed every game and I did make it so many score in the game.

Second, you could become strong. If you did big mistake in your job or in relationship, of cause at the first you will be sad, but you could change to positive way quickly so you will work harder and you could fix mistake. Two years ago I was dating with boy that he goes to same school, but we did not work out not longer. I was so d and I was cried every day, but my mom told me that ""you will be fine, glow up and become strong then make him jealous"". So, realized that stay in sad mood everyday is not good for me, and I changed to think positive way and I focused more about myself, I did my makeup, I bought new cute clothes. And my ex boyfriends asked me to If you want mo to back together, but I said no because I knew he will hurts me again, but I was so happy that I could make his jealous and I told myself that I win then at the same time felt strong.

Third, you could have many supporters.

FE1D0E5EA2EB,"The Author Waldo Emerson wrote ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"". I agree with Waldo Emerson's quote because if theres someone thats trying to make you something that your not, being yourself will be a very duanting task. When I was in the 8th grade someone who I thought was one of my friends wanted me to change who I was because they though that I was'nt cool enough to hangout with anymore, at first i thought that I was the problem, but I learned that true friends won't try to change who you are, no mather what. Being yourself is one of the hardest things you can try to do, possible because your to shy, you don't think your good enough, your scared of what others will think of you.

I always hated thinking about myself because i never though that I was good enough for anyone or good enough to do anything, so I kept everything bottled up inside, at one point or another I even thought about killing myself but was to scared to do antthing to try anything. So I decided acted like everything was ok untill I tricked my self into belaveing that I was happy, but that did'nt last. Now i'm in the 11th grade I came across a certen individuality(my current girlfriend) who, when I around, can't stop feeling real happyness. Everyday I think about how lucky I am to have met her. The Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment, as an individual I agree with his quote because in this world not everone wants to see you sucssed in your efferts.",3.0,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
FE3CA06DDCA1,"Why is it when someone asks you for advice there the one's talking most of the time? Here are 2 of the reasons I think that the person who asks for advice talks more than the one who is giving the advice. Reason 1 is they might want to give the on who is giving the advice all the info so then they can help them. Reason 2 is that they are give you as much detail as they have to give you good advice.

They will want to give you all the information so you can probably find a solution or fix to there problem. As in this sit ions where my friend needed some advice for a test she had coming up. She was not sure what to do to study for it. She was telling me what she had to study but then she said  I dont think these would help me much I told her to make flash cards out of the note she had then she did that. She was super stress. I think when your stressed you just say things that are on your mind as in you talk more.

If a person wants good advice they will want to give you all the details. If you know all the details you will most likely know how t fix it. Everyone needs so good advice because the how are they going to fix there problem. If you friend has a problem and they dont tel you all the details your not really gonna give then good advice.

In conclusion why you need advice you will talk more then the person who is given you the advice. When you are in a problematic event you will take a lot more because yo will be most likely stressed. Also if you give all the the details of your problem you will get good advice. ",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5

FE69FBDD5681,"Is learning online a gift? Students should attend to classes from home because that way the students would have more time to study or do homework, the students would get less distracted, and the students would learn better if they feel more comfortable.

Students would have more time to study, or do homework because they could start school later on the day, or students could start early it depends on how the students feel. Students would feel better if they had a better rest, or knowing they could do school whatever time they feel good.

The students would get less distracted if they learned from home because they are not around their friend or peers, who are usually a distraction. Of course the students will get bored of being alone while doing school but it's better for them to stay focused on what they are doing, and plus they have a better understanding on what they are doing if the students don't get distracted. The students would be more dedicated on the homework's, tests, or projects because they would understand a lot more if they are not distracted by their friends.

The students would learn a lot more if they are comfortable for example people pay more attention when they are in their rooms on their beds or when at their house. Students would rather sit on a comfortable chair rather than a school chair because when your sitting on the same chair everyday your body starts to hurt, or you don't feel comfortable sitting in that position.

Students should have the opportunity to attend school from home because its more beneficial for them, they have a better timing, they are more comfortable when working from home, and they would get less distracted from other students.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5
FE6EC11C8877,"Should you relied on yourself or other about life's important matters?

Its important that people relied on their own instincts and ideas because if we have people picking chooses for others we would have no power on what we want, for example people who learn from them self are more active and confidant then the ones that have to learn from other, and wait for instructions. I belieave that people should relied on them selfs for two reasons. My first reason is that every one makes mistakes, and thats were we learn to not do them again. Infact when you make mistakes is better because you get to try again and you get to do it even better, there for to succesed in life you will have to fall, and get back up in to your feet to try again and do it better. My second reason is that if you let others choose for you, you will never learn to deal with hard thinking situations. Also you get to learn more about your self and you get to do stuff your own way and you also learn to love your self from your mistakes. I think that every person should make there own choose when it comes to hard momemts like when my grandma die my parent pick what we was going to do with her, and she didnt go ask some one what to do, no she knew what to do from expiriens of my grate grandma, and thats why some problems have to be dealt by your self. In conclusion its important that people learn to think and do things own there own so they wont spend money on others telling them what to do, and also not relied on somes help from others, some chooses are hard and some are easy but every choose you make, makes you up and shows who you really are.

FE8B7167BD93,"Working in a group is better

People in this days are deciding rater to work in a group or work alone. There is a lot of good and bad things between these two options. Most people may choose to work in groups for differents reasons. Here are some of the reason why I think that working in group in better than working alone. Some people like to work in groups because they like to finish faster, also it is a good choice because the information taht you need to look for is divide with all the group members, finally it is good because you meet new people in the group to work with.

The first reason why working in a group is better than working alone is because you can finish faster. For example if you work by your-self on a big project you are going to take more time to finish it. Probably you can finish it on time but you are going to spend a lot of time then you. Then if you work in a group everybody in the group can hellp to get it done more fast. With the help of all the members the work is going to be done on time and you are going to have more time for yourself. With more time for yourself you can play video games, watch your favorite show or take a good time to study for another class or a test.

Another reason why working in a group is a benefit rater than work alone is because you divide the information about the topic with all the members of the group. For example if you are in high school and you get a big project then there is two choices to do it by yourself or work in group. I think most people in your class will prefer to work in groups because there will be a lot of information to look for. In a group all the members are going help in the project to get a good grade. Everybody are going to be proud of what they did together. Also they can be the best project on the class.

The last reason why working in groups is better than working alone is because everybody in the group meet new people. For example in your class you do not talk to all your classmates and this is a good opportunity to talk to them. Maybe in the past you were thinking that they were bad people but doing the project together that let you know that they are awesome. Meeting new people is good because sometimes others may feel alone and letting yourself meet them and letting them meet you, both are going to feel a different way. Sometimes what we just need is a good friend to talk and to do homework with. Some people are going to be disagree with this idea because they may not like to meet new people or because they like to be by their selves.

In conclusion working in groups is a good choice because it has good benefits. You can get more time for yourself by finishing faster with the help of your group members. You have lest information to look for because there are other members that are looking for other information. Finally you can meet new people and became a friend of them. There are some other benefits that help to work in a group and understand more about a topic with the halp of all the members.",4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,2.5,4.0

FF8BAC351714,"I disagree with the students attend classes form home or vidoe conferencing the reason why i diagree with this online thing is that one of are student will not get on, they will fall asleep and they will not do there work the by them doin gthis alot of kids can fail reason why i say this things because i know students im am one; that me explain to you why I say this .

The frist reason why I said students will not get on because they will be like i get on next time and keep on saying in till they think it not useful at all then they will not get on and just go outside and play with there friends or sometimes there Mom or Dad have to keep telling to get on and they migth not listen to them or just get on there ps4 or phone .

Number two reason is that they can fall asleep while on it and the teacher cant do nothing about it but if we was at class a real class they can tell us to get up and make sure we doing what we suppost to do by going to class that can make the teacher work way more easy for them.

Last reason but not least is that they will not do there work they will get on but how can you know they the one doing it they can get someone eles that they know or just pay them to do it for them teen are bad but smart. However other migth say the students attend classes form home is the best thing they can do because they dont need to do all that monring things they can just open the laptop and join there teacher form the web cam and learn but other cant learn like that they need someone rigth next to them so the students can understand more better.
