The technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person. Has the limitation of human contact due to use of the technology had positive or negative effects on peoples lives. in my opinion there are more negative than positive effects about technology

One of a negative effect is. Play games without speaking. We should meet the person first than start to play with that person. instead of play via any web with someone that we do not know who is.

There is another negative effects, kids, and teenagers are able to be in contact with bad people. like kidnappers, this are bad people who take advantages of the technology attacking the most vulnerable in technology the kids make the kids feel confident, and feel they are their friend. there are pedophiles too, looking for kid and teenagers.

Also, because of the technology many frauds are occurring every day hackers stolen some of our personal information. Like our names, address, social security number, banks accounts information, and make frauds to companies.

In conclusion, I believe that the technology has many negatives effects in our social lives

It is bad for our kids, and our information in risk, I wish we could find a safety way to use it.  ",3.0,2.0,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5

Some students think its best to have a healthier lunch and not the same one.

Students always have something different to eat. Some students get bored of eating the same lunch here and there so, why not have a healthier lunch. If the change in the menu where to happen most students would not get bored or complain about their food. Although, one can see that not most of the students enjoy their lunches they mostly just play around with their food on their trays. while some are actual eating.

Some prefer to stay with the same menu. Some would not agree with the change in the lunch menu. However, Others prefer the idea of having the healthier lunch instead of the other lunch menu. On the other hand, Some do not want the change just because of their favorite food on the other menu. But if they try it they might find out hey like something new.

Provides more nutrients. If the cafeteria where to start to give healthier foods in the menu. Students would have the right amount of energy for the rest of the day. This means if they ate a healthier lunch they would not fall asleep for the remainder of class or classes.

036042533396,"Do you ever feel like giving up just because you failed and you feel like nothing is going your way ?

In this paper i will argue that '' success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasms''

Sometimes it's okay to feel upset,mad and frustrated when you think you're trying your best and it seem like. Nothing it's working out for you .

Failure is the way to success and some people seem not okay with it. Most people also don't understand why it has to be like this. However we don't always get what we want in life and that's a fact. Because that's just the way it is you can't blame yourself for it either. Most of us think that you have to be successful the first time you try something. But sadly that's not how works for some of us but some are just lucky.

I remember a few years back when my Aunt Generic_Name open her second beauty salon. She was quite upset because nothing was going the way she wanted to and how she planned. It wasn't going well she felt like everything was falling apart. She started to lose a lot of costumers the first year she open the salon. But 2 years later she started to promote her beauty salon again. She kept trying till she achieved her goals and now everything going well for her. I think one the things that helped her a lot was her positive attitude towards everything. She also didn't lose her enthusiasm. I think this is a good example of ''success consist of failure''

Some of us might not agree that ''Success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.''

I know a few people that don't have this mentality. Just because you weren't successful doesn't mean you're not going to be ''somebody''. Or that you need to stop trying because it's not meant for you. But they are wrong because at the end of the day what matters is what you think you're capable of doing and what you can do.

Don't let others people get to you and keep hoping for the better. Another good example is most of the big celebrities that we know now days like Oprah,Ellen DeGeneres and many more were turn down before had disappointments and maybe gave up for a moment . But they never lost their '''enthusiasms'' and they made their dreams come true and pretty much that's how you become successful in life.

From time to time you need to start taking those ''Failures'' as a lesson and just keep trying to do better. Because that's how life is. Because you attempt to do something and it didn't go your way doesn't mean you have to put it aside. We are humans we make mistakes. But you just can't give up easily and losing hope. It's not an option either you just have to keep pushing and like people say ''Fake it till you make it .''

In the future i hope people start realizing that opportunities come and go. There's nothing wrong with failure. I'm pretty sure we all been there before and it's okay to feel like crap. But it's not okay to stop trying just because one door closes many more can open for you. You can go as far as you want to because you're the only one that can stop you from being successful.

Some people say that the first impressons are almost impossible to change nevertheless, a person can easily change his/her first impressions because, human is a developed creature that can easily keep moving and change the first impressions with his/her ideas and experiences. It should not even be a doubt for the people who already faced this situation and has developed ideas.

Some of the people says that the first impression is important. Yes, it is important. This is your first look to a person or another thing. It is easy to be impressed or shocked. But it is easy to go over it and change it. Almost everyone has their own ideas, not just the person who impresses. Another person can come with better ideas than that person. An average person is developing his/her ideas since kindergarten. Maybe by language, maybe science/math, maybe sports/arts. But almost everyone has their developed ideas. Even if they think that they don't have any ideas,

they are using their familiy's ideas. The person's family helps to create their mindset since they are born.

A person is getting in this impression situation certain times in their life. Unfortunately there are some people who can't keep moving after the first impression. They keep their mind set impressed to that person for forever. But also there are some people that can easily get rid of that awful experience and can keep moving. Because they know that they can easily go over this situation and can change it. Even a person can live like he/she never experienced that moment to keep their mind clear. A person has his/her own idea that could easily go over impressons and change it.

Is there any other way to change the first impression? Absolutely. A person always gain experiences from born to death. Even though the first impressions are confusing and shocking, it is not a problem for people. Because they already experienced this situation. They already failed it or succeed it. It is hard to solve the first impressions that the person faces. But that is the keypoint. By keep failing it they learn how to succeed it. They learn how to go over it. A person never ever should be shy for failing to handle this situation. No one is successful in their first experiences, even in their 10th-20th experiences. This is how a person gain experience and learns how to go over this first impressions. Because they already faced it and went over it.

Yes, the first impressions are important and it could be shocking too. But a person can easily change this first impressions with his/her ideas and experiences.

My favorite thing to do over there is to help the bakers make bread and also to be with my family. Mexico also has good mexican food that you will probaly like. There are other places i would like to travel to but i choose Mexico because it's my moms hometown, theres a lot to do,and because i get to see my grandma,uncles,aunts,and cousins. Mexico is my favorite place to visit because i get to hang out with my old friends and go to the pool and swim til i get tired.

When i was little my mom would take me to the zoo a lot with my friends and we would have a blast. Sometimes i wish to live over there cause it's an amazing place to be at, but sometimes i don't cause i would have to go to school over there and i would have to learn how to write and read in spanish, which im not very good at.

047BD3CB80B4,"Should students have the option to take online classes? Yes, I believe that students should have the opinion to take those online classes and that no one should take those classes away from those students. Students can be more active when they are at home then at school. You can pick a time to start your online classes and have a fixed schedule. It is important for students to have the education of there own way instead of worrying about how public/private schools are run.

Most students attend to focus more when they are taking online classes; For an example, Students dont have to worry about how teachers are teaching students when they are in a class full of other students. Students tend to struggle when teachers aren't teaching their students properly and care more about there monthly payments. Second example, is that having that one-on-one connection. Having that bond with your teachers are great ways to not be afraid to ask question when you dont get a problem or how to get the answers to the homework. Third example, most students tend to be antisocial at school because thats how they were born or even scared that people around them with judge the student and that the students wanna feel safe at school.

My second argument is that students tend to get bullied at school; Bullying is a huge thing around the world and that bullying is a serious problem; Bullying is the number one cause of student not attending to school and not getting the proper education they need: For an example, when the student is taking an online class, they dont have to worry about other students picking on him, but instead he can feel safe and really enjoy the education that he is learning online at home. There was this one time that one of my really close friends was being made fun of and picking on him everyday at school. He would sometimes not attend to school because he was too scared to come in to class and would always worry about the other students. He would not focus on his school work, but would mostly focus about protecting himself.

My Third argument is that students can ask question when they are having that one-on-one with the teacher. Students are afraid to ask a not so good questions in math, English, history, etc. Students have that nerve racking moment when a teacher tells the class if they have any questions. There was this one time that a teacher asked the class if there were any questions and none of the students raised their hands because I felt like everyone knew what they were doing in the class but me. I was having that moment that I didn't wanna waste the other students time about my question that I didn't understand on. It was the judgment that they would give me, but I know that it wasn't the case, people tend to over think about the problem inside the classrooms. For an example, Extroverts tend to not talk/socialized to people often, instead they don't talk to others and the problem that they are having trouble with and scared to ask the teacher because they feel insecure about talking or feel uncomfortable talking to others.

In conclusion, Students should have the option to take an online class and enjoy learning like everyone else should. Learning is a fun thing to do, but have different learning styles in life. The world keeps changing everyday now and new technology is developing overtime.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0

Also Some times they does not have idea with what they have to pick or they have to do in there life .So, They need some one to find a good ideas from them. Some people keep his ideas with him/her self and think over. They get depression all the time with them life's. also they start doing other bad thing to get out from them depression. Fore example, drink alcohols.

I think sometimes we need some life's guidance to make a dissciocion for our life. because everyone think too many thing all the times. but, when we get confused with our own ideas. It is help full to share and to see guidance. we have to see guidance from experts and authorities about life's to make a good dessicion.

For example, when I start think about something hard and straggle to get a good idea. I always share my ideas with some one who can understand and help me with my idea. If

I got a good ideas form them I keep that ideas for my own life. so its better to share your ideas with people from experts and authorities about life's important matter.

People who decide his won idea with his self and sharing his own idea for other people and making a decision. Making a decision with other peoples are help full to make a good decide. because they find anther good think with your idea or they will tell you the bad thing about your ideas. So you can make you own decision after that thats help full to now your weekness.

So making decision with life guidance is help full to make a good decision for life.

057EE790CCEA,"Pursuit of success what is success mean? Do success really consists of going from failure to failure withour give up? What do I think about success? Do I know what succes mean? Have I feel success about something that I did? Do I know anybody that success after a lot fail withour loss their snthusiasm? Have I ever give up in something that I thought never could be success on it? Do I agree with churchill's statement about the important role that failure play in the pursuit of success?

Which is my opinion?

First of all, to me success is to be good at what you do, cooking, driving, boxing, flying, playing sport or teaching it dosn't matter what it is, if you are good on it you are going to be succesful. And yes. I believe that to be success really consists on going from failure to failure withour give up. because sometime we need to know how it feel to fail in order to feel what is success mean. you know. To me those people that didn't work hard, don't know how failure feel like are the one that faster go down, cuz they don't care about it, unti they got there.

My thinking about success, is the that's the best moment of a person who fighting and fighting for what he or she wants withour giving up unti his/her last breath. You know. One year ago when I went to my country, I hear a lot of peaple saying this guy die unhappy cuz he didn't enjoined at all what he work so hard to accomplish. and then the guy who was the death guy bestfriend and partner said. he didn't die unhappy cuz he die doing what he wanted to do all his life. Later I began to think about that ask to myself is really important fight and fight to success in something and I know that everyone there did the same because they all stay quiet for a few secands. And after that. success to me is be good at what you want, fight for it, and be happy.

Since I remenver my family telling me, that the most important things on life are those that you make by you on. You know. My family are very poor people. So when I was like 11 yuears old I deciIde to get a job, so I could buy things like pencil, pen thigs like that and went to my neighbor have a factory of cofe and he pay me like 1 dollar but in dominican money every day. In a few day a lot of pencil, and a began to sell then. I never had to be worrie for those things any more or money for project. I guess that time feel really seccesful I was doing something the really worked.

I have a friend who is now a professional boisboll player, he fail a lot of time the test to be a professional beisboll player because he didn't had what was needed to pass it, and he didn't give up until pass it. He was so happy that they. i have had give up in a lot of things. looking back now that I think about if I will put more enthusiasm on it, maybe I would success.

I gree with winston churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of successs. because I know how it feel fail, and success. I know many people who had afil, and fail, and fail, and then success.

05ACEDBB9CB4,"A lot of students become involved in extracurricular activities, and that makes them don't have time enough to finish their homework and assignments. Schools should control student's involvement in extracurricular activities, because sometimes students can't make their own decisions in the right way and that will makes them don't focus a lot on their studying and education.

My first reason that the schools should control students' involvement in extracurricular is the student can involve in a lot of activities after school or during the school time that can make him be late to do his homework and he will be tired to study; and that makes him have a bad grades and he wouldn't have a good future.

Secondly, when the schools control the student's involvement that make the student more successful in his classes and that give him the chance to finish all of his assignments on the time; also that makes him more understandable to what is happening in all of his classes.

The third reason that the school should control the students involvement is the student will know how to spend his time in a right way and saving his time to the important things that would help him in his future, and makes him more responsible about his education and future.

Lastly, if the schools control the students involvement in extracurricular activities, they would know how and when the student become involved and they would know if the students would have time to the activities or not.

That was the reasons about how the schools should control the students involvement in activities and how it is good for the student's education and future on the same time. Because students can't make their own decisions; sometimes they feel that somethings good for them but it is not, so they need someone more mature to show them the right ways and right things.

05F30981F3EB,"Imagine if online schooling was offered at every school. Schools are offering online classes for students to attend class. Also schools offer video conferencing online to help benefit at home. This is important because some students are not responsible to get to school on time. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because health issues play a major role through out the school year, students can become smarter by taking time to learn the content, students would not have to stress over transportation.

Certainly some might think staying in the house all day causes bordom to do school work. Others believe students tend to need help from an adult to understand that content. Still others argue by feeling alone will not motivate them to be productive.

To begin with, health issues play a major role through out the school year on students. Students always tend to come to school while they are sick. So that spead germs through out the school and causes major illness. Spreading germs can have someone hospitalized and in bad condition. Which can make students have bad attendince. Also parents would loose jobs to attend to their sick child. However staying home and still be able to do your school work causes less stress. Because it gives student more time to be able to complete there assignments. Another reason way online classes will help out students that are in wheel chairs, crutches, and broken legs. Is they dont have to be rushed, pushed, in the crowded halls. Therefore they feel more safe and have enough space at home. Parents will be able to supervise their child more. An not be worried that something else might happen. Health issues should be a cause of not being able to not attend school if you are able to do it from home.

Secondly students become smarter doing the research on their own to retain the information. Every student have a diffent way to learn. Some students need day's to understand the content. An some can understand the content off the first try. Also some student need to see it hands on then be supervised as they complete the task. Witch is also not a bad way to retain information. If help is needed the video conferencing will help out in the long run. Being able to home relax and still manage to completed your school work motivates the student to remain on task. Another reason why is grades will have a major increase and students would maintain a higher grade point average. The best part of the video conferencing is the student will be able to replay it if needed. Instead of hearig it once in class from a teacher then forgetting the information the next time you have that subject. Apart of life that is important to have is knowledge, so being able to teach and perfect your weakness are important.

Lastly transportation is a mojor problem for students. Some students have to walk, get droped off, or take the bus to get to school on time. Most students are not responsible to wake up on time to catch the bus. The students that walk are stessed, because they have to walk while its raining, hot, ride their bike, cold, and dark. In conditions like that are not safe for students to go through is something happend to them. Most of the time parents have to work and be worried that their child get to school safe. Having the privaledge to be home and do work will prevent fights, childish students, and angery teachers. So everyone would have peace and respect for one another and learn more. There will be no disagreement and aultications with students and teachers. After school students will not have to rely on transperations, because they are already home. Less stress can be taken off of adukts that are nor responsible for you. Having to find transpertation to your destination is worth money and not everyone is forchen to loan out money all the time.

Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because health issues play a major role through out the school year, students can become smarter by taking time to learn the content, and students would not have to stress over transportation. If students was able to stay home and do school work the it would be less confusion in school. Keep calm and remain focus even if times get hard on your shoulders.        ",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0

One thing I would like to accomplish in the future is to live in a big mansion in California. Because I've never lived in some type of big house before. Since I've been born I've been living in small places with other little house nearby like town houses or apartments and for me It has me thinking. ""Why am I living in these places like I have some friends who live in houses but I don't?"" But that was me when I was like little but now I know that some parents aren't as lucky as others and they struggle to find nice places to live in but they get what they can get and at least they get somewhere to live in and give their kids what they need and want so for me It's going to be hard finding a job with good paying money but if i get a degree in something I want to do then It would be amazing to do that.

Another reason I would like to live in a big mansion is that It will show how rich I am and It was hard trying to buy a Mansion. Mansions these days cost so much money (of course because they are big in space and some are in private places) you can find mansions in Florida, Texas, Nevada, California, and etc. But mainly I would love to get one in California. California is a big wealthy state with many great known cities and history. It is mostly visited in the summer for its hot temperatures and great attractions. One city I would love to buy my mansion is maybe in Calabasses or Hollywood, There are many cities to get a mansion it just depends on how much it costs and how big it is on the inside and out.

Last reason I would like to live in a big mansion is that it would be my first time going to California. My mom used to live in California, in a small city near Downtown Los Angeles called Generic_City. She moved from Generic_City to California when she was fourteen (which is my age currently) and she went to high school in Generic_City and learned English there and had a job. but then after finishing one year of college she moved to Virginia and had me when she was around twenty-five. But ever since then she has been telling me stories of how it was for her in California and what places she would visit over there like Disneyland, the Hollywood sign, sporting events, and more places. I would like to visit San Francisco with one of it's famous attraction the Golden Gate Bridge or Go down to Venice Beach and enjoy the beautiful ocean and it's hot temperature to cool off.

And those were my three reasons of why I want to live in a big mansion in California because I've never lived in some type of big house with no houses that are connected together, It will show all the hard work that payed off o get the house, and It will be my first time going to California.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0
076262AA0CD5,"The Curfews Keep Teenagers Out Of Trouble

Once, I walked down the empty street during midnight. Then, I heard a rising sound of a strange footstep behind me. Suddenly, I felt anxious and scared that someone might come up to me and murder me for money. Lucikly, there was nothing happened to me. After I got home, I had a thinking that what if a city council adopts a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers. If the curfew is published, any teenager who is wandering on the street after those hours would be violating the law. On the other hand, some might believe that the curfews unfairly interfere in young people's lives because it does not let the teenagers have their freedom and accomplish something that is very important to them, which they cannot do it another time. I still agree with the idea that curfews keep teenagers out of trouble because it stops teenagers from doing something that is illegal during the late hours, it moderates them to be a better humans being with molarity without having any criminal records, and it prevents young people from being kidnapped or killed at night.

Some people argue that curfews should not be publish because it limits the freedom of most teenagers. Still, I believe that curfews should be establish to put an end on any illegal act that is commited by teenagers because the young people should be controlled by laws when most of them are not mature enough. They should be strictly managed instead of being free and are allowed to do whatever they want. For example, teenagers who hangout with their friends at night and get drunk are more likely to do something that is breaking the law when they are not sober enough. These young people tend to pull out their weapons to threat others who walk outside at night for money in order to buy illegal drugs. This is an important issue to pay attention on because these teenagers already become the worst humans being when they are not strictly managed by anyone or any law. However, they will keep threatenting others when the curfews aren't carried out to prevent them from doing their vicious things. In fact, there are several criminal cases that are committed by teenagers in America, which proves that the U.S. government is weak at controling their citizens and managing the society within the nation. This fact shows that the U.S. government does not care about the moral of young citizens and the safety of all citizens in general. The U.S. government should carry out curfews that keep all teenagers in control in order to limit any illegal acts. The estalishment of curfews is important because it shapes all teenagers to become the better people who has morality instead of threatening others to get what makes them feel pleasure.

The curfews should be carrried out to moderate all teenagers into better people who treats others in the right way because it helps them stay out of any trouble that might be an unfortunate consequense in their future. It shapes their morals and erases all their bad behaviors that makes others feel unpleasure. For example, teenagers who turn out to be good people when they have parents who do not let them go out when the sky turns dark. Also, their parents strictly manage them and prevent them from going outside at night to do illegal things. However, some might believe that the curfews do a little improvement on teenagers because they still sneak out of their houses without their parents' awakeness to do what they like at night. This is an important issue to focus on because these teenagers will turn into adults who have several criminal records that might bother them from getting their jobs in the future. Moreover, teenagers should be more mature to realize that any violation acts that they had done will stay with them for the rest of their lives. Therefore, if the curfews is adopted then they should be obey to this law in order to avoid any unfortunate results that can occur in their lives. In fact, many companies prefer to choose employees with a good moral because they did not commit any crime in the past, which proves that they will not cause any danger while working in the companies. Unfortuantely, people who had done any crime or violated any law in the past will more likely to stay unemployed because they are considered to be dangerous. The curfews is brought out to protect all teenagers's future from being damaged by any of their wrongful commitment.

The curfews keep teenagers out of trouble because most of them would not want to be kidnapped or murdered while walking on the street at night. To prevent any harmful cause that can happen to young people, the U.S. government should set up curfews for teenagers. In fact, there are many unfortunate cases of missing teenagers in America. This fact proves that numerous teenagers had been kidnapped while they wander around empty public places at night. In this case, the U.S. government should adopt curfews law because it can decrease the act of kidnapping teenagers. However, some teenagers are killed while they are going out at night because there are a lot of robbers appear during this time. To solve this problem, the U.S government should let the city council bring out the curfews law, which can restricts all teenagers from going out at night and protect them from being murdered.

In conclusion, curfews law is significant because it can reduce the criminal acts within a society. It shapes the society to be more organized and less dangerous to the citizens. The curfews can keep teenagers out of trouble because it restricts teenagers from committing any unfortunate crime. It helps teenagers to become better individuals in society who treat others in a correct way. Specially, teenagers can avoid death and being kidnapped when they obey to the curfews and stay home at night. Lastly, we should set up curfews and believe that it can protect all teenagers from getting trouble because they are going to be the one who runs the planet one day.",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5

People know, is the biggest goal to be better day by day and be the good example for a future family.

In part is right like what it's said before, every single one is a different world, people can see how others live or sometimes criticize of others life, some people want to copy thing from other may be because are jealous of how other live with good cars, house, clothes, luxury things what others expect to have, no one is perfect but some people appear to have the best life, no body has to have billions of money to be happy if people have love and a big heart and charity to others and is no matter the race, religion or economic position, be the best example for those who need direction in theirs life, young people need orientations, discipline, best prospects of life.

This also can be so bad because in the family if the father go out with friends and came back very drunk, the kids may see that, and sometimes the drunk father can be aggressor with the kids and the wife, the father is giving a big bad example to those kids, and this is totally real, if people watch the television and see the news is a lot of people how died every single day not just for aggression in the house also out side when the family are driving and sometimes the father or the mother or both are drunk and they crash the car on the highway, a lot of things, parents have the responsibility if the kids are so little but when the kids growth they will be take their own decisions.

Many people change to a good way or a bad one but everyone have to know that is fine the life is only one, everybody is free to take all the depositions what people want, but with clear mind and the responsibility this can effect so much to those who are very closer, more for those who are young, parents are the most important example, there is the rot, parents have the responsibility of educate the kids, talk with theme, be the best friend, that way the kids are learning and expressing the thinks, dreams, and goals for the future, what the kids want to be, kids can think more clearly when the parents are always there giving counsels, talking like a friend.

everybody see and criticize each other, sometimes people talk so bad thing, everyone have account people are different than others.

07A4DAFDE5B7,"Hello, Mr: Principal.

I'm writing to you this letter to inform you about our responses about changing the school manu.

I'm a senior student in your high school. I really want to thank you about approving the idea of chenging the school manu to a new healthier and bigger one. We really appreciate that.

Some of us have a bad experince about the unhealthy food and the schol old manu.

one of them is PROPER_NAME he hate the spicy food and once before he tried it by mistake from the cafeteria, his stomach hurt him and he was throwing up all the day, and all of that because of the un healthy food.

And also I will tell you sir about my own experince, I still remember, when I was a kid I had one of the worst days on my entire life in the middle school when I decided to eat the new spicy wings with the super hot souce, I went to the hospital and I was very sick for a long time in the home.

And all of that because of the unhealthy food such as what our school used to have.

Do you know sir, I used to feel unacceptable in the school, just because the food, just because I can not eat like the rest of the students. and I can not enjoy the food with them.

I have never tried the school food since that day. the only case I could eat the school food is when the cafeteria have some kinds of soap, and some kind of the none spaicy food. And there is a lot of students have the same case of me, we all are sharing our healthy lunch together, you might before have seen us in the cafeteria while we are setting as a circle.

But by your decision, there are more than a hundred of student will turn back to eat in the school cafeteria.

We all will be enjoying the new cafeteria manu.

Especially because I heard that will be a different types of milk and different type chicken and also I heard from the new chef that you brought him from one of the biggest holtes in Virginia, he told me we will have a few types of salmon fish and others fish types.

In my opinion changing the school cafeteria manu was great idea to begin to keep your student health safe, especially your freshman and salphamore students.

I know what i'm telling you about the salphamore and the freshmens student very well, because I have my youngest brother his name is Generic_Name, he is addicted to the unhealthy food with the all of this food types, like the fast food. he could eat only the fast food in his life and he would be happy, but his body would not like that. Acctually his body begun to hurt him from now, because he been so fat and he could not move or do ant effort. he eats only the fast food which is the only unhealthy food in the world. he has a problems in his body, his body hurt him because he does not eat a vegetables and he does not has ant vetimans in his body, his body is fery big but is's very weak.and that is what the un healthy food does in our boodies. that is what you sir, saved us from and saved the next students from it. absotutly the healthy food a lot cheper than the unhealthy food. also one of the good thing is the teacher also would like to eat and try the new healthy food.

one of the good thing and actually it's the best thing ever is that healthy food will give the student more power than the un healthy food, and also the healthy food will make them paying more attention to the classes and to what the teachers are saying.

the new healthy food will be very good thing. I wish if you sir would took this decision 3 years ago, just whaen I was a freshman or when I was a salphamore that would be great if that happend. I can not stop Imagine if that happen I was going to be playing Gym all the summer and in the winter I'm was going to have PE class. That was going to be very good. I wish if that happend before.

But htat's fine I still can enjoy the rest of this year with eating a just healthy food from our cafeteria from this new chef. I heard he will add a new typers of food from other countries like France and Egypt and Spain, and Ethiopia also. yeah that is how the school lunch should be like.

Do you know Mr: principle that there are about 20 Muslim student in this school who does not eat the old manu food like the bacon and Pig.

Do you know Mr: Principal, in our school there are about 50 student or more than that who are vegan, this students used to feel very bad about the old school manu because they could ot eat any food from the cafeteria for all the time they had in the school. But from now and over these students are very happy about your decision. and also the Muslims students now they are happy because they can eat the vegan food and a least they can eat the chicken and the others food.

Actually I know there are a lot of student will arguement with you about your decision. but they still young to understand that, they still too young to look for thier health and the healthy food and the unhealthy food.

But, acctualy they will appreciate that very well when they became adults.

Mr: the principale thank you, thank you about looking for our health. thank you for being acceptable for the new ideas.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0
07CE77EA56C5,"Students work hard there is no arguing that. They have schoolwork, homework, extracurricular and maybe work, all these things make a students life stressful so it is important that they get a break every once in a while. I believe that students should get a long summer break, instead of a year-round school year, because, firstly, there are other activities that can be done during the summer that keep students minds active, secondly their health is at risk and lastly, summer break is beneficial to school staff as well.

From time to time, people need to get a break from their day-today life they need to take a moment to relax and enjoy their life and maybe discover an interest that they may have. Although school is important and necessary for success later on in life, so are outside experiences that can contribute to the development of a student's 'real life skills'. During summer break there are multiple activities that can be done in order to keep a student's mind active, whether it may be sports, summer camps, summer jobs etc. All these activities allow for their minds and bodies to stay active. Eventhough, they are not keeping their brains engaged in terms of school work and studying they are exposing themselves to new activities that might require them to think critically, open-mindedly and collaboratively; which I feel is essential for real life. For example, a student might be at summer camp and they are put in a group with four strangers and are given a challenging task that requires them to collaborate with the other member of the group, critically analyzing the situation and coming up with solutions and be open-minded to listening and trying to understand the perspectives of their peers. This also reflects their environment in school therefore, it can be said that they are keeping their minds active while outside of school.

Although, not all students might be involved in activities outside of school, some are taking a break from the stress of life itself. Due to all the demands in their life during the school year summer break is a good way to take a breather and take care of themselves mentally. Depression has been very common in teenagers in recent years, and although it may not be entirely due to the stress of school, school does contribute to the detirriation of their mental health. In addition, over-working ones self has negative impacts overall whether they are depressed or not. Too much stress in ones life can have negative effects on their health overall. High blood pressure, hypertension, severe weight loss are a few examples of the effects stress. Furthermore, when stressed our body releases a neurotransmitter called Cortisol, this neurotransmitter in excess can impair a persons thinking and reaction time; which is very important for students as they are required to think in order to complete school work and homework, therefore, if they dont take breaks their grades are probably going to drop due to their inability to think effectively, further contributing to their detirriating mental health.

Lastly, summer break is and essential time for everyone that is involved in schools, such as teachers, administrators, councilors etc. Although schools are intended to educate students, its the school staff that make this possible. This is why we need to give our school staff a break because all the points I stated above also applies to them. In addition, with a long summer break teachers are able to have more time to thoroughly think about their lesson plans for their students as well as have an extended amount of time to live their lives and enjoy time with their family and friends, after all, teachers are humans too and they need to be able to life their lives and forget that they are required to do so much for such little pay.

To emphasize further, I believe that schools should give students a long summer break instead of a year-round school year because a students mind will stay active during the summer through various activities that require students to think open-mindedly, critically and collaboratively. Also, students need a break in order to de-stress for the sake of their health mentally and physically. Lastly, a long summer break is needed for school staff as well because they also need to take a break, as well as the students. ",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.5,4.5
083E12F6B1D0,"Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it. words that The British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote. Do we choose our own character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control? My position is that we choose our own character traits. Why because Your character will be what you are and who you are.

Your charcter will be what you yourself choose to do. A reason is each person has there own way of being who they are. There is diferent types of characters that make each person unique in there own way. I also think that there is character formed by influence. there is alot of character that we can have. Many have very little and many have alot of character. example some people have a very sweet chacter in something they love or some people have a diffrent charcter trait that dont like to show it .

character traits is away to show your personality. When you go to a job interview the person that is taking your interview is looking at your characteristic is seeing how you are if you have a good charateristic or if you have a bad charcteristic. You are going to show your chacteristic by the way you inturduce yourself by the way you speak your body laguage. You are going to do what you feel conterble in doing. Many ask you to descibe yourself and by what you say they see if that is your charcteristic.

Character Traits are one of the ways that descibe how we are as a person. For example people describe me as a shy person that likes to help that is always offering to help. I also get descibed as a person that gets mad easily but does its best to not show it as much and pretents nothing has happeaned. Thats how some people descibe me. For me charcter traits is something that is you that makes you special in some way.

everywhere you go there is going to be someone seing your chacteristic. You make your own chacter, its something you do that describes who you are.

Depending in how you feel thats what you going to show which is your charcter trait it all depends in us we make our own character trait in the way we feel and act. its important to always show a good atitud for we can be described in a good way and try to have some good charcter trait for we can have a good reputation in life.

For example John Lubbock wrote ""your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.

Is very true we all make our own character and that makes us who we are and is something that makes you speical and the way you are.

Many people dont think that the charteristic is not as important they dont pay much attention to it because they maybe just like the looks but the charter has so much to say.

charcter is not only in humans its also in animals.

you describe a animal by its charcter by the way they act and take things. its very important to see the diffrents charateristic.

Many people when they go out with someone first they ask people what kind of personality that person they are going out with or wanting know. you can tell even by there looks and there body languge what kind of chacteristic they have because everyone makes there own charater.",2.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5

.My lesson will be about what they want to be when they grow up . and how will they make that become true? One reason that this is important is because students need to know what they want to be and what they want to do when they grow up so when they go to school every day they know what they are working hard for. For example when they go to school they are going to be thinking about why they are in school for and how can they make their dream become true. another example is that they are going to be ready because they all ready know what they want because every day they went to school and they ask them self what do i want for my family? ,what do i want for my life ? why am i doing this for ?. they will not forget why they are in school for because they will have a goal for school. Another lesson I will tell them is that they need to do do their best in school because when they grow up they will need it on a everyday life. A reason why they have have to try their best in school is because when you grow up you will need it for everything you will need math,reading, writing and more .One example is that when you go to pay a bill you will need to know how much you need and how did it add up to all that amount of money and you will know how to because you went to school and you tried your best everyday you went. Another example is that everywhere you go you will need to read. This is why elementary school students need to know what they want to be when they grow up and why is important to go to school. And is important that they have good friends that will keep them going and to cheer them up because they might feel lonely and is not really good for them and everyone needs a friend that will help you when you need it and do let bad friends make you do bad things and you know what is good and what is bad .If you tell elementary school students what they have to do when they are small they will be better people in the world. Because some people dont take it for real but maybe they will be better and take it more serous. This is why is important this lesson for everyone.",2.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5
0A324290AFE7,"I disagree with his statement, because if your good at something you can always put more effort in to it , and you can also be better at what you are good at, and last you can never stop growing of what you mastered . people in general they always get better of what they already mastered .

First, putting more effort can help you grow of what you are good at. For example, i'm good at singing at church. I will put more effort so i can become better at my pitch and the tone of my voice. Putting effort on something means you want to be better at it, and also means that you will like to learn more and grow. Putting more effort can get you somewhere. What i mean by that is a better situation, a better position. There is nothing bad putting a little effort on something that you can get better at and achieve.

Also , You can always be better. Being better is better then good, for example, I am good at cooking, but i can be better at cooking. You can be better then someone ; become better than that person that you want to challenge, or you can challenge yourself. Challenge yourself is a good way to grow. Perfect takes practice; be good of right now, but become better in the future. Taking your time and taking it slow, you can 100% be better. Trust me its not easy to be better that you have already mastered, but there's always way and a chance.

The important thing you need to know is you cant not stop growing; you can always keep on growing even though you are already good at it. Only because you are already good at something doesnt mean you stop growing, you can keep growing, if you try a little harder. I will always try my hardest to be the best at it; no matter how hard it is. There is always a way to keep on growing. If you show others that you can be way better even though you already good so far, they will see that there is a way to keep on growing. Show an example to others; let other people know that it is possible to be better, at something you are good at. Prove to those people that thinks you cant keep on growing of what you already mastered. You will not grow, if you dont put more effort in it, and time. If you just stop of what your good at, then you will not grow.

Remember you can always grow of what you mastered. Dont let anyone tell you that you cant. practice comes perfect. Do all the things you need to do to be better, then you will grow more then you expect. Its never to late to keep on growing.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0
0A8B8F282E45,"Winston Churchill once said ""success consists of going from failure to without loss of enthusiasm."" In other words, sometimes failure teach us how to get at the success. Many people agree with this statement, others disagree with it. It's easy to see both sides, but one stand out. Success is necessary consists of going from failure because failure teach us how to be better and create responsibility.

First, failure teach us how to be better, for example if I did a song to someone important to see and this person didn't like it; I won't give up even if is the worse song ever because the failure will show how to learn better and if you wont give up and always try the best you will get the success. As you can see you always have to do your best to get your success even if is the hardest thing. however, most of the famous had failure. it wasn't easy to get where they are; maybe can take long time to be like they are, but is hard. Most of the times is difficult to get the success that they have; they have that success because they never give up even if was the worse song or if they were failure.

Next, failure make you create responsibility, for example if you are a failure on something and want to be better, you always will try something new to get better and try your best, that's mean responsibility to yourself,

for example if I want to get my drive license and I fell many times, I can be a failure on it, but if I create responsibility and study every day I will do good and pass with success. If I speak another language and my

English is a failure I will be responsive and study to understand the people and do well on my classes. As you can see, always have a way, we learn with failure to be better then you were

On the another hand, some people believe we never have to have failure in our success, because failure can a negative in your life and in your life you always have to be have to be positive; this point make sense, but in life we always have to learn something. Therefore this statement is right because success consist of going from failure.

In conclusion, many people think that success don't consists of going from failure because it's a negative thing in our life, but success is necessary consist going from failure, because failure teach how to get the success in life, how to be better, and how to be more responsive in life.",3.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5

Nothing?, or run away to where you can make your own plans?. NO!. I strongly agree that, people should make decisions on their own.

Making decisions on your own can make you stronger. For example, when i realize i was failing my science class. I took a decision on my own by telling myself; i need to pass this class for the rest of the quarter. And i'm doing great now because i put in my mind with all my strength, focused and i'm doing more than amazing. If someone gave me that decision to pass that class, i wouldn't be able to, because i haven't made my mind up to that and maybe i don't or not into that class.

Secondly, you know your challenges to your decision that you make by yourself. For instance, i tried out this year for the school soccer team. I knew it was only 2 option: either you make it or you get cut out. So, me knowing that made me work harder when i get on the pitch. I get pains in my legs when i get home but i also know that, i have do it again tomorrow so it makes me do extra work home so that i won't be ill but be in shape for the next day.

Lastly, sometimes we make a bad decision which help us learn. To prove this, 3 weeks ago, my mom ask me to clean her bathroom for her, also i had a club to attend. Because i knew going to club will be fun and meeting new friends so, i told my mom i'm going to the club instead, and i will clean the bathroom the next day. And so, i went to the party. A friend of mine was a drug dealer: i didn't know, and he was wanted my the police. He came to the same party and we were sharing the same table. We were drinking, chatting, eating and having fun. All of a sudden, we saw 3 police men that came to arrest my friend but because we were sitting together; we were all arrested because him. If i choose to clean the bathroom this would have not happen to me. The lesson that i learned is that; i don't need to follow my decision every time, and also know who hang around with.

As a results, making decisions on our own can make us strong and focused, know our challenges and also learn.

0BB9FAE6E27B,"Setting A Good Example

Have you thought of set an example for your own behavior?

Albert Schweitzer said ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" Setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence other people.

However; others believe that their are better ways to influence others because the person being influenced should set their own examples not everyone wants to follow someone examples.

Although not everyone thinks the same it's better to set an example by your own behavior to influence others. People get influenced by demonstrations, peoples mistakes and when visualizing things.

To influence someone you have to set an example for them to visualize what you are trying to influence them to do. Most people get influence when presented demonstrations through videos, presentations and pictures. My favorite youtubers influence me by spreading postivity through their videos and content. They help the homeless by providing them shelter; they make people's day by helping them with their needs. They influence me to want to help the homeless and other people. These youtubers Influence their subscribers to spread posivity throughout the world by the examples they set on their videos.

A lot of people learn from others mistakes; setting a good example from your own behavior will influence others not to do your mistake in your example because they will take it into concerdation. One of my friends told me their experience on missing their opportunity of taking a course required for graduation. She did not get to graduate on time she stayed one more year in high school to complete the course she missed. She regretted not taking the course her junior year to graduate on time. My friend influenced me to take the class my junior year and to learn from her mistakes. I didn't miss my opportunity I got to take the course and earned the credit for it. I learned from her example she influenced me by telling me to follow her example to accomplish it.

Most people don't believe things until they see an example of things. They're are people that need to visualize things to get influenced by them. It's confirmed that most influencers present things that you can visualize to influence people. I am a person that needs to see an example of something in order to believe it. When I am searching information I need to see if it is fiction or non fiction. Once I researched up the wrong information for a presentation the article didn't state a true event. I got a bad grade for the presentation as my consequence I had an F that quarter for not stating a true fact. Influencers set example's of their own behavior to influence you the right way.

Others believe that there are better ways to influence others by letting the person being influenced set their own example. The person being influenced can not set their own examples if they don't have experience. People need to follow someone example because they need to be influenced before they can influence others by setting their own examples. All influencers have been influenced by others examples they didn't set their own example.

Following an influencers example will help the person being influenced learn from their mistakes and improve from them to set better examples to others being influenced.

Albert schweitzer set his own examples from his own behavior to influence others. He was

Inspired by other influencers examples and that it was the only thing to help influence others.

He says that the best way to influence other people is to set a good example by your own behavior. You should follow someone examples by their own behavior to set a good example to influence others.

I'd like to say that I, Generic_Name, have had first impression on classmates, teachers, and strangers. They usually end up being wrong about that person, and end up being a totally different person than expected.

First impressions are 80 percent always judgmental. They judge the person by what they wear, by what they look like, and by the way they act. I for example was non for being a trouble maker in middle school and when I started my freshman year of high school, I was non as a quiet kid for a while. Reason being is because i was too nerves sent it was my first year in a much bigger school. After a while, my classmates started to get to know me a bit more and realized how much of a troublemaker I was.

Whenever I saw a new need student in the schools that i have gone to, I would always assume by the way they dressed, looked and acted. This year there was a girl, lets call her Generic_Name. Generic_Name would wear hunting clothing, had glasses and looked funny.

One day I made fun of her and she went off on me. She told me her life story and I felt bad and apologized for what I said. Now I look back to this story and remind myself to try my best to not assume too much about a best.

You don't have control on your own character trait because you let others influence you to think that's what your character trait is. Many people let others pick what their character trait is instead of doing it on your own and learning who you are and who you want to be and/or let others decide what their character trait is or are obligated to be this this person their not. Most let others decide because they don't know who they want to be or what others want them to be.

I agree with this prompt because you are obligated to because the other person is in control of your life, you let others choose because you aren't sure who you want to be, and you choose what you want your character trait to be.

You are obligated to because the other person is in control of your life and will make you feel vulnerable if you don't do as they say; they are the ones in power with what your character trait is and who you are going to be. An example can be your parents especially your mom that raises you. It might not be all mothers out there but most of them will raise a child and tell them what their character trait is going to be. Another example can be is if you are in a situation and it's between your life or death and the person makes you choose what your character trait is when that is not who you want to be but your life is on the line. Whoever you choose to be reflects who and what you are going to be in the future.

You let others choose what your character trait is because you are not sure what your character trait is and don't know who you want to be.

Many people tell each other that this is who they are and just influences people to tell you that's who you are. How will you know that for sure though if you cannot even figure out what your character trait is on your own and if that is what you choose it to be. This is where you over think about your character trait and just take your friends or any other person's opinion about who you are and what your trait is. If you are not sure who and what your character trait is just learn more about yourself and don't take anyone else's opinion and make that your character trait.

You choose what you want your character trait to be because you have the power to control who and what you want to be and not what other's have to say what your character trait is. You yourself choose to make what your character will be.

The best thing that a person can do to figure out who and what they want to be and what their trait is going to be is listing what you like about yourself by doing pros and cons. You will know your character trait when you feel comfortable and you love yourself for making another person smile and making their day. Along the way you will learn new things you did not know about yourself. We get to choose our own character traits not others, let that be a valuable lesson.

In conclusion you yourself choose what your character traits are going to be and not by others because you have the power to choose who you are and what your character traits is going to be.",2.5,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5
0D382343F3D7,"Why do curfews interfere with young people's lives? For some people, they have to stay at work really late because of this reason. A curfew could really mess up someones life when they're doing something important. No wonder why curfews interfere with young people's lives and here's the reason. Curfews interfere with young people's lives because they have to stay at work very late, have to intended to something , and have fun with their friends.

However, some people don't agree with this position. They think that a curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble. For example, When the teenager comes home on time, their mother wouldn't be scared where they have gone and why they stay out late. So, this explains why the council thinks that a curfew to young people's lives could get them out of trouble. However, young people still consider that having a curfew could interfere with their lives and here's the first reason.

Going home on time when they're at work is impossible. For example, some people working at a restaurant stay late some times because of cleaning the dirty dishes or taking a long time to do their side jobs. Also, when they're working for the government, they have to stay really late because of paper work or something urgent. This shows that having a curfew could make young people really stressed because they would have to rush their side jobs and get home in time. That is one good reason why they shouldn't adopt the curfew and here's the next one.

A lot of young people have things to do when they're out . For example, when the teenagers are in a play, they can't stop the play until it's finished or they will ruin the play. When they're at a school dance,they can't leave if they're participating the dance or they have a date. Young people sometimes have things to do after hours or want to go and participate. That's another good reason why the council shouldn't adopted the curfew and here's the last reason.

For teenagers, they just want to have fun and stay out late. For example, teenagers like to drive out very late with their friends or drink with them. Also, play games with their friends and stay up until they finish a level or a quest at a arcade or Dave and Busters. A lot of teenagers don't always sleep on time when they're having fun. That sums everything and here's the closing.

In conclusion, this stats that curfews interfere young people's lives because of them working very late. Also, when, they're intending in an event. Lastly, when they're having fun with their friends. This shows that curfews interfere with young people's lives. They can stay out as long as they like, it's their life.",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0

Is the pride for us school have a good future for us. When you do all things by yourself is an pride, for yourself. Graduate from school is something greatest accomplisment anybody can do it for yourself this is an pride, that everybody want to have. If we don't never to try something never going to know about the things, that way we need to try to do anything.

Greatest accomplisment can be a little thing but, if you do by yourself is a pride for you it does't matter, what type of thing it is. Family always are going to be pride of it. Opportunities for to do things always can have to yourself.

Greatest Accomplishment mean that you can do it like going to university for a better life is something greatest accomplisment that can do.

0E07647BBC59,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home ?

Well school is a place your suppose to feel comfortable in, there are many different schools. I personally think being home schooled can have it's advantages and disadvantage, you of course have benefits for example not being bothered by other classmates, and finishing your work on time without having a distraction, kids in outiside schools have that disadvantage of having classmates who don't care about there education and some kids get carried away and distracted and they end up having to repeat classes or stay another extra year, It's very different because years on years you can just retake the class at home with nobody judging you about failing, here it is like an embarassment to be seen another year so that's something to look into.

Home schooled kids i would say get more attention as in that one on one attention, I would also say outside schools get the same but there are plenty of full classes and the teacher can't always get around to all students. There are lots of kids who want to be able to attend outside school but they can't for many reasons for example a disability or how they are a celebrity, being in that situation you would want to not be known like that so your just forced and obligated to attend home school and that's when home school kids would think it would be better to be attending outside school you'll always be home and feel trapped you'll get tired of being in your own home, It does people good being able to socialize a bit.

School can also be finished faster during home school, lots of things are offered, but also lots of things are not offered for example lunch, in almost all public schools there is free lunch, free everything your getting a free education, home school is expensive and you will always provide your own food. The wifi at home will also be payed, the computer and just many things but as we know it can be beneficial in life your getting an education so it's worth the spend you'll get something out of it.

What's better than being home and getting an eduacation it's benefitting you and it will in the future, when you get a dipoma. My point is either your in public school, private school, home school, it will benefit you in many many ways. ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0

Laws; the consumption of drugs and alcohol, to carry of guns, and to drive; the consumption of drugs is unlawful in too many states and you need a permission that you can buy it and the alcohol is legal but you need to be 21 years old or more to buy it, to carry of guns; is legal but is same to drugs and alcohol you need a permission to buy one and be older, and to drive to get a license need to be 16 or older that its up to you, but if you decided to get your license when you are 16 years old, you have to drive with someone also as copilot; the copilot need be more older than you, you need to do this because they want be sure you have the experience to drive alone.

1087B6C7FB98,"I say its a good idea that the school menu should change to being more healthier because a lot of students eat junkfood mostly everyday, need to eat more fruits and vegetables, and wanting a healthy live.

As you know, students eat junkfood food anywhere they go to such as movie theaters, gas stations, and restaurants. Some places do serve healthy foods and snacks but people rather choose junkfood because they're not use to eating good. Most stores put the unhealthy foods in the front, so kids can go straight into putting it in their carts or baskets. However, we can't manage telling people if they want to eat healthy or not.

Every school want kids to get a fruit or a vegetable at lunch. Some kids chose not to get a fruit or vegetable because they dont care about eating it or they it just throw away. Eating veggies will help you with your body like for an example; a carrot will help with your eyes. If kids dont want to get any of their fruits or veggies they could give it to a friend that will love to eat it instead of wasting it.

Eating healthy will not cause you to have much problems but, eating unhealthy will cause much problems. I think parents should focus on what their kids are eating for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. If you dont like eating unhealthy you could always pack lunch. Although, you could eat junkfood once or twice a week and not everyday.

I personality agree to having the school changing the school menu because the world has change and we want to eat more fruit and veggies, having our lives healthy, and wanting kids to stop eating junk food all the time. It has been an issue for the past years and I think its time for schools to have different types of food. Not everyone wants to eat healthy food we could sometime have some unhealthy at lunch.

Famous people like their fans sometimes they are under 12 ages. if the persons did not given to the new generation good example they can not be influencing good things in them.

The parents they are the best example for their sons, and daughter at home. Because at home sometimes is the first school for our child that can has, there we learn speak, walk, and who clothing you. Example: if her father is a drunk, and smoker what is a example him given to his sons. That would by influencing in her sons and can destroy the future of them. This situation happen in many family and children start to have problem with the authority. And is the bad example that their parents given to them . And is no only the things the parents give to her sons nevertheless they need more then a example, more then things like expensive clothes. and shoe many of them they need a parents that care of them.

The teacher after the father they are so important to give a example of respect, how can be responsible with our homework they challenge us , with no matter the obstacle is front of us we can do it many of the teacher support you in the situation of the school but they teach us who can we do our work when be adults and they start to explain many thinks that you dont know example: if you do something wrong they help us to find a situation like i math and they do not say bad thinks when you do something wrong because they respect you but we like a students need to do it too. And with this attitude is like a teacher can influencing in a student with the respect.

Leader is person that is caretaker of a group of people it is in the school, in a church in many places we can find one. This one example of who can be influences of a movement like in the church that person need to be example of his people than the people follow him or she.

Student to graduate early instead of waiting the four year to graduate. Graduating a year earlier would be a great thing for student to do because there are people who are trying to manage work and school but it's difficult for some people because they can't do both, If they work and they come late after work and the next morning they wake up tired from work that they are tired to go to school and it makes it difficult to go to work and then go to school.

A reason why I feel students should graduate early is because if they graduate early they can go to college, and if college allows them to choose their hours they can decide on what time they can go to college or the days.

It could also depend on what you want to do career wise.

If they allow that you can work and go to college and it would make it easier for you and you won't feel tired after college to go to work.

For example,My mom graduated early and she was able to work and and go to college as well.

Another reason is that if you go to high school and work its difficult because you have to worry about school and work, sometimes thats a problem because when you come late from work and in the morning when you have to go into school your tired and you dont wanna go to school and your tired and you can't concentrate in school but I feel like when your in college you can choose your time and date and it makes it easier for you.

For Example, I have a friend who works and goes to school to and he tells me its difficult for him to manage school and work and sometimes hes even tired to go to school. Even when hes at school hes tired and can't do any of his work because hes tired and its hard for him to concentrate.

The last reason is if people were to graduate a year earlier from high school. They can also go to college and depending on on what they want in their career, they could also graduate college early and start you career early

For Example, My Uncle graduated High school earlier and he also graduated college which made it easier for him to start his own business and it really helped him out in life and hes really happy because he graduated early.

If you choose to graduate and do classes in the summer you would feel accomplished and you would feel relief you wont have to be there for 4 years and only 3 years.

If you finish early you can have time for work and college and also you get start your career early and you would feel happy with what you have accomplished. ",2.5,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5

Also is depend if the student want to, but for me it's a good choice, the student have to take summer school, be honest it's not a lot of work.

Many students saying that is preferable take the four years because we are young and we have time to think what we wanna do, but not, is logical that the student that wanna graduate early have more time than the student that wanna take for years in the school.

Many students wanna graduate early but their parents saying no, so they can't graduate early because their parents saying that is a bad choice and a lot of things more, each person think different but for me is a really good choice.

For me is a good opportunity because i can think in what i wanna do with my life, because basically i have one more year, but something that happens with the students that graduate early is that they take a brake in that year and when they going to begin the collage they feel tired and they don't wanna go to collage because they feel tired and that is not a reason for not go.

Why not graduate early, if it is a good idea, it can feel free and it can thinking about collage without pressure.

If i wanna graduate early obviously i have to work a little be more, but i will have the chance to have one more year and in that year i can work in something good and productive for my school life. If a student gonna graduate early and in that year do nothing, he will lost his time and that's bad.

12E3D52345C6,"Technology has always acted as a compelling and mysterious field for me. Even as a child, I spent countless hours not playing my video-game consoles as intended, but rather meticulously studying every component of the device in an attempt to crack the mystery on how it operated. Despite the fact that I've grown older and many aspects of my life have changed, my passion for technology has not only remained, but undoubtedly grown stronger as well. Therefore, an internship in this field seems vital in feeding and nurturing this passion. Although I have not had previous experience in shadowing, an opportunity to shadow would be fitting due to my previous experience and ever-growing passion in this field.

My experience in the technological field proves fitting for this opportunity to shadow. In school, I am enrolled in the Center for Information Technology at Generic_School. This specialty center provides me with crucial access to exclusive technology-based courses and teachers that help me broaden my vision in the technology field. Classes such as IT Project Management, Programming, and AP Computer Science Principles are all courses that I have been graciously provided with through the center and received exceptional results in. This daily involvement in technology not only increased my knowledge in this field, but also my curiosity on the subject. Outside of school, I am a member of the Technology Student Association, a club dedicated to assisting students nurture their interests through rigorous competitions. Through this club I have been able to surround myself with peers with similar interests and aspirations. This club has also provided me with opportunities to exhibit my knowledge in the technological field through competitions, receiving first place in States in Mass Production, Junior Solar Sprint, and Biotechnology. My involvement and superior results in these events prove to show not only my interest in this field, but my capabilities as well. These experiences transfer directly over to the internship, allowing for a smooth transition without much confusion.

The passion I have for technology undeniably proves me to be fitting for this internship opportunity. A crucial action that proves my strong interest in technology occurred when high school specialty center results were published. I was accepted into the medical, IB, and the information technology centers. Despite the fact that the majority of my close friends chose to enroll into the medical center, I stuck with my passion and enrolled into the Information Technology center. The action of choosing my interest over my close friends of many years displays how much I value technology and wish to pursue it in the future. In addition, my strong passion for technology can be displayed through the utilization of my free time. While other kids may choose to spend this time by indulging themselves into video games, much of my time is spent educating myself on technology. Many enjoyable hours of activities such as reading on the history of computers or watching videos on the future of technology were spent during this time. This use of my limited free time shows that technology, in my mind, is not a merely a class in school, but rather a hobby or an enjoyable subject. This attitude would no doubt have a beneficial effect for the internship.

In conclusion, the heavy interest and years of experience I have in technology proves me to be exceptional candidate for this shadowing opportunity. Although my work experience is limited, my passion and expierence in technology may help me ease into the internship without trouble. The talent I have in technology mixed with the catalyst that is my preexisting passion for this field helps me understand the importance of this internship. Not only will this internship assist in broadening my horizons on technology, but it will also help nurture and grow this passion into something meaningful and of use to the real world. Therefore, I believe this internship is perfect for me.                ",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.5,5.0
13450D581EC9,"I am agree with the Waldo Emerson's prompt. He wrote that "" to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.""

""Never give up."" This word conveys our intensify about our thought. It makes us courageous. Life is not a bed of rose, life is struggle. Every single person has their life struggle. Nobody is a perfect at they look. A perfect man is he who win the struggle. A successful man, he not get success in a second. He had lot of struggle in his life,but he don't stop for his goal. After long time keep trying made him successful. He adjust the struggle and keep go through the struggle and win the struggle which is make him success.

For example a soccer player has his goal to make a score so that they can win. But for making a goal he has to cross the against team then he will success to make a goal.

You failed !. You are done your life today. We couldn't expect from you this. You fool !. You looser. Now you go home and get sleep that's all you can do. Should I listen them and do what they want or give up my life? NO!.I am failed, i am looser but it dosen't mean that i can't win anymore. Don't lose hope. You have hand,you have brain,you have leg use those one day win come to you then you can show them that you did. you made it.

For example,you are not good in Math but it's dosen't mean that you are bad in Social Science. Show your talent. You can't able to solving the Math equation but you have talent to make Social Science rules.

Time is valuable more than everything. A good minded people use their proper time. If you use time and you failed in your success then don't lose hope,don't stop, don't blame on time and yourself. Time can give you more opportunity to use it and make yourself successful. You just have to keep try. But if you being lazy you just waste your time and you got looser reward from the time. Always remember that time never gonna come back.

For example, If you don't do your homework the teacher not gonna give you a grade. You gonna fail in this subject. You just waste your time. But if you do the homework but is incorrect. The teacher can give you one more time to fix the correction though its incorrect.

An Inspiration can make your goal. If you look or read about successful person how they became successful in their life you also can inspire to do what they did. An inspiration can bring you encourage. Make you sense what you want to do and what should you do for your future. There are different people has their different choices. From the successful people you can organize your life.

For example, there was a story about Robert Bruce and a Spider. One day Robert Bruce was laying in the cave and saw a spider was trying to climb the wall but its failed seven times to reach the wall of top. After seven times keep trying makes its successful. The spider reached the top of the wall. This event make Robert Bruce inspire himself.

Everything has their opposition. If you wanna be a good man you have to know what is bad things. The same way if you want to win you have to know what is lose. Fail is common afire in human being. If you don't fail it's mean you dosen't even try. Fail is a part of our life. But don't get depressed yourself by depression. You fail but you have more option to start it from the beginning again. Before you stop try just think should i try one more time. Maybe this time you can become a winner. Just one more think can bring your success.

For example, You digging a soil for the gold. You dig almost come to the gold but this time you give up and stop digging the soil. If he dig the soil one more time he can see the gold which one he want. So always think one more time before you quick.

They have to confront the problem without losing they enthusiasm. In other example, confront your failure make you more strong and think about what is good and what is bad.

When you confront your failure you have to be conscious for what you doing. For example, you can't repent because you do what you do for a reason. In other word, people don't never have to give up they have to fight and have always the enthusiasm to be what are they are. Although, when you failure make you think more straight and clearly. That teach you to be a strong and continue struggle with your life. In fact, I always have my enthusiasm up even if I failure because that make me more comfortable to who I am and don't be scare to confront my problem. There are many people that scare loss they enthusiasm just because they failure. Failure don't make make a you a bad person, It make you to understand that in the life have down and up emotion. However, we choice ""what we want to be and we do what we want to do""

Therefore, Winston Churchill want to people be happy. He want to people understand that they don't have to loss they enthusiasm don't matter what. On the other hand, I agree with him because if you have the enthusiasm you can handle your problem and be able to solved it. In my opinion, Winston Churchill have throughout for many things and he want to other people be strongly and never give up like him. People have to consider that not always will be easy to don't have any problem or other thing that make you to do thing that you don't want to do, but you always have to be with the enthusiasm to confidence. Despite, it hard to always have the enthusiasm to confront your failure, but you have to be strong and continue for what you have been done.

The enthusiasm help you to reflect your ideas and make you to do the things that you scare to do. Make the success strong with you enthusiasm.

In conclusion, never loss your enthusiasm because that help you to be strong. Confront your failure with all your enthusiasm you have to demonstrated that you are more strong than your problems. There are many ways to be success with your own personality you can focus on what you propose, being strongly and confront your failure.

16DEF72E220A,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But I don't think that it would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because, there are many reasons that the students could not able to learn home by yourself in online; which are that some problems, and communicating. Also there are more position to I disagree and agree with this argument.

Firstable, I think the students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, it would not benefit for the studehts, because of the students could have some question that they don't know. And if someone who dont' teach with them, they cannot learn that more understable. And they migth cannot catch up their late works, because of they don't help anybody. I have an examples of that the girl who has taken an online classes, and she didn't go to the school, because she thought, the online class is better than to learn subjects and it doesn't have to do that everyday and she can study her subject whenever day she could. But she have to her exam in the school, and she didn't study as well as can't catch up her study work. Now she stopped to take an online class in the home and go to school. So, in my opinion, even thought the online class is giving you as more free time but if you can't study by yourself, It couldn't help you that learn.

Also, the students can't communicate with other students. It means that the student can't study with other students that they can't make some friends and could not be an active just like some other students. Also, it will be impact their behaviour that they'll be more lonely. Because the students behaivior is always changing and easy to get used to their environment, especially the high school students. Therefore, i disagree to attend classes from home by way of the online and video conferencing benefit for the students.

On the other hand, the online class is not really useless thing that for the students. Of course, It should be has some advantegious way to attend online and video class, which are it helps that the students could be more mature and more focusing on their work. And they have more free time because the student doesn't have to this everyday as a school, they can do that whatever time to working on it. So, we don't have to hold one point of view, we should try that two other sides. For examples, the every students are different way to study, we don't have to demand to do only one way,

they might be more interest with the online, video class and the other students could be more enjoy to attend this class. Consequently, every students who enjoy that much, they could take that class much easily to study in their home.

In conclusion, I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, but not all of students, because they all have a different way to study and somehow the student will need some help to support their what they are studying. In that case, students might be trying to give up to study alone. Therefore, the student might think very well to thier option to to attend classes from the home.         ",3.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,3.0

If we doing something everyday we could accomplish something like if you exercise every day with healthy meals you will be losing weight and burning calories, if we do not do nothing and don't take care of your self you'll gain weight, see stretch marks on your body or even get diagnosed by diabetes or even something even more serious like a stroke, heart attack, and organ failure.

Everyday people accomplish things for example: work people who work in construction have to work through some harsh conditions when its freezing or when its flaming hot. From my experience of working in construction I was a laborer working for ten hours, I as a laborer had to make sediment, mix for placing cinder blocks, carry buckets of water, cinder blocks, fill in the the holes with concrete, had no breaks only lunch, set up scaffolds and lift long heavy wooden planks and climb up and set the pallets of cinder blocks and water for the mix so it doesn't dry.

A Japanese manga artist named Akira Toriyama, the creator of Dragon Ball and Dr. Slump, even though both stories are fantastic but the one who stuck out the most is Dragon Ball. a young Akira saw a manga tournament who had the best manga it took him a couple tries to win and that lucky day he saw a editor from Toei Animations and told Akira great job from there he got confident and inspired that he could make something happen. later on he kept making mangas until he made one called dragon boy and one other manga and he combine both them and created dragon ball, he created Goku the main character and gave him the personality of Akira. Akria sold more than nine million copies of dragon ball from that money he made a studio call Bird Studio for his animations. Once Dragon Ball got so popular in Japan Toei Animations bought the anime from Akria and made the next Dragon Ball series called Dragon Ball Z. Dragon Ball has been around 32 years since it released in the U.S. and it still going and getting more popular. This year in January 14 the new Dragon Ball Super Broly came out in the U.S. and made one hundred million in the box office, one of the most famous anime and one of the best selling anime movies of all time.

18FDAA0BF6A2,"Do you think students in high school, should commit a career at a young age? I think students should wait until there last year or second to last year of high school, to think about getting a career. Students in high school should focus more on school rather than a career. But they can think about what they wanna do after high school.

Do you think by the time students enter high school, They are expected to identify a career? I think that students who are about to enter high school. Should focus on school and than getting out of high school. High school is not a joke it matters. You have to pass your classes in order to go to the next grade. If you fail some classes you repeat those classes again the next year or have to go to summer school. You dont wanna go to summer school. I wouldn't wanna have to go to summer school just because I didn't pass the first time.

When kids enter high school, should they think about a career? I think they should take electives that relate to a career. like fun electives they can take during the school year. I think that high school is getting us prepared for the real world kinda. Because once we leave high school we are on our own. Noone is gonna help you besides your family and friends. That's why I suggest getting a job so you can take care of yourself.

I think students thinking about a career, before going to high school. Should focus on school because high school isn't a joke. Of Course high school has drama but we have to deal with and it's not that hard. I think kids could brain storm about getting a career at a young age. High school isn't easy we all have our problems we have to deal with. But high school is temporary just like pain is temporary when your dealing with depression. High school in general sucks sometimes because of the drama and high school girls. The teachers aren't like middle school and elementary school teachers.

1B2274161889,"I personally think that working alone is very beneficial. When I work alone I can work on my own time. I do not have to listen to anyone, I am my own boss in this situation. Also I have nothing to go over once I am done because I know I did it all myself and it was done right. Independently I can do more work. whenever I work in groups I get side tracked way more then I usually do.

Working alone has become a very common thing for me. I have always preferred to work alone. Working alone lets me work on my own pace. I can work whenever I want too. I have tried to work in groups but they always want to do the last minute type of thing, but when I work alone I do that sometimes too. but i know I got to do it all. I also don't like to keep someone if they did their part. One time I was doing a group power point and two out of four of my partners did not do their part and I ended up failing because of them.

When I work in groups I feel like I am doing all the work and my group members are just messing around and not helping me. I have had very bad experiences with groups I have failed many projects, class activates, and labs just because I would trust people on doing the work that they would get when we distributed it. Last week in oceanography my table was doing a lab and I had to do all the work because my whole table group wanted to talk to a whole different table group and not help me. My teacher would not let me work alone even after I told him about the situation. Later I told my guidance counselor and he did not do anything about it either.

Every time I have worked in a group I have been side tracked. I can never do anything with someone because i always have the urge to just talk to them and not get any work done. I have noticed this bad habit of mine for a long time now I have tried to fix it but i just can not. Working alone is a very good thin for me i am very productive when I work alone.

1B622A28EDD9,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home than at school? I believe taking classes online at home could be very benificial, because you wouldn't have to worry about getting distracted by other students like you would at school. You'd be able to advance at your own pace, meaning you won't have to rush at everything. Lastly, you wouldn't have to be so stressed from all the homework you get from each teacher in each class, but everything has its disadvantages as well.

I'd like to start by saying that not being distracted from your class is great, most students get easily distracted by others. Anything that makes you lose your focus during class is considered a distraction, which includes even cellphones. If you don't pay attention to class your most likely going to end up getting lost and fail, but when your at home doing your work online by yourself you wouldn't have to worry about this.

Another benefit from being able to attend class at home, would by that you can move at your own pace. This is a big benefit, for example at school I have to follow the teachers pace and sometimes when the teacher moves to fast on a subject I end up confused and lost making me fail the test or not doing good on the homework. At home you could take your time to process and understand the subject before moving on to a different one. Helping you do a lot better.

My final reason would be less stress. I say this because I'm stressing right now to keep up my good grades. I get to much homework and most of the times I don't get time to do it because of work or family. I'm the oldest at home and I have to take care of my siblings, which means having to make food for them, clean up the house making sure everyones ok. Making me not do homwork after school. Most of the times I have to stay up late doing homework. I wouldnt have to worry about this if I did everything online making me less stressed.

I have given you three reasons on how doing your classes online can be benificial, but there are also some disadvantages. One of them could be not interacting with other students. I know that earlier I had said others can become a distraction but thats during class after class it's nice talking to others, everything has its time and place. Another disadvantage could be that you may need help with something and you won't be able to have someone to help. At school we have our teachers and when your stuck with something they can help you by explaining it in other words to make it sound more simple. So, there our benefits on having class online but also disavantages.

I end this essay by saying that I still believe taking online classes at home can benefit you a lot, But everyone has there own way of learning. If your more of a independant person than I would recommend taking online classes but if your more of a social person than stay in school. All that matters is that you pass your class.",4.0,3.5,4.5,4.0,3.5,3.5

Me agrada demasiado aprender cosas nuevas y nuevos lugares solo hay una cosa que me enoja y es que apesar de no ser una persona indocumentada y pues nosotros los puertorriquenos somo parte de estados unidos y solo por el hecho de que nuestro primer idioma sea en espanol muchas personas nos tratan como indocumentados.

llevo 2 anos los cuales no an sido nada facil ya que la escuela a sido uno de mis mayores obstaculos pues es bastante complicado entrar a un salon y sentir que estas completamente solo.

I truly believe after school homework clubs are beneficial because students can study, get homework done faster, and socialize.

First off, I believe after school homework clubs are positive because students can study. Students can study what they need to if they have a little extra time at school. Many students dont have enough time to study at home and a after school club could give them more time to study what they need to. Some students need extra help understanding what is on the paper and studying could help them a lot.

Next, after school homework clubs are important because students can finish homework faster. Some students cant get homework done at home so an after school club could help them. Students can get extra help with what they dont understand at an after school club. Many students cant students can get their homework done faster by the help of other students.

Additionally, after school homework clubs are useful because students can socialize. Students can learn how to talk better to other students. Students can talk to friends when their done with their work. Many students cant talk to their friends on the other teams so after school club could fix that.

I think that it would be a good idea change the lunch menu to be more healthy because it will help the students to consume less unhealthy food, can help students to stay healthy and could encourage the students to begin eat healthier.

Students consume unhealthy food on school alsmost every day, change the menu into a healthier will help students to consume less unhealthy food. Eating unhealthy food daily could damage students in many differents ways. One this ways is that could bring students diseases such as heart problems or could cause obesity in a young age. Additionally change the menu could not just be benefical for students it could also help teachers and personal staff as well to consume less unhealthy food daily.

By having a healthier menu could help the students to stay healthier because they will be eating the proteins that they needed to develped better. Also this could help students to do better in things such as sports, and their respectives classes on school. Another advantage of this menu is that will give students the opportunity to try something new instead of having the same food that they're had been having year over year. In addition by doing this could migth make students realize that having this menu is not just to force them to eat food that they don't like, instead is to keep and them stay healthy.

Even thougth that some of the students will migth think that this would be a bad idea because will eliminate some of their favorite food, I think it will be helpful for them because by doing this will encourage them to begin to eat healthier, because that could help them now and on the future. Also this could encourage them to covince their friends and family to begin to eat healty because this could prevent them from having a disease just for eating unhealthy food.

In conclusion I think that change the school menu into a new healthier lunch menu is a good idea, because it will help the students to consume less unhealthy food, could help them to stay healthy and could encourage them begin to eat healthier.

1EEA95D39409,"In some societies student are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. ALlthoug, some peoplesay it's bad idea because the student doesn't care any more about his school. Overall,some peoplesay it's good idea to student work in this time because you can save money from know until you be a man.

First,some peolple say it's bad idea. For example,the student when he see the money he will not care any more about school and his grade will go down and maybe he will repeted the year again. Student is bad to work beacause if he have friend they doesn't work and the guy who work see his friend not working and he just work they will have a big problem. However, is bad idea to student work know becausehe will not care any more about his high school.

Second,some people think is good idea to student in high school to work know. For example,when the student work from know and he save money he will come a man to go to colloge he will have a good money to go to the college,For example,student or other gay work's from they younger they can save a good money and when get like a man to get married they can look up the money and get it fast they can buy a house very fast and he doesn't get worried about the money. In adition,is good idea because the student can grow up and he will have a good money.

In conclusion, In some societies,student are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. I think is good idea for me but is not a bad idea is good idea beacuse I can save money know and when I beacame a big man and my friend there reach and they want to travel to Generic_City I will say yes I can ,but is bad idea because if myfriend ask me and I don't have money I am can say no.

In societies, some people say to be a younger guy is good to work. Altough some people say is not a ggod idea to work because your can be tired. Overall,some people say it's nice idea to work because you can help your family.

First,some people say is bad idea beacause you will get tired. For example, if you work after school like from 4pm to 12am you will get tired and you leave far away you will have to sleep from 1am to 7am. Then you will have to wake up around 7am and go to school so your not can get to much of sleeping. For example,the work made you tired from 2 week if you was never work at any thing before and if you think you a big guy and you work like at rasturant and you a bad manager maybe he will talk to you in bad away maybe you willfight him. Inadition,is bad to work because you will get tired and youmaybe you will get an a fight with some one and you go to jail.

Second, some people say it's good idea to work because you can help your family.

Altough,like when you work and get like one thousand dollar from the work you give your dad a good money and he can pay and when you see your dad happy and your gud is happy from you will life all life in a good way. Aresult,I think is good idea because I do samething I work after school from 4pm to 1am so that mean I work for 9 houers and I work every Monday,Wensday,Friday,Starday and

Suday,so I make every 2 weeks one thousand dollar I gave all ma money to my dad. When I see my dad is happy from me I feel so happy because I know that my gud happy from me,my dad open for me account in wells fargo and untill know I am saving money and I have 1 thousand dollar.

1F28812EE23D,"This assay is going to be about a thing that some businesses are doing which is to make a four day work week adding two hours to the regular work days. This essay will have my opinion if we should implement this idea in my school or not. I will talk about some advantages and disadvantages about the implement of this idea to my school. I will suggest some action that a shool should take before the implementing of this idea of this idea.

Imagine that you recieve a letter from your school saying that they are planning implement and idea which is to make students come to school four days instead of five adding two hours to the normal day of school. I disagree with this idea because it will affect my school which is a high school, instead of helping it. The first thing that will be affected will be the after school program and activities. If my school add two hours to our schedule each day will consist in ten hours, so students will be more tired and less student will be interest in involving in after school programs so the school might cancel them. I would said that it will affect a high school especially because there are a lot of juniors and siniors that work after school and it can cause to most of them to quit their jobs.

Implementing this idea to our school have some advantages and disadvantages as well. One advantage of adding two hours to our schedule are that we will have more time to do our work in school because classes should be longer. Another advantage is that this idea help to conserve energy and resources of the school. A disadvantage is that after school programs might be closed because not so many people will be interested in that. The other disadvantage is that some students might have to change their jobs hour which is not easy and some of them would have to opt for quiting their jobs.

Before adding this idea to my school or any school they should ake some actions before. First the school staff should make a meeting to discuss the idea. Then they should make another meeting but this time including the parents of the students. In which they explain to them in what the idea consist. Next they should send a letter home in which the idea is well explained but this time parents have to sign the letter and say wether they agree to the implement of the idea or desagree. Finally after doing all this now the school can decide wether the idea is being implemented or no.

In conclusion I disagree with implementing this idea to my school because it will affect the school instead of helping it. I would say that this idea have a lot of desadvantages too. For example the school might cancel after school activities, some students might lose their jobs, and we will get home more tired. I think that the schedule thath my school have right now is just great because students play sports, participate in after school programs, and some others can work too. I think that my school should not implement this idea because we are fine with the schedule that we have and adding two hours will just affect us instead of being beneficial.

We accomplish more if we are always doing something because people accomplish more when they are working for it and people get more satisfaction in what they are doing.

First, we accomplish more if we are always doing something because people accomplish more when they are working for it. The people wants to get more when they are doing something important. After this people get better because they are always doing it. Also they are doing good things and they get more things done.

200671752EE0,"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something? Yes we accomplish more if were always doing something but only if what we're doing benefits us. Why? Because if we're always doing something then we would succeed more in life, we would always be active and doing something productive. But it also depends on what kind of activities your doing and if what your doing is going to benefit you later on in the future. Because if what your doing isn't benefiting your future then there's no point of doing something that doesn't help you out for later on in life.

For example sports, if your always doing sports then that would be great way to benefit your future and also a good way to stay active. The reason I say this is because by playing sports you could have many different opportunities. Like getting scholarships into different universities, especially if you're great at playing the sport. And also it's another way to help you stay fit because your always doing some type of exercise in any kind of sport. So that brings me to my next example.

Another example is exercising, if you like exercising, going to the gym and just being active in general then that's another great thing to do that'll help you accomplish and benefit your future. Why I say this is because by being active it's going to help you to always stay fit and healthy. And how that benefits you in the future is because whenever you get older you won't have that many health problems or issues with your body so you'll always stay fit. What'll also help out a lot is by always eating healthy so that's something else you could do to help you accomplish and benefit your future.

Also working is something you could always do that'll help you accomplish more in life. Why I say this is because if your always working then that means you'll always have money. And having money would help you out in a lot of things. For example, it could help you out in school, for a car, food, clothes, and etc. Or you could also save up money for whenever you might need it for an emergency. It'll also benefit you by always having something to do so that way you won't just be home doing anything.

So in conclusion, doing something is always going to help us accomplish more in life. I don't believe inactivity serves a purpose because you won't accomplish anything if your not doing something that benefits you. You always have to be active and doing something productive if not you won't be successful in life. That is why I say that you have to do something that benefits you so you could succeed in the future. So yes, we accomplish more if we are always doing something.",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5
205D590BCBB1,"Community, state, national parks provide a wide variety of interesting activities. I will write about an enjoyable way to spend time outdoors. I will use specific details and examples, to explaing why someone might find that activity enjoyable.

For my opinion i think i will like to have a community, state, national park that has two fields. One basketball field with soccer goals at the botton of the basketball hoot. Then last but not least a tennis court. That would be cool.

Then i will want the parks/play ground, to be split in two. One small play ground for little childrens under 9 years old.

And then the other one will be for kids above 10 years old.

Now i will describe what will i want to look like or have on the babies' play ground from a 2/3 year old kid to 9.

kids and parents will like to have tiny slides of a hight of 3 or 4 feet tall and have sings that are special for babeis'. Then little benches were they can sit with there parents. After that i will like does little horses made of plastic or metal, that you can move back and forth.

Then now i will tell you and describe you how can kids will love kids to have on the other park or play ground from kids from 10 and above.

So maybe kids will love to have two fields' because maybe they like to play soccer or basketball and tennis so one of them will be a basketball field with small soccer goals at the botton of the basketball hoot because a lot of kids like soccer and basketball. Then the other field will be a tennis field. What kids will love too is have to courts on one field too. Then for the slide i want four of the to have a hight about 6 or 7 feet tall and two with curls and the other two, just normal.

Then the other biggest ones will be of a high of 10 feet tall and i will promise you that kids will love it!

So they don't get bord and say; this is boring. This is for little kids, i don't like it!.

So this is what i think that chlidrens will like to play on. That is all i wanted to say.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5
20E194B18D0E,"The debate was using cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Some people think using cell phones in the classroom is not good because as soon they grab phones, they will start texting their friends. Some people feel that using cell phones for educational purposes is a good idea because they will do their work. I believe using cell phones in the classroom will distract students, they won't pay attention, and they will stop working.

First reason why using cell phones will distract students because they will listen to music. They will start using Snap chat, Instagram, and Facebook. When my teacher tell us to take out your phones, the first thing I do is to text my friend. I don't like using cell phone because I'll get lazy to do work. Without using phone I have responsibility of doing homework and classwork. One day we were doing a group project, so one of my partner was using phone and he was listening to the music. The teacher told us to share it with the class and give some more details while explaining. Three of us did what the teacher told us to, but the guy who used phone, he had no idea what to do then he got F for that assignment.

Second reason why students should not be using cell phones because they won't pay attention to what the teacher is saying. It will create a big problem because teacher will get tired of explaining and none of the students will listen to her. Even I will stop paying attention because I will start watching my favorite TV show. Only few students will pay attention because they must have their parent's pressure, without that I can guarantee that no one will do what the teacher is telling them. Without paying attention to the teacher while she is giving instruction for the class will make students fail the class.

Third reason why school should not allow students to use cell phones because they won't do their work. If I know that I can use my phone then I won't do anything because I get too lazy to do it. Without doing homework or classwork students will get F and it will harm them after graduating high school. When I was a junior, I was using my phone in the chemistry class while doing a lab. By mistake I dropped chemical on my phone then I lost my phone because it stopped working and when I went home I told the whole story to my parents, they got mad at me. They said, ""how can you be so irresponsible and why you used your phone while doing a lab thats why you have bad grades in the class and so on.""

As you have read, using cell phones in the classroom is not a good idea because many students will stop working. They won't do anything because students are addicted to their phones. Using cell phone is not beneficial because we lose the ability of working and focusing. Using phone won't make anyone smart, if they focus on doing work or listen to teacher that will make them smart and responsible people. Education is the key of success and taking that key will make you work hard.",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5

21EFAE02832D,"I believe students should design summer projects instead of teachers, what do you think? i believe so and here is why. Most students think more alike other students because most of them have the same knowledge than others but. That doesn't mean that the whole school will have students that could think like teachers. By all means this proves that there is a lower chance those students with high developed knowledge will be the ones doing the summer projects for others to complete. The students that do create some of the summer projects will make sure not to make them to hard or to easy that way the students doing them can surly keep learning during break without stressing about it. The students that make the summer project will also make them easier for there fellow classmates. Some of the students that are doing the summer project could be stressing about it but that also means they won't make it to difficult because they would want to get over with it already and focus on something else to get there minds distracting. So that we they cannot be thinking so much about school. As well as the students doing them won't stress as much about them because they'll know it's not to difficult and can do it any time during the summer, such being the last week or the last day so they can have all summer to them selves. Not having to think about school. When students aren't thinking about school that doesn't mean they're not learning it, just means they're trying to get there head off of something that highly stresses them about a lot of work or having to deal with for a long time and that's the only time they can get a break from it and not stress about school. The reason being of students doing them than instead of teachers they also won't have to do a lot of writing or work for starters. Students will be sure to not make them as long because they know what it feels like to get assigned a long and stressful assignment especially over the summer break that is the only time you actually get a break from school. Students also doing the assignments will help out teachers to also get a break and focus on other important related stuff they have as well. The students creating the summer projects can also be more open minded after doing them and grow they're knowledge as well as learning better and thinking of ideas more often for school. Teachers can review the students work and see how fine they do. The students who do well creating can continue to do so if they feel goo about themselves doing it for the other students that weren't so bright at it can give out ideas and help out the students doing them. I believe other schools and principals will be impressed by having a school with students creating they're summer projects and that is wonderful. I believe that having students create the summer projects is an outstanding idea for the community and school they will think of them differently and have a better picture of themselves. This argument has been good because it will open the eyes of many students and have them be brave enough to put themselves up for the challenge. If you believe students should create these summer projects instead of teachers write your own prompts to see what you guys have in mind. I think my argument is well stated and many teachers will surly think about letting it happen. Don't you believe so as well? Yes indeed you do.",2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0
22D02123C65D,"I agree with Churchill's statement about the role of failure ,because failure is a next step for success .The reasons why i agree with Churchill's statement is because ,without failure we may not know how to be thankful for it if we pass in the first place,failure shows us what did everyting went wrong and how to make it right for the next challenge we face ,faliure tell us or show us why are we doing it .For example ,most of the people fail in like every second, but there is no shame in failure because the more we fail the more we know .My father once told me that ""no matter how many times you fail it dosen't mean it's the end of the world"".

22F16C83DE10,"Students Summer Break Ideas

Most of students like to enjoy their summer vacation,but some educators feel like summer vacation is too long. Students and Adults decided to come up with different set of ideas to make summer break not long.. Some of the students are fine with having 2 or 3 months of summer break,and some people argue that there should be a year-round schools. A year- round school is were there would be 3- 4 week break in summer, a longer winter break,and a week off in spring and fall. These were the overall ideas that both students an Adults choose.

My personal opinion is that i would go with the year- round school because it would only take a year that students would go to school and have a shorter summer and a longer winter break. The reason why i choose this was because i prefer having a longer winter break. why? you may ask , having a longer winter break wil make students not lose a lot of school because in most part of the United States snows a lot. About 75% of parents have called in school saying that their children is sick and will not be able to go. These type of excuses can cause students lower their education and making up the work of days they haved missed. Instead of the founder of school saying their would be an ""2 hour delay"" or ""schools are close"" . Students can just stay home while having their winter break and not worrying about if they are going to school or not.

Having a shorter summer break can help bring students come back to school with a positive energy and a fresh start. Since summer break won't be long studens won't forget what they haved learned. Students are likely to fail if they would have have a really long break this is the reason why students forget what teachers haved taught them. Teenagers are likely to be more tired during the winter instead of summer this is why students are mostly tardy or absent. Even though i prefer having a shorter summer break, i still rely of the students that choose to have a longer break because it is fun to be able to go out when the weather is warm but at the same time i feel like is better having a longer break in the winter because is safer staying home when it gets really cold and when it snows.

Schools that are in the middle recontructing have to allow students take their classes out in the trailers. Even though public schools don't close when it snows a little they still have to reconsider. Some schools are constucting and students have to walk to one trailer to another to get to their class this why i like the idea of having a week off during fall and also when it's spring break ,It gets a bit cold and in some areas it already starts to snow. Having fall and spring break can bring students get their week off and take some time off before they have their SOL. It can also help refersh their brain and can start studying to be able to pass their upcoming tests.

My final conclusion is that the year-round schools sound like a good idea. It can really help students manage a lot with their education and also responsibilities. It can also help teachers not being stressed because they can also take their days off. School won't be that stressing if it were to take this idea. All of these were my own personal opinions.            ",3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0

23D5BA721F52,"Do you always have to be honest at all time?

Well do you agree with me because I do think you should be honest.

Well sometimes it is not good to be truthful because some people are crazy humans in this world. You should always be honest to your family. They appreciate you more than anything. I think being honest will always be great think for this generation. The benefit of being honest at all times because your friends will know your trustworthy,parents love that more than anything,and you're not a lair.

My first reason is your friends have more trust in you. They will have a better friendship most likely. Friends will buy things for you like shoes,shirts,and shorts. Some times friends don't like that much honest because they might feel sad and stress out like when my sister came back from Generic_City from college. My sister friend was honest but my sister felt sad because it was heartbreaking to her. But any away my sister is find now living her best live. Your friends will dislike your honesty and like your honesty. They might tell you secrets that they never told there parents.

Another reason is parents love you more if your honest in my opinion. They care for more than anything. They gave you a life. Even if your friend said something very bad you should tell them anyways because they will probably help your friend that is need of help. They love you more than anything. Being honest to your mom and dad are the most. In the past I will always lie and you can picture the next thing. Sometimes parents hate when there child tells everything to there cousin,and which my mom hates children .

My last reason is your not gonna be a liar if you become honest at all time. In my religion if you are liar or not honest at anytime you are a liar. God will forgive you if you ask forgiveness. You will have better life and future. I sometimes like being honest because adults like hearing the truths and I wanna be that kind of kid. I like being that good kid and quite kid that loves being friends from a long time ago. I hate when people lie than walk and they try to be honest. Sometimes people I think should not lie and e honest.

In conclusion, the benefit of being honest at all time because is great for you. I think being great will make your family great as well as people around you. I think friends will love you more than anything. You are a great human being as like your parents. I think having a wonerful time being great person. As being honest everybody esle will be honest. Some honesty is bad for other friends are cool with it. God will forgive you as well as your parents. The honest person will always win.

Ive also been through that to where I want to succead at something that I want to achieve and theres failure down the road. Once I failed I told myself to be positve about it and not just give up or get stressed about it and know that I needed to work harder at it.

There are people who want to have succes but forget that its not that easy. People have to remember that it takes time and to have patience,and stay positive. Its not easy because that person has to work hard and show effort but even after showing and doing all those things there still can be failure. When somebody fails its better to think about what can be down next time and to try harder after the first try.

Anybody could lose confidence or the energy after they keep failing but he or she forgets to see what can be down better next time. After that to check what has gone wrong and not lose confidence because eveybody has the potential to do anythung. Failure will always be there but it plays an important role for that person to remember that nobodys perfect and that theres always mistakes. The important part is to keep trying and to fix that mistake and to keep that energy up and confidence that it can be done its mot impossible.

I've also been through this to where i have a big dream and i chase after it and I think its easy but then i realized it was starting to get harder. After i tried so hard to keep working and trying i lost confidence after i kept failing again,and again. Its better to stay positive because people might say that i cant do it or many things that can cause me to lose confidence. But i choose to stay posive because i realized nobody is perfect even artist,singers,and many other things that people wanted to be because they also had mistakes and had to try harder next time. I realized after failing there were improvements better then the last time i tried and it kept happining becuase i tried harder each time but eventually i got there. Its best to know that in order to have success theres failure but it has to movitate to try harder next time and then eventually when someone works hard enough they have success.

Students should have the right to pick a class because its what they want to learn about. It should not be required, the school shouldt make you take a class that you may not like. We as Students can make these type of decisions or we can choose something new, Students can pick new classes and learn something new.

School's should make these Kids take these certain type of classes because it helps you and its mandatory. for example, if you take art class then you will need to take drama class too. Both of these classes will help each other and you will have background knowledge. The school is basically trying to help you by doing this method.

253B2D521F14,"Do you think starting a career at a young age is good? Many students think that starting a career at a young age is good, but its is not a good thing for them or in general. Students often choose to start it at an early age because they could be really excited about it. I think that them focusing on their studies until they get older is even more better, and it would be a great thing to do. And instead of the young students hanging out with their friends at somewhere thats unrelated to their career or studies, they should maybe go to a tutoring center or help each other. Students should also have time to think about and choose a career that they think they would focus on really well. If students start a career at a young age, it can have quite many consequences. Usually doing so would make them more likely to have failure in their career, lack of some education, and they won't get much respect from people.

One of the reasons why I think that students shouldn't commit to a career at a young age is because they will more likely to have failure in their career. If they have failure in their career, there will be many problems. One of the problems that could happen is that they could get sued if if they end up doing something wrong. Another thing that could happen is that they could get many complaints about things. And if people complain about them and if they make bad reviews about them, it will make their image look bad. And for that they might not be making a lot of money out of their profit, because people know what failures they are.

Another reason why I think that students shouldn't commit to a career at a young age is because they will lack some education.

If they lack some education, they won't be able to know a lot about their career. Its just like a chicken is running to get to the other side of the road with his head cut off. One thing they will also have trouble in is interviews. They will not be going to get success if they don't know much. And if they don't know anything about their career, that person could get fired. One of the things that they would also be doing is making a lot of mistakes. The students should stay much longer in school to get proper knowledge of that career so that they will earn success.

Another reason that students shouldn't commit to a career at a young age is because they won't get respect as much as a well educated person that knows all their studies and who knows a lot about their career, if they do so. People would probably ask them that why didn't they take their studies further. Also, and what they could've done before to fix this situation is that they could've gotten help from others such as their friends, teachers, by staying after school for extra help, or asking their parents to hire a tutor. Additionally, or what they could do instead of getting extra help, is that they could just focus in their career class and not slack off. They should also do a career that they're interested in. Because a lot of the times when they see that one of their friends chose this one career, then they will do the same one. That's why young students should always think and choose very wisely when it comes to picking career.

Young students should focus more on their studies and shouldn't commit to a career at a young age. They should all focus, and they should keep studying until they get much older, rather than choosing a career at a young age. It is also a very important to not have failures and mistakes in your career, so that your career turns out to be good. I think that young students should always study, and never lack any sort of education. Also, and that they should get the most of education to gain much more of peoples respect. By doing all of these things as a young student, they will achieve great success. By them not doing these things, they won't get much of their career success.",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0

If you have a positive attitude and you work hard today or tomorrow you will become successful. If you have a positive attitude in a hard situation,you will feel like the situation is not hard and you will get over that situation.

We can even take example of some successful people in the world like Steve Jobs who was forced to leave his own company but he always had a positive attitude,it doesn't matter what the situation was and 3 years later he bought his company back,not only that he had a heart disease and he was supposed to die but his will power and positiveness saved him. We can also take example of famous soccer player Christiano Ronaldo who was discriminated because of his color faced all of his hardships with a smile on his face he stayed positive in his whole life and now he is one of the greatest soccer player in the history. He just thought positve things in his life and overcame most of his hardships.

In the modern world, if we even lose a small game we lose hope of winning again,but we have to change this thats not life works, everyone have hardships in their life but a smile on your face can make those hardships easy. Just think how to overcome that situation,instead of losing hope and stay positive.

In the end,I would just say that everyone face hardships from a 1 year old kid to a old man but a staying positive can change the whole situation because you will be able to overcome anything.

25BFEA75C65A,"After reading the prompt I might think we have to make some change to the school like, what was said in the prompt we have to change the school days to a four day school week and make them to be two hours long. it can give people the hours that they need for other things and can give them time for project and stuff of that matter.

The reasons why, I think we should do this because we can get more hours in the day to do things like for example: sports,homework,helping others, getting more rest in the day because maybe some people might not get more sleep during the night,some people might have job, students might have to go with their parents on a trip to somewhere or some place or also a school trip that they might go on. I well think that this is a good position to be for the change of the hours but to ever good thing there must be a bad like, a bump in the straight road ahead of you. I think for myself I do agree but there are some people that might not agree with my train of thoughts. The people who many not agree will probably say that there are not many hours in school to do things like learning new things.

My train of thought thinks that we must go this way of the four day school week plan. There are so many beliefs of going this way that means we can save more resources and teachers can plan things up ahead for his/her students. I must say that there are some disadvantages of students having a four day week of school like students forgetting the things that they were teach in class and students can also not be ready for class.

Some in conclusion: there are bad and good thing of having a four day week of school plan but there are some disadvantages of having it like what I said people might disagree with you but don't let them change your own train of thoughts. people also might not agree with your own believes but don't let them change who you are but the disadvantages are hard but the students can probably somethings pull it off.

26E2AD762E9B,"Duke Ellington said that, "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best"". I do agree on what Duke Ellington said. My reasons for this quote are because of You can show what you can do, You can learn what you need to know, and You can help other people show what they can do.

First, In any problem l can beat it there is nothing in my way to stop me from getting to goal. For example l had to pass a test in order to pass the class. l took my time l read the question over and over again. When l felt that my eye's whore going to fall out l kept going. I told that test who was the boss. I showed it what l knew. In addition l was on the football team l had to know the play's. In order to start in the next game l had to show everyone and the couches l knew the plays. Later in the day it was time for me to face my problem. After 23 catches l showed my team mates and couch l knew the plays. In other words try your best at everything.

Secondly, l dont know everything in the world. For example I had a good friend named Generic_Name had a girlfriend named Generic_Name they both had a great and good times together. One day Generic_Name wanted to go ice skating. One thing she didn't know Generic_Name hatted skating. When Generic_Name was little he loved skating, but one day he fell trying to do a 360 spin and he broke his leg ever sense that moment in Generic_Name life has not been the same. Generic_Name said the pain felt like 100 gun shot to the leg. The doctor told Generic_Name to take 3 pills a day to make him fell better. The doctor also said 20% of people break there leg a year you will be fine. Year passed by to the present Generic_Name was talking to Generic_Name it's time to go ice skating Generic_Name didn't want Generic_Name knowing what happened. Generic_Name told him self let's go. As soon as he got on the ice he fell Generic_Name started to laugh the she said you got some learning to do. Generic_Name said l guess your right.

Lastly, l could and will always help someone beat their problem and try there best. For example l needed help on this paper for science l didn't know a single thing. My Brother Generic_Name knew a lot about science me and Generic_Name didn't really help each other a lot , but for some reason he helped me finish the paper. l asked him why did he help me he said you looked like you needed help. l wanted to see you do good in life and face your problems and beat them, But sometimes you need some help from other people. In addition Generic_Name wanted me to get a good grade on that paper he told me that your never alone. In other words there is nothing wrong with getting help on anything.

In other words, A problem is a chance for you to do your best wise words from Duke Ellington. I agree 1,000% on what he said everything you do should be at your 100%. You can show what you know, You can learn what you need to know to get better, and You can help others show what they can do to face their problems and beat them. The last thing l will tell you is stop taking the easy way and take the hard way to see if you can do it.",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5

Sharing answers, Help each other if stuck in proplem, and get to finish on Time

First, Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone, Because sharing answers helps me learn New thins to learn about new answers to thing about because I,m not that good in English speaking, For example i got Generic_Name, My English 11 Teacher Gives the hole class a paper to Read and answer, By the time i finish reading i ask my tracher if i could let Generic_Name to be my partner so we could help each other and get it done on time by helping each other and share our answer to see a diffrent thoughts of each one of us,

Secondley, Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone, Because Its fun to work with a person or more, For example in History Class, when the teacher got to let us do class work for tomorrow exam or test, she let us do a group of 4 and do a challege in a computer so we could learn and do fun in the same time.

Third, Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone.

Conclution, Some people may say Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone, But Sometime i like to work a lone because i could think of my answers and question and even could get my own grade but sometimes when i work in a group when i try to work and care about my work but the rest of my grop does not care so if no body has worked then the hole group will get a zero even the person who worked.",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0

Reasons

1-difficult.

2-Get distracted.

3-confused.

First i don't think students would be benefit to attend classes from home. It can be hard if they don't undertand something. Is not the same the class in the computer to have a tecacher explaining you. If you have a question it's difficult to ask to the computer unlike to ask to a teacher.

Second i don't think students would be benefit to attend classes from home they can get distracted for anything. If they get lazy they can say they going to take the class later. if they want to watch a movie they going to forge thinks about the class. They can get distracted for anything like the phone,music,and the TV.Attend class from home would not benefit students if they want to hang out with their frinds they can leave the class in any moment unlike if they have a teacher giving the the class in the school they can respect the class,put more antention,and understand better the class.

Third i don't think students would be benefit to attend class from home they can get confused with the class. if the take the class online they can read the direction but sometimes even reading the directions students get confused.

is better to attends the classes in the school so a teacher can help students with anything students will need. teachers have the experience to explain students what they need to do about the class. attend classes online students basically are alone so is more confused to understand the class. in school if students get confused they can ask to someone else to understand. at home they dont have anybody so they have to think alot to understand. attend classes from home can affect students grades for less knowledge about the class unlike in the schools they have many opportunities to learn better.

In conclusion students would not be benefit to attend classes from home they can get distracted for anything. It can be more difficult to them to undertand the classes. they can get confused with things about the class for not have a teacher with them personality to be helping them to undertand the class.",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.5

People can change their first impression if they know more about each other, for example if a person that meet another at the mall they will have no time to talk about what they like to do in their free time because they has to make their purchases and my friend Generic_Name has a story with a girl that he likes, he said that was difficult to talk with her because that first time he talk to here was in the lunch line and she was hungry so she dont even pay attention to him, one day both of them have detention they star talking and meet more about each other, people can change their first impression if they give the according time to each person.

A person can fix his first impression if that person was no notified about what struggles was happened the other person that day, for example when the Algebra teacher meet Generic_Name, he said that Generic_Name was quiet because Generic_Name do not like talk to much, one day Generic_Name said that he just come from El Salvador and do not speak too much English and a person that has lost a family-member if someone tried to meet him on those days anyone will be said that he's must depress or sad because non of them know the truth.

When those student who want to graduate from high school in three years. they must work hard for their school. and they have to pass a lot of test and SOL. To graduate from high school. then they can go to college.

example;people who are's emigrant,and want to do the three years of high school;they have to work hard.

When student want to do the offer programs three year of high school. i believe they have to work hard. To pass their classes. Also getting good grad for their classes, i believe that they must study hard, and be properer for any test that is coming on. They must pass their classes by receiving good grad. Also to receive a good GPA for their record, Students must attend every day because if they do not do that, it will effect their grad. Then they get behind. from a lot of things.

example, student have to work hard in their classes to receive a better grad.

Student who is taking summer school, and work really hard to graduate from high school. I believe they will have a better future for their life, and their family.

Because student will have the capability in the future to find a good job that they wanted. Also those student will have the capability to go to good college to study will. I believe having a good back round from high school any college will accept those student; Also a good GPA, and those student who want to do three years of high school. Must attend every day to do not get behind from their classes, Because not being at school will effect their grad. Also student must work hard for their graduation.

Also i believe there are some student who have to work full time. Also come to school full time, and they are in the three years of high school program. i believe it will be hard for those student who go to school and work after school. there will short time for those student, to study for their lesson from classes. Specially for those student who is emigrant and do not know any thing about they new school. But still they have to work so hard to complete three years of high school. to graduation.

example;student will the opportunity early graduation; if they work hard.

I believe that three years of high school going to be hard for student. But it is a good opportunity for those smart student to graduate early from high school. then they can start their college earlier. because it gave them capability to make up their life Earle. Also those student will learn a lot of lesson during high school, and after high school.

If the student start their summer project student can be creative with their work by putting effort into it. student can choose if they want to do it colorful and creative or plain student have a choice if they want their work all bright and pretty or simple and plain. If the student choose colorful and creative there work might include with picture, color, detail, and what they might do during break showing that whoever made this work put a lot of thought and effort into it. If the student want to be simple with their work they might include white background, all word telling what they do during break, and a lot of mess of pencil mark. whatever they choose to be creative or not they will end up using their head to come up with these idea and student can make their project exciting or boring it up to them.

If student do this summer project and let the student to do their designed it will show that student put a lot of work into their project. The most difficult part of this project is come up with good idea to do. Coming up idea can be hard and stressful it show that student put a lot of thought into their work. While student work on their design something they think what would be great to put into their design like color if so what kind would be best, picture if so what kind,and patter. After they finish student need to check if they like it or not and they have to check if they any mistake. When you look at the work it show student put a lot of thought in their project.

In Conclusion Some school require student to do summer projects to assure they continue learning even during break, should these project be teacher or student designed. During break the Summer Project should be student designed. student can start this project anytime they like, they can make their design exciting or boring, and show that student put a lot of effort into their work. If student have a choice of teacher give idea to write about or student come up with one what would you choose?",3.0,4.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5
2B4AB39B1C76,"Yes there should be one way to improve student achievement to start an after school homework club in my school, because there's allot of student that really need help on there homework, teacher should stay with student that need help with that class homework so they can understand more what there learning in there classroom so they don't get confused on that time of a test, they can get a good score because they have study with there homework and they have get allot of help from there teachers. But some student don't like doing homework when that teacher ask them if they should stay with them student don't even stay after school and that teacher gets really mad because some times they takes time that day to stay with a students and they don't even show up.

Teacher take time of there social life to help student for there homework to do good on there report card because some teacher care about homework that student needs to complete it on time or that teacher give them more time and they still don't even do it that's why some teacher don't give no extra time any more, that teacher tell them if they want a A's or F's on there report card because they don't finish there homework, there should be a only homework club after school so other teacher should not stay and do work for that next day, but someone student throw there homework on that trashcan because they don't care about how hard teacher work to give them a good education to stay after school.

Some student understand that homework and finish really early, that student should help other on there homework and do a after school club and help each other on what they do need help on,but went teacher let student help each other they only like playing or talk and not even help with that homework, but if they don't know each other they do finish and help, but some student don't like went someone else is helping them because they don't explains how a teacher will explains to them because some student only give them that answer and that how they don't like other student helping them because some teacher ask how they got that answer and they don't event know how to explain to a teacher that how that teacher know that they copy someone else.

Student achievement will grow allot bigger if they start after school club teacher and student volunteer to help other that are really begin of homework and other works will help them if there was a only homework club because some student don't even do it because they dont understand or they forget to do it but if they do it after school there not going to have to much difficulty on there homework any more, some subjects don't have homework but went they don't do that homework they talk to that teacher that they had allot of homework and they forgot to that homework but they don't even try do work on it. some teacher try to help them to do it but they still don't even try to do it, they rather get a bad grade and not do that homework.

Some student want to finish their homework early went they have time they like to do it during class time because they don't like staying after school in class they ask that teacher for help or other student in that class because they finish there work on time and don't have any thing to do so they start finishing that homework so they don't need stay or finish it at home they can rest and don't worry about homework or they can stay after school and finish with that that student that finish on time and if they don't like working with other student they can stay with a teacher, some teacher like other student helping other because some teacher think that helping each other will understand more and they will ask question to each other to learn what there were doing in class.

Allot of student will improve there grades and there will do there homework early if teacher call there parent to stay after school to do homework allot will finish early and they will not feel that they got do allot of homework at home some student go home and play and they forget that they have homework to do, there mom ask them if they have homework and they answer with a no but went a teacher call them to stay after school that there kids have not do any homework in that class, that they have a F's in that class because they don't finish that homework on time and they don't care about if they need to finish that homework, after school teacher should award student for staying after and finish there work on time so they can feel happy that there grades are going up.

After school club in other school will help allot of student to do got on any test because homework helps allot to study and do good on any class but if you don't try to do your homework your going to have difficulty went it's time to take a test because you haven't even doing not of your homework or not even staying after school club, other school don't like doing homework clubs because they think that everyone understand that homework because know one ask for any help and never brings homework to class teacher thinks that they don't like do it, or they tell that teacher they forgot it home and that teacher believed on them and they get a good grade but don't even do it,some student volunteer to meet with those who either have difficulty and other student don't even stay other student takes time always to help other and other don't even thanks those student.

2B66CE2870AD,"John Lubbock is a British naturalist and politician that wrote a quote saying ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make"". When saying this you have some opinions about it because your past can also make up your character and who you might become later on in the future. Why should we let your character take control of us, we have most of the control by the actions we take in our life. For example your parents were very abusive, and somehow your going to be that way to no its going to make you stronger and built your character up more then it was before. We have a choice to make up our character like some people will say ""oh shes mean'', or ""why wont she share'' and its not her character maybe its her personality. You yourself built up your character and no one has to like it it but only you because at the end of the day all you have is yourself nobody else which is better then having someone judge you. No one can judge a book by its cover until they get to know who you really are and where you came from,your character can built you up and leave a legacy behind and you wont even know it because people will be proud of how you built your character up and ask ""how is she so strong ?"", ""how did she grow up to be independent?"". Once you tell them how strong you are and how your doing and the steps you took theyll be proud of you, because only you have control of how you can find your character traits.

No one can really know for sure what makes up their chachater just by saying ""oh yea I've done it before"" Lets say someone in your family died because of their sickness and you spend all those days being depressed and in denial that they are gone but guess what ? You are going to built yourself up and make them proud of whop they raised and who stood by their side and everyday your going to try and make every second count just to make them see how great your handling everything even if sometimes you might get sad here and there but,your still pushing through which is making your character stronger then your seeing it yourself. There are so many times in everyone life were they doubt themselves and want to give up because they think they arent capable of doing something but when youve realized from what you've accomplish the world doesnt seem so scary anymore, your brain will trick and say to you that you cant do it thats impossible and all these negative saying but, why should you focus on that so much thats not getting you through life its just bringing you down and you know that your character isnt meant for that its to push you and get you through all these brick walls that life throws at you only you can knock them down. So dont stop yourself from making a choice you know is right go with your gut and let your heart show you the ways dont let nothing in life stop you from what people think is impossible make it possible stand yourself out, make your character stand out because you are different no matter what.

Your life isnt a pick and choose its what you think is best and fits for you so the saying goes ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make"", its your life have fun with it and make everything you do in life built up your character. ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0
2B9C5C3BB7B9,"Studies have shown that there is a 25% higher passing rate from students that attend to online classes. If it wasn't for the advance tecnology the world has today there wouldn't be things like online schools. Now and days everyone has tecnology ether in their pockets due to there cell phones or at home with their laptop's , computer's , gaming system's and their smart tv's.

Now with this new technology the school systems' have taken advantage by making online classes, Therefore students are able to attend classes form the comfort of there own home. Some schools are given the students the option to choose between online classes or going to normal school classes.

Some would say that online classes would not benefit students i'd say they are wrong. These are some reasons i think that online classes are better and benefit's way more than normal school classes, because there are no distractions in online classes. In online classes students dont have to deal with things like waking up early, people , and much more. I had a cousin that took online classes and what i saw she was able to start when she was free she'd finish in two hours or less, Then the program would let her know when she'd finish the leason of the day. She was a teen mom and when she found out how easy taken online classes were she got support from the family as she finished with the help of online classes and her family she got her life together.

The people that say that online classes aren't beneficail might not have gone through what 80% of people have gone through. Here' an example in regular school classes there are distractions everywhere like friends, other class mates, teachers, aslo the fear of getting bullied. When someone has friends in class they much rather talk to them then to pay attenion in class. When in class you might no peolpe and it may get into your head which would give you another distracion. Now with a student that is in online classes won't have to worry about those issuses.

Even the simple things could affect your ability to be able to learn like what you eat. If you dont eat anything during the day you get hungry and that becomes a distracion. In most schools they serve horrible food with that students feel sick after eating. now a benefit with having classes online people can make food at home. After an heathly and amazing lunch they are ready to learn and too pay attention.

Not only is things like food vary inportant but time is another one. Due to bad habbits people go to sleep late and then they have two hours of sleep and going to school. Once class starts they fall asleep and dont learn anything. Since schools start early makes it wrose for the ones who go to sleep late at night. The lack of sleep affects the student mentally and physically, With a student that is in the online class can start when ever there free.

Last but not least what most of the students fear the most is bullying. In normal schools studies have shown that 80% of students have been bullied. That would mean if there were a table of ten students

8 out of those 10 students where bullied. Many people fear of getting bullied since what it was done to many students through out the years. What it dose is it makes school not feel safe for them and then they want to stop going. Now with online classes students shall not fear in getting bullied since they would take there classes in there house.

In conclusion i believe that online classes are the best and have the most benefits due to all the examples i've given. From lunch, time, distrctions and bullies those are the reasons students have a hard time to focuse in regular school classes. A huge thanks to the new tecnology for being able to help us learn without the struggle and fear. What i saw my cousin go though i can say online is the best piont blank. I've given all tmy examples and details also personal storys on the benefits of online school that is all i have to offer fairwell.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0
2C94D8BCF2F9,"How can we judge a person without know that person?

In the world there is many people different races,different social levels but everyone on this society is the same.

The people can be really nice if you take the time to know them.

When a person take enough time to know you and try to make a god relationship with you it would change what he or she thinks about you it can change his perspective about you, Some societies judge you because dont Know what kind of people you are and that is because those society dont take the time to look your personality they look at your society conditions and that is bad because it doesnt describe you. In addition if a person is at the lowest point of the society we dont have to judge how munch money they have we got to analyze his personality.

An example of this is like when somebody get into a store and that person is not wearing clean and good stuffs we dont have to say that person is a drug addicted maybe that person came from his work to buy something for wife that is something that we got to think.

The society can not classify anybody or generalize .

All the people has different kinds of mind some people say that the poor people is not educated that they are animals just because they heard something bad about them. That is wrong because all the people is not the same as god people is on this world, bad people is too maybe because somebody did a bad action all that kind of his people is bad too everyone is responsible by his own actions.

An example of this is like when a Mexican make a mistake doesnt mean that all the Mexicans are bad, that action says that he was bad but not everyone was bad.

Another big example is Generic_School in this school there is many Hispanic people as i, just because a person did something bad doesnt mean that all the Hispanic people does that too.

If we help we can change a bad perspective about a person.

All the people always got his own problems, some people is going throw bad moment, because we are humans we are not machines that make everything perfect.

an example is like when somebody had a bad day and you see that person by the first time in your life then that person do something wrong we can not say that person is a dumb just because he made a mistake we can not say that about somebody else, we can help that person talk with that person and provide our to the person who need it that will help to change our perspective and success as a person.

All the people has to have a second chance.

The society that we are is a society comprehensive where you as person can make everything possible, you give a second impression about yourself even if you did a person that gave a bad first impressions.

An example of this is when a person go out from the jail(everybody says that the people that come from the jail gonna be bad but i don think so,maybe that person went to the jail because he made a big mistake thats bad yes)and that person try to fix his life and try to make himself a god person for the society i as person would give a second chance to that person to show me that he changed a wanna success on his life, that would be really nice.

Conclusion:

Everyone can change his first impressions of a person giving a opportunity to show that he is a god person even if he did a mistake he would be god for the society. ",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0
2CAAF1F40F49,"I would say, i would agree with what albert eistein said. It is good that imagination is more important than knowledge because there are so many ways of using it in real life.

For starters, it can help you achieve something or somewhere in his or hers life. Because, they or you can use your imagination to invent something that can benifit the world or daily sociaty problems. It also might have you even more suited for more major important jobs nowadays. For example, a doctor, a sergin, a engenire, and much more.

In addition, it is also veritile on doing it in many other ways. It can't just specificly just of types of sicence studies. It can also be for political or finnetial studies, it can be about mathimatical studies, or about creative writing and jornalism. Politican wise, it can help you to become a lawyer or a judge. Mathmatic wise can get you still to become a sientist or math professor. And lastly, creative writing will help you as a jornalist, a author, a creative writer, or a activist.

Furthermore, without your imagination, your future no might be as good as you planned. Because with out a good job, you technicaly can afford a good shelter, food, or water. Plus at this rate, you might not accomplish anything with a humble life. So that why you need to work hard with your knowledge and imagination in order to have the life that your planning. Because if you don't do so that you might as well call your future doomed.

And finally to sum it all up, your immagination is a important key in your life that can even benifit your life or someone else life. Will you ever consider using your imagination when it comes to knowledge in your life in the future?

2CDDE76979DD,"I believe that working with a group is better than working independently. I say that because work gets done faster with more people than just one person. Also More ideas would be brought up because other people in your group have different experiences. Another reason is People can get different parts in the work so it doesnt all depend on one person to do everything.

My first reason why working with a group is better than working independently, because work gets done faster and is easier with more then one person. For example lets say i have a group project with 3 other people, I would split it into 4 different parts so one person doesnt have to do the whole project by him/herself. Another example is if you get stuck on some part while your working, your group can help you do it instead of asking other people that are not even doing the same thing as you. Also its easier because lets say Ur sick and you cant get your work finished, your group mates can most likely finish it for you so you wont get stressed out.

My second reason why working with a group is better than working independently is you get different ideas and experiences from different people. For example if you had a essay about living in England, theres a good chance one of your group mates knows something about it or has experienced it by living in England. Another example is everybody thinks differently, so another person might have a idea that you never thought of or it could be the other way around. Also when you have more then one brain working on the same work then ideas keep coming up from each other like its a chain of some sort and you wont get stuck on anything.

My final reason about why working with a group is better than working alone is your future. If you only work independently that means you arent really cooperative with other people or have much experience talking to others, which could effect what sort of job you get in the future. For example if you get a job as a PC support you have to talk to other people and ask whats going on with Ur device, which means cooperating with some random people and you need skills for that. Also if your a construction worker you need to work together to build a structure of some sort, so you would need communication skills for that therefore you really cant improve that if you work independently all the time.

Some people might say working independently is better than working with a group while others might disagree because work gets done faster with more people, everybody has a different experience and knowledge about stuff and its better for Ur future because you have to cooperate with other people and you need skills to do that.

2D8464A3BD5B,"One year ago. I though that business was the career that I wanted to study, but it was really hard to me. I could not do anything good in that class. I was fail that class and I was really stressful I did not knew what to do. I realized that business it was not for me, but I though that was to late to change my decision. I talk with my counselor and she said that I could change the career. So, I

decided to chose another career and now I know what career it is the right one for me. I do not know if I going to change it again, because I can be a undecided person. As well, I realized that happens every time that it was normal. I talk with my classmate, and they say that same thing happen with them. Although some say that is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students can select courses in their high schools to help them improve in their right career, actually it is a bad idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students might select a wrong career that is not right for them and students can be undecided in what they want to study.

Some say that is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students can select courses in their high schools to help them improve in their right career. The only problem is that they do not know that is a problem for students. Everyday I heard students, classmate or even my friends that said '' This class is really hard for me, but I can not change it because this class help me improve my career"".

That words make me think that they are unhappy and stressful.

The best way to help students is that they can change a new career. Maybe that career that they are starting are not for them or students can be undecided in what they want to study, and they just pick one.

There is a lot of reasons why is a bad idea that students commit to a career at a young age, but I just have two of them.

In addition, it is a bad idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students might select a wrong career that is not right for them. The dream of all kids it is to be like their parents. They want to study the career that their parents studied, even go to the same university they parents go. Sometimes is different their parents put pressures on them to studied a career that they dont want. So, students chose the career that their parents studied or they parents wants them to study . Then they realized that the career they pick is not right for them. This is a problem because now students are unhappy and stressful. Sometimes they wants to quit school because they think school is hard for them. When is just because they pick the wrong career. If someone do a statistic about how students feel about their career that they chose. I think the probability of that students said that they think the career they pick is not for them will be above of one hundred percent.

Also, it is a bad idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students can be undecided in what they want to study. There are a lot of career that students can pick, it is difficult just pick one. Students can find skills that help them in another career. Even though their skills are good in the career they pick before. They decide to pick another career. Sometime the decision that students takes are not the right one, but they continue experiment new careers. That is basically life is about, decision. When students takes a wrong decision in their careers. they are learning. Maybe students decides to learn two careers or more than two they take different course or classes to achieves their goals. I think students can be undecided in what they want to study and that is the best thing that help them in their career, is good that students can experiment different courses.

In conclusion, it is a bad idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students might select a wrong career that is not right for them and students can be undecided in what they want to study. Sometimes students can be very impulsive and can chose whatever career they want, but they not realize what career is the right one. Also, students sometimes could not decide what career they want to study. The best way to help students is to let them know what they want to learn. I think students will be more decide in whatever they want to study.      ",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0

There this program called ""Older students assist younger students"" .

What I think on this program that pairs older students with younger students is important because the students that are older already learned about what the younger students are learning about so they give out ways on how they learned it and show it to the younger students . Another reason why this program that older students assist younger students is good and important because a older student can also get more information from what a younger student already knows and not a older student.

This program is not only good and important but it also helps out any age ,in other words this program can help anybody out when help is needed. You can help out anybody and they will see you as there role model for showing them the good things you should do and what comes out of it from the good descion you did. Having a negative mind wont get you nowhere in live so that is why older students help around younger students because the younger students are young and still dont know what they plan on being in the future. Not everybody has a role model because they have there own plans in the future or because they just dont want to do what everybody does as a living but when they get some help from a older person who already knows what they are doing the younger students start to wake up notice that you got to do what you got to do in order for you to get where you want to be.

The only thing is that only some school's have this program and it sucks becuase there is some people who want help or need assist from someone who has already been what there going thru so if you have this program use it wisley and dont take it for granted. everybody in the world can get the help they need so they can be someone in life so that is why they have that program were older students help out younger students so the younger students wont make error mistakes in there future life.

2E5A3E5FD179,"I disagree, to have one and a half hour added to our school hours. It would cause stress and angry, to students and teachers. Teachers would have to stay longer at school to grade papers. Students would get hugry and sleepy and have less tie to play.

If the school board plans to add a hour and a half hour to school, then students would try to stay home. Students would try to miss the bus and try to get sick if theirs a test or anything that seems underwhelming. Students would get low grades if theirs a lot of homework and less time to do it, they would just not try to do it. Teachers would get more paper work from students and try to make plans for the students for them to learn a easy way, so it wont make extra work for all of them. Students would have less time to practice from sports or other actives if theirs more homework and if they are failing a classes and get kick of the team if they play a sport.

Students would be starving more if they dont eat breakfast, because they dont have time. Students go to school at different times so they wake up different times as well, and dont get time to eat or make something later. Students would bring food to school and would leave trash, and its extra work for other people who have to clean it. And when school over they would have less time to have something fun to do. Students would sleep and not do home work and not do their chores or stay up to do homework or study and play games. They would have less time to eat and not have the energy to wake up and get ready for school and to stay awake at school.

Teachers would stay longer at school, to do the extra work, and miss important things that they have to attend. They should get paid more to stay longer and deal with kids.

It has been said that people who have a great attitude have more opportunity to sucess in life than people who have a negative attitude. However, some people may think that a good attitude is not always necessary because there are job that doesn't required a positive attitude. Having a good attitude can help you to find a job, make new friends and help you to archieve your goals.

For example, it can help you to find a job and if your job required to comunicate with others people your attitude will make people to like you, also your manager will like how you work and how you treat the costumers. Furthermore, your attitude can make you the best employer in your job and help you to find a better job.

In addition, a good attitude can make you find new friends and they will always want to talk to you or be all the time with you even if they don't feel good they know you can make them happy because you have a positive attitude that they like. More over, you could only have friends that have a great attitude like yours because people that have a negative attitude would not like to have you as a friend because you are always happy.

To archieve your goals you may need to have a good attitude because when you don't feel good and you don't want to continue trying your attitude will help you to never give up and continue trying until you archieve your goals. When I don't want to continue in high school and I just want to get a job I like to have a good attitude and think about my goals and how far I'm right now and that help me to make me happy and to not give up.

Do you prefer working in group or working alone? There could be many reason on either ones. As a school project, i would prefer working in group. what would you like to choose working in groups or working alone.

I choose working in group because you can task for help when it's needed. If you get stuck, you could ask your partner for help. If you done understand something , you could ask your partner for help. If you got question you could ask your partner also. If you don't know what to do you could ask your partner.

Working alone could be confusing at time. Working alone could be hard and have no help. If you got a question you have no one to ask. Also if you get stuck it could be hard to get back in track. Working alone could get stressful. Working alone is not easy, you gotta think harder.

Working in groups can be easy. Working with a partner could finish up quick. You guys could talk about it. One could be drawing while the other one could be writing. Working together will be easy when brainstorming. You guys could be doing two different things and still get it done. When working in groups establishes a better relationship.",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5
2F93B934ED27,"Control Our Characters

According to what the British naturalist and politician John Lubbock have been say, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" Our character formed by influences beyond our control.

We should all choose to control our character because that will save us from trouble,

trust our self, and have a lot of relationships with friends.

First, we should all choose to control our character that will help to save many of us from trouble because being in trouble that very bad and many people will not talk or keep in touch with us or have any friends also. For example,

Generic_Name always many students keep saying bad stuff to him to make him fight with them, but he never care about what they say he always go to tell the security about them. He dose not want to be in trouble, that make them very angry because they are in trouble not him. That makes Generic_Name safe, and out from trouble. We have to be strong enough always and find another way to control our character to be in safe said, not being strong by fight and be in trouble. Control our character will make us trust our self.

Second,

we should choose to control our character that will make us trust our self because when we control our character we will trust our self in everything. For example,

Generic_Name works in the hospital hard to make everyone feel better, not sick one time one person was sick about to died, but she dose not cry because of that she control her character and she trust her self, So she give him a medicine and he dose not died he feel very well. Generic_Name never give up she always trust her self and she control her character with everything. We must control our character so we never give up and we can trust our self.

In the other side, some people may argue that choose to control our character will make some people think that we are sick, scared, alone. Thats true because when we choose to control our self a lot many people will think that way. However, we choose to control our character because that will make everyone want to be with us we will have big relationship with everyone. For example, Generic_Name always control her character she also has big relationship with everyone many people want to be her friends they like how she control her character. People are very likely to people who have good character and to people control their character that's why we have to control our character.

Lastly,

We all should choose to control our character to be out from trouble, to trust and believe our self, and to have a lot of friends. The result from when we control our character always we will be away from any trouble. Also, when we control our character we will trust our self in all the stuff and in anything even if it's hard. Therefore, many friends we will have while we control our character, friends do not like to have friends who is always angry dose not know what to do they like the friends who always control their character and who know everything. To control our character is not hard if we need a better life.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0

Its important to have positive attitude because there better outcomes having a better attitude is a big key to success it help when dealing a bad situation. Having a positive attitude change the way you see thing there much better outcome like seeing a smile on someone face because the attitude you gave them was positive and not negative.

It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Some people say that you can know someone's character by just the first impression. First impression are possible to change because they might had a bad day, and you always have to know the character before in order to judge it.

People all over the world are always going to have bad days, and that's normal because life consists on having good days and bad days; if you're having a bad day, of course you won't have a good attitude towards people. For example, some people can have problem at their house, work, school, etc... and obviously that's going to affect on their behavior and they might treat you good or bad, it depends on the situation. When you first see someone and they seems like a bad person, that doesn't mean he is a mean person; he can just be having a bad day or something bad happened. In order to judge someone you have to know the character first.

In life you can't be walking judging people just because they did something or just by their looks. For example,The majority of the population in the whole world knows the saying ""

Don't judge a book by its cover

"" this meas that just by looking at person from his outside, doesn't mean they are going to be like that on the inside. People might look either a mean person or a good person, there is some people that look like they are a good person and that they have a nice behavior, but at the end of the story they might do you wrong and you are going to be the one losing by trusting the person by just thinking they had "" a good personality""; However, there is also the people that looks like a ""bad person"" but some of those people can be nice from the inside, and you might need help from them at one point.

In conclusion, first impression are possible to change because people might be just having a bad day, and also because after you get to know the character as they originally are, then you are going to start thinking differently about that person. It's important for you to know the character first before you start judging that person, because you never know if that one person that you rejected/judge at the beginning, can be the person that you need the most in the future.

332F7B4392BA,"Former BirtishPrime Minister Winston Churchill Once Said That ""Success Consists Of Going From Failure To Failure Without Loss Of Enthusiasm"". 

In my opinion, the former Birtish Prime Minister Winston Churchill was right about his statement, saying that ''success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Because in life, before you achieve any of your dreams or goals, you've to pass through some difficulties.

Some people may disagree with Winston Churchill saying because they've not experince any hardship, or any failure in life before.

The reason is because they were born with silver or gold spoone in their mouth. They don't even know how hard ship is or looks like. Those people have no idea how it feels to be a failure, or a loser, or to even loss enthusiasm in life.

Even though, some of them are rich today, but they when through a lot of difficulties, disappointments, and they even lost hope in themselves to the point that they couldn't believe that they will make it in life because of the stuggle or hard ship they when through.

In addition, failure plays an important roles in our pursuit of success. The reason I'm saying this is because if you don't have any experince of failure or without the loss of enthusiasm, you won't know the important of that wealth you have or your parents has.

For example, my mother once told me her story that when she was in Africa in my country Liberia, she when through a lot of difficulties, disappointments, and hard ship during the civil war and after the civil war. According to my mother, she said things was really hard on her, and she said that she had no one to helped her to the point that she used to asked people in the community for food to eat just so she and my oldest sister can be able to salveged from hunger.

Second is school is a leaning environment not a place to be doing other things with your cell phone we come to school to learn! The third why i think having cell phones on campus is because we all have ore free time to do whatever we have to do.

The first reason why i think havening cell phones on school campus is because its really distracting and we wont learn anything because well be occupied on our cell phones. For example , we need to forces on more important things such as school work and maybe after school activates. I think we shouldn't be able to have our phones because 50% of students that have cell phones fail there classes because while the teacher is explaining something important the student us either messing around or texting another student which is not only affecting he/she but others around them.

The second reason why i think cell phones shouldn't be allowed on school campus is because school is a place to learn not use your phone in class. We come to school for one reason and one reason only at that is to go to school and get the education we need for a better future and all of the above. We need to help all students get ahead of life and have good jobs that they could all be proud of.

The third reason why i think having cell phones at school is a bad idea is because we all have free time i do understand we also have to have a social life and communicate with other students or peers. Not everything is fun and games sometimes we just need to expect the what our parents do what they do because they love and care about us.

We shouldn't be able to have cell phones because honestly its just a waste of time and we could do so much better and if we do a good job in school than we would have time for other things because in life there is time for everything but it also has its own time. we shoulnt be abl",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.0

The teachers have to give the lesson because so the elementry school students can learn more things.

Teachers have to pay attention to the kids to make sure that they are learning something everyday.

The whole elementry school can also help with the lesson that kids are having misunderstanding about the lesson is been given to the teachers. Teachers can help the student on the other things that part of the lesson.

If a student didn't know something in the lesson then, the teacher can help them on it.

The elementry school students should ask about the lesson. If a student doesn't know how to do the other things that go with the lesson then, ask the teacher how to do it.

344D7B1A7E49,"I agree with Emerson's statement. Why would some people never grow up? Some people may have childish personality so it's most likely that the person won't be able to change much. The three reasons are: your attitude, violence, and lastly friends that some people are using you and say some harsh things when your not around.

Some may say that some people will be able to change. They are wrong because some people won't be able to change how they act towards you. My first reason is attitude: some people won't be able to change to change your attitude towards them, and won't be able to change how you act towards them. For example, I sometimes have a very bad attitude towards my sister, Generic_Name. I always yell at my sister, Generic_Name for asking me to do something or give her something even though she's younger than me by three years.

My second reason is violence: Some people won't be able to change their violence, and some people my end up hurting their closest friends. For example, back in middle school I was always a sweet girl who doesn't hurt people, but after, when I cut my hair some people end up calling me names which made me upset and I started to get a little violent towards the people who call me names. I'm still sweet towards my friends who understands how I feel when someone call me names, but I also try very hard to control my violence so I won't get in trouble. The second example is: My youngest sister, Generic_Name gets violent when my other sister, Generic_Name gets her angry. Afterwards, she tries very hard not to get violent just like me.

My last reason is friends: Some people wants to use you for money because they wanted to buy clothes only for themselves. The other one is some people will act nice, but, when you leave they will say very cruel things to you. For example, I watch my favorite movie where the popular, mean girls are acting friendly to the new girl, but when the new girl leaves the popular, mean girls say harsh things about her so the new girl won't be able to hear them.

In conclusion, why would some people never grow up? The way the person is acting childish would make them not change that much. I agree with Emerson's statement, because some people can be very childish, and its most likely won't be able to change that much.

34AC1808D15A,"Some school districts offer programs that allow high school student to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years.

student who follow this plan must take courses during the summer or in the evening.

Is it a good idea for student to finish high school early?

I believe that is not a good idea for a student to finish high school in three year. The reason for this is because they might have a change of heart in what they want to be. Also having four year of high school gives them time to see if they really made a good choices on their career. Also ""will they go along with take courses during the summer?""

when it time to have fun,relax and enjoy the hot nice weather with family and friends. These are one of the reason that its not good idea.

Another way to look at this is to find out if there going to stick with the career they pick.

For example, when pick a job everyone look for better pay and benefits to see if the best fit for them . For a student it is totally different because they are look for better pay instead of look for a fitting job they will like an enjoy and stay at . Instead they look at a job that didn't suit them, then just quit looking and jumping from job to job.

Therefore i find it best if student take there time and complete all four year of high school so that they see what they like to do and complete all their goals and achievements.

Another subject is that entering college and the work force one year early is stressful with a lot of responsibility.

There no time to be acting out. Taking your time in high school isn't so bad there not as much stress, as in going off to college because of the expenses there will be.

entering college one year early is stressful there many reason. one of these reason is there no time to slack off its all about studying and getting everything done. where in high school you time to turn thing in later if there not fully completed.

As you see there a big different in the two, think about the choices before making a quick one.

In conclusion having four years of high school let them have time to figure out what they want to after they leave to see what they become. There no rush there time, to see what they want to be and what their going to do. There many goals that can be achieve also thing to get better on. Once you leave high school it time to response able for these reason i think it best to do all four year because there no rush on see who you want to be.      ",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0

Student who would benefit are those who understand things easily, and if they want to be alone to have a better concentration in what they do classes online is a good option because they will be taking solo training, and it's comfortable to take these classes without going to school they would have more time in home for example, I preferred to take classes online because that will give me more time to prepare everything that I need to go to work, because when I arrive from school to home, I have to do everything really quick ,things that I have to do like wait for my little sister in the bus stop from school then, I have to cook ,and that takes me time, and I have to be ready at 3:30pm to go to my work ,but classes online would benefit me because, I need help understanding classes like geometry or English is not easy for me to understand some words in English, and I need to ask a lot of questions.

35954693FE8E,"High school, the most perfect time to plan for the future. In some societies, students are required to identify a career by the time they enter high school. The high school will select courses for students to guide them toward the career they are considering. Some people say that it is not a good idea to identify career at high school because students are not ready for entering the adult world. While other people say that it is a good idea because it helps students to plan for their future. To me, I believe that knowing what am I going to do is important. Once people have their goals, they can plan and prepare for their futures.

How can people plan for their futures? By thinking about the careers they want to enter, they might also think about what are the things they like to do. They could choose the careers that are the most interesting to them and the perfect colleges base upon their interests. Also, people can have more time to work on their dream such as search more information, meet basic requirements, and get advises from their counselor. Therefore, when people are ready to go to the college, they won't be confusing about what to do. Because they have their goals with them.

What about prepare for the future? Well, some schools will provide courses that will fit to students the most. If the students identified their careers, they could do better at studying the related objects in college than those who haven't think about that thing at all. Because the students know what they want to be, they can choose to take related courses to learn the knowledge they might use in college courses for their career. Some people can even save thousands of money just by taking AP courses which will give them the credits that college will accept.

Some may argue that it is too early for students to think about their future by the time they enter high school. They have plenty of times to do that during their senior year. However, if students don't know what are they going to do after high school, they will have no idea about which college is the best for them and what career they want to have. By considering and taking the courses in high school, people could get to know the career and decide whether or not they want this career. It is better to change your mind in high school than in college. Because by that time, people will waste their money and time to change their majors.

Anyway, identifying your career when you are entering high school is a really good idea. You can choose the courses that are perfect for you and your career and also be ready for college since you have your goal already. Therefore, high school is a perfect time to think about the future. It is the entry to the adult world. So don't just doing nothing but waiting for someone else to help you to decide, after all, we have to choose our own futures right?",4.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0
35A1342EF397,"Is it good for a high school student to graduate in three years instead of the four year traditional? Let's call it the high school shortcut. Some school districts offer this opportunitie to high school students in order to make them graduate one year earlier. Based on my personal perspective, an early high school graduation is a very good experience for high school students. The high school shortcut makes student motivated to think about building their future quickly, increases the degree of their maturity and also help those students to proceed in life easily and faster.

High schools should make sure that students are motivated to think about their future and help them by making sure they're in the right path. Some students don't try to enter college right after graduating, some of them will take a year off and some of them don't try to enter college at all. By motivating to think about their future a mean that they would propably be more motivated to enter college at a young age than a certain type of age.

Going to college and start chasing your dream at a young age will make students more mature. Life after high school is something serious weither you go to college or enter the military starting it at a young age would make students more ecxited and make them became mature at a young age. So with the high school shortcut students will have the ability of gainning a lot knowledge about the branche they want to study young and quicker.

As soon as the high school students gain the knowledge that high school provides, proceeding easily and faster with the high school shortcut is and good opportunitie that should be chosen. Some of those high school students think that it's a waist of time taking a four years high school knowing that a three year high school that provides the same type of knowledge is a possible choice for them.

As far as I'm concerned, I strongly believe that the high school shortcut which is graduating i three years instead of four years is a great opportunitie. Either students who wants to graduate early or even students who wants to take their time in high school should take advantage of this opportunitie.",4.0,4.0,4.5,3.0,3.5,3.5
35D983476332,"Dear. Reader's

It's all my pleasure to be writing this answer, thank you for give me this opportunity to express my opinion and ideas based on my experiences. Even if my answer is agree or disagee; i believe that the life is short and you never know when is going to end. The first impression too but in this case we can know when is going to finish because is a big different between this two. I'm disagree with the statement that the first impressions are almost impossible to change, i believe that we can change the first impression but not in one second i'm gonna tell you some reason the i feel with my experiences that i want to know you.

First, ""the first impression the you receive is very important"" Well i'm not sure of that but is something that other poeple say, so we can think that for one moment maybe is true; because for some people is important the what other people think about them so put this case and the table and start think why base on my experience i""m not going to say that is true but i can give you one reason that i think. Well is depent the who is the person because if is a boy who you like you wanna receive a good impression but if is not pass the time you or him can change the impression because now you alredy know the person the boy the point is the time why? because the first impression is a second but also you can change pass on time.

Second, the impression is how you look like or the expression on your face good we find another point because is other impression the we can change and you gonna think how well this is a situation before one year ago i was talk with a person and she look in the first mad, but she wasn't mad the face of her was express mad but she wans't pas the time more and more my so my first impression was the she was mad now i think the oppossed of her

The time is the words more important in the life that we can stop or pass and also we can forget because his live in our life but the impression is something the we can forget the we can pass and something the can't lived in us because is something that we can change is something that we can move.

In conclusion everything is based on time and if you ask me that if is a possible change the first impression i'm gonna say yes because you never going to forgot the first impression the you receive from other person but you can also change later and your mind or in your background. Always we can change something thanks for everything.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,2.5
3691B4714FD5,"Conserving energy and resources, this is what the most part of the society is worried about, some bussineses are even adopting a four-day work week, each day consisting of ten hours; but should schools apply this model by extending the school day two hours? Well, I belive that schools should adopt this model because: It gives students a longer weekend to vacation, or simply to their favorite activities, second reason would be learning part, students will have a longer period of time for each class, which means they can learn farter, or memorize it easier; then we have the most important; the resources and energy saving.

Almost every student loves to have a loger weekend, one example could be my neightbor Generic_Name; he loves to go camping on weekends, sometimes he tells me, he wish to have a longer weekend, that would allow him to go even further or simply to stay loger at the same place, I am pretty sure that the three days weekend would make him happy, others may also be thankful, because they will have more time to do their homework or just to study. Me, as an example, I rather to stays at home and study; sometimes, I feel like the weekend went off a lot faster than the usually.

The second reason, which is so important for students, I belive it is; the longer classes that we will have, this will make a great impact on the grades of the students, longer classes will make us learn quicklier,Generic_Name my brother is one of those student that forget some important things about any class, I always tell him, ""Generic_Name study, do your homework,"" and he has already forgotten what the homework was about, I belive Generic_Name will get better and remember the homework with the loger period of classes; also in my class of science, sometimes the whole class is experimenting with some wird liquids, and we are still mixing when, the bell rings, my theacher, Generic_Name, says, ""it would be greatful, if we would have more time so we would be able to finish the experiments,"" and of course! the entire classe agree with what he says.

Some people might say that students would forget somethings during weekend, however the four-day school week will help to conserve energy and resources; there is a massive wave of air polution in this world, and one of the biggest is fosil fuel, millions of kids are dropped to school by their parents, if we start coming to school a day less; it would casue a great impact over the polution, it could reduce polution a lot, also the government will save a lot of money in terms of food sources, every day, schools give tons of food just for students, a non-classes friday could help to save that much resources.

As a conclusion, I belive schools should adopt this four-day school week because; it will make students to enjoy the new schedule, the three-days weekend, this will give more time to do our favorite activities or to study. It will also give us longer classes, where we could have bigger activities without being worry about the time, at least not as much as before, but it will be enough, and my last one which I belive the most important, society will have less air polution, and also the the government will save a lot of money if we get the four-day schoool.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0
36B2E183713B,"People and educators feel like we need to have year round schools, is that a good idea? I feel like we do need to have year round schools. Because when we go back to school most of the students don't remember anything from last year, we would get more days to understand things and remember it.

If we start to remember things we did we would not need to have to go over so many things and get to the new stuff for like Math, History, English. The more days were in school we understand the things more and it will stick to us more. Because the more that we start doing in class and we get help with it, we will know what to do when it comes for us to takes test or Sols.

Like sometimes when I come back to school I really don't remember what we learned last year or how to do certain problems for math or what ever class it is. But maybe with this year round school thing I might be able to remember these things depending what we learn in class. I think the reason we don't remember things so much is because we really don't pay attention or we're not really focused on what we're learning. So now with the more days we have maybe we could get a chance to try different teaching methods so the other students can get more attached to what we are learning about and focus more o things in class.

I'm liking the idea of this year round school, because there more opportunities we can have and more ways so we can focus because of the days were going to have. The only downfall of this is that are summer is going to be less than usually but I mean well get other days off so thats good. Hopefully with this new school thing it will be easier to remember all the information and things we learn.

I feel like that the year round school thing could work, it would help out tons of people with remembering things. So there classes could become easier because they would remember what they did last year and know how the problem or question is. It would honestly help me out a lot because I would be able to do more work because I would know how to do the work. I think this would work and be very successful so we can try and see what happens!

The first issue about year-round schools is more stress, the main thing students stress about is what clothes should they wear to school everyday it makes students to buy more clothes even when they have a lot of clothes because some students want to look better than everyone else in school by not wearing the same clothes everyday to school. students are not the only people who stress teachers will stress about what lesson should they teach and they will a lot assignment to grade.

The second issue about year-round schools is less vacation time, students will have 3 to 4 week vacation over the summer so student won't have as much vacation time as they would like to have because 3 to 4 week vacation is not a lot of time for student to go to another country for long time. parents will be affected by this too because some responsible parents can't leave their kids and go to another country alone.

The third issue about year-round schools is less money make, student can't work over the summer because they don't have the time, one month is not a long period of time to work you can still make some money but you can's make as much money as you could make in 3 months not only the students would make less money government will too they would buy for the electricity and water and other stuff.

Some may say you will have more breaks over the year, but you will not have as much vacation time over the summer.

3766B7A3A5E0,"There are many different ways to look at this statement. Even though Mr Lubbock does make an excellent point in his argument I do not support it. I believe that our characteristic traits have a lot to do with the people that we choose to surround ourselves with. We have all been influenced in a certain way by someone. Whether if that was being convinced into doing something that we didn't want to do or if it we were given a confidence boost to tackle the challenge ahead of us.

There have been many cases where someone gets into a lot of trouble by doing something that they didnt want to do. They were brainwashed into doing what everyone around them told them to do because they were the people who they truly trusted. But in the end they where just let down by them. For example there are many known cases where some innocent teenager gets a drug addiction because they were influenced to do them by the people who they were surrounding themselves with. This one poor decision has now changed that persons entire life by someone who they probably wont even remember their name in ten years. They wont get the opportunity to play in any sports teams because of their current state. People will look down on them because of what they have done in the past. They wont get the same job opportunities as other people because of their mental and physical state.

Because of this we should be able to love ourselves the way we are and we shouldnt need the influence of people around us to shape our lives, we should be forward and honest with people, if you dont want to do something they that are telling you to do you need to build up your confidence and tell them that you wont get involved in such a thing.

Does this mean that you will loose a couple friendships? Sure but at least you did what was right and you were able to take control over your life and make what you think are the right decisions. Now that person is probably going to get into a lot of trouble by what they have done but you wont because you were able to take matter into your own hands and do what was right for your future.

In conclusion take control over your own life and dont do what everyone tells you to do. Go with your instinct and if you believe that something is wrong then dont do it because it might change your future for ever for the better or for the worst. ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0

Feeling motivated helps you succeed and accomplish your goal. Its better to keep failing at something over and over again because you can see what you need improvements on but eventually you're going to succeed.

For an example, my sophomore year I was taking geometry and I didnt do very well during the school year but there was a point where I just didn't even care anymore. I failed all four quarters for that class during the year and I don't blame anyone but myself because I know I was capable of passing and succeeding the class. The reason why I didn't pass the class was because I didn't feel motivated and I just gave up too quickly just by a few fails I made. I kept failing constantly so I didnt even try anymore but If i would've followed from what Former said, I know I would've succeeded during the year.

However, I took the class again that same year during summer school and I knew I had to pass and give it my all. From all the fails and mistakes I made, I learned from them. I kept practicing and I kept motivating myself, there wasn't a moment when I doubted myself. By the end of summer school I passed the class and all I had to pass was my SOL and I know I had to work hard to pass the SOL so I kept studying. The same day I took the test, I was going to receive my score and I took my time on it but eventually, my teacher told me I passed and I ended up getting the highest score from the class. I was proud of myself even though I failed many time I eventually succeeded.

Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" and from my experience thats why I agree with what Former said.

Achievement is a major role for building anyones self-esteem because it lets you know that you can accomplish anything you put your mind too. That feeling you get after you have finshed something that you've been working on for a long time and doing a very well on is the best feeling ever. It makes it seem that nothing can get in your way no matter how hard it may be at first. Accomplishing one thing can be the start of many more achievements because once you have passed an obstacle, the ones that follow you know require you to work harder on.

The confidence that you build makes you want to keep moving forward and work twice as hard. Overcoming something not only makes you feel good about yourself but it keeps you motivated. It motivates you to keep going and setting higher goals for yourself.

All it takes is one to make you want to succeed more. Wanting the best is never a bad thing because it is going to teach you that hard work and success is going to push you to become your best.

Your true self-esteem takes time to build and small victorys like passing a test or even winning a difficult soccer game for your school is the start of it. Little things like those are the small steps that will make you strive for bigger and better things in life. Eventually all that hard work will pay off and you might be the top of your class.

I believe that there is more benefits for students to work with others rather than working by their own because they can share their ideas together and don't work alone allow them to be faster.

First, by working with a group students can share their ideas and discuss on the work they have to do. By sharing their ideas, their work will be stronger and longer because every person of the group bring his own point of view, his own examples or experiences and their own way to work, to proceed. While working alone can be difficult when the student have no ideas or is lost and don't know how to do his work, so in a group they can help each others to understand and push them to work For example, if in a group a person have more facilities on the topic than others, she can help others who have more difficulties to work. Working by groups allow students to grow and enrich their skills to be better because they learn from each others. Working with a group help them to be prepared for working by their own.

Secondly, working with other students can be more efficient. Students, by sharing ideas, are working faster because they don't have to find all by them self and do all the work. They can share tasks so one person have one job rather than do everything alone so it's more efficient and beneficent for all the group but also for the teacher because the work will be done faster, so the class can move on and do more things during the year and if they help each other they probably don't need help from teachers, so teachers can be focus on students with real difficulties. Working with a group can prepare them for their future jobs so they can be able to communicate to other people and learn how to work not only for them self but also for everyone and they learn to help each other so they will be more productive in the future. For example, if in the future, they will work in a society where they need to work together on a project with many people and their boss don't want them to work by their own, they already learn how to be efficient in a community so it won't be a problem for them. They will be already used to work with a group and they will know how to proceed.

Some people can think that working by groups can do the opposite and prevent students to work by talking, laughing, having fun with their friends, which can be distracting them or if a person in the group don't want to work it can impact other's work so it's unfair for people who really want to work and are motivated to have a good grades. However, students can keep working at home if they are late on their work, they can communicate by phone or they can meet during the weekend or after school so the work can be done in time or teachers can make the groups in order to prevent distractions. Also, if a person don't want to work and impact other's work, the person will be graded lower which can motive her to work or if it's not the case, students from the group can help her and to be motivated and push her to work by giving her little tasks to do or easy tasks.

In conclusion, I think that working with a group bring more benefits for students rather than working alone because they can share their ideas, their way to proceed and work faster by helping each others. If teachers want their students to be more efficient and enrich them self for their future, it's important that they do more activities and work in groups. ",5.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0
3DC3405DF531,all tho some people say online classes is good. they have their reasons. Tacking online classes i good it has it's bad. if you take online classes you can stay home and dont you don't have to go to a school building and you don't have to wake up early and go to school and you wouldn have to go to school and see people you dont want to see and you dont have to eat the school lunch you can eat whatever you want to eat when ever you want to eat and you wouldnt have to follow and rule you can make you one rolls and it would be esyer to take a test when you online classes cuz you can look things up on the internet and pass you test but when you you in school you have wake up early and get ready to go on the buss and you have to go to your classes on time and then you have to sit in a small class and sit in a desk and do your school work and you have to follow rule like you would have to go to your classes on time and if you do make it to class on time then you would have to go to the tarty table and if you keep doing it you would happen more then three times you would have to go to iss and what iss is you would sit in this quit room with out your phone and and you cant talk anyone. and is you dont go to class at all they will find you and put you in iis and they will call you mom or dad or email your mom or dad telling them that you wasnt in school and i dont know about you but my parents would get mad that i wasnt in school when they saw me go to school in the morning. And when you disrespect your teacher they will call security on you and they will come and get you and tall to you. And if you get in a fight with a student then you will be in a big trouble the security will come and get you and it its really bad they will call an ambles and this time the principle and the police and parents will get involved and the other person parents might press charges and that would not be good for you on your reared beauty when you apply for coleg they will see that you had a bad history and they wont want that tiyp of beaver in their school so you would be hurting your fucher. And if you do or take drugs or sell drugs in school then you would be in soo much trouble with the school and with the police and you parents and you could go well if your eithing and older and if your danger then that you would go to jive. and you would probably be kicked out of school and you would have to go to a new school and love all your friends and you wound have the same friends in the same school as you and that would be so sad and you wound have to go to jell and earthing so i think it beter to go to the online classes not that i get to eat all i want but becuth it a lot going on in schools that you have to go thour and you mith not like it i think it would be a good exprmnt to try online classes ,2.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.0
3E607F7C98ED,"My dad always said, Pass your class or no fun in life. First thing I will like to accomplish in life is passing school. If you think school is not an important aspect of you if you would be a fool, all of the well known people you know have gone thought school. I will try to take more years of school after im done, then I would like to learn more about the history of Africa and Asia even more. I think that learning about the future is something I would have never thought I would do in times to come but here we are, they talk about it all the time but never do it so I would like to change that reality. Therefore that is one thing I will like to accomplish in the future.

Have you ever heard Never knock it till you try it, thats what i will be talking about. There are a lot of thing I have never done in my life, one of them is playing music, I always listen to music like rap or pop. I have always wanted to do the guitar but i was too scared to do it. Now I take lessons for it, im trying to play it in other places. I have also wanted to rap I have it in me I just have to try and get my vocabulary up so I can say more in my music. I will start to take trying new thing serious.

Fact checkers say that people who always play sports will live longer. What I will try to accomplish is playing every sport. I already play soccer so I am try to play more variety of sports. I have stared to play basketball more, I think right now playing basketball is more fun than soccer. I have played baseball and its fun but it is not for me, but as I said this is what im going to try in the future.

The limits of your language are the limits of the world, once said by Ludwig Witgettein. In the future will like to learn more about peoples language and where they come from. We used to travel a lot but now corona virus has it the whole world and people are scared to go any where, but nothing can stop us if we have God in our life. Now it has kind of cleared up we can travel and see how people live in second world places help them learn from them and use it in our lives. It does not hurt to learn and accomplish new thing in life.

Last thing I have to say is I am still trying to accomplish always having fun and being happy. Many people out there are not happy or have fun, Doctors say be happy is the best medication and the worst disease is sadness. One thing of staying happy is being healthy, health is an important aspect of life it tell if you stay or die. People who take their life are those who dont talk to people, those who are sad all the time, and those who are not happy. Those are all my reasons what I will try to accomplish in life.",3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0

40331978F344,"When creating movies, games, or any other art, its a good idea to get advice from others instead of just one person, first off, its a good strategy to make your work more diverse, makes it more appealing, and more opinions is better than one.

First off, when creating art, its important to get advice from others, but the more you get, the more clearer and more diverse it becomes. They can tell you if you messed up and why. They can give you ideas to make characters to fill in the gaps, They can also help expand the story.

Second off, If you want to seem as appealing as possible, you should ask people for what they want and work with them. If you want your work to succeed you must work with others so you both get what you want. appealing to peoples opinions also helps your work by showing that you care. everyone has different opinions, one person might like one thing while everyone else hates it. appeal to the bigger opinion.

Lastly, the more opinions you have, the more messages your art will have. One person isnt enough to give enough opinions. instead of just one opinion, you should have multible opinions so you can give your art a message. listening and getting feedback from multible sources will help you and your art in conclusion, three good reasons why to get multible opinions is; making it more appealing to a general audience, fill in gaps, and get feedback.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0
405CEC6E7F5D,"Do you ever wonder if we should choose our own character by trait or let our characters be formed by influences beyond our control? I will argue that, we should choose our own characters by traits and not by influence. I think that we should choose our own traits, because we will be choosing our own fate or destiny, we shouldn't let other people decide our path and make a good character of yourself

Your character is your fate or destiny to choose on what ever path you should take. We all know that we should go to our own path to life and choosing what is best for our lives. You are the only one that can take control of your character and nobody should have the ability to take it from you. The fate or destiny is at the power of you hands and you are the only one to decide on what trait you will have on your character.

Don't let people decide on what path you should take and live with it. We should choose our own path to life and enjoy it. Many people know that we should be yourself and nobody else, we should be the character we choose to be. We all have our own character, we shouldn't influence people because you think that it is better for them. We shouldn't do that to other people because it was great for you, let them decide on what path they're going to take. We should only give them advice, but don't decide for them.

Make a good character of yourself, don't let anyone make you feel down. We are the ones to decide our own path of happiness. We can be many things if you believe that you can achieve it. If you think that this is a better way to a good character, then take it, endure it, make it worth it.

In conclusion, we should choose our own character traits. You might say, ""I think people's influences can be good for our character."" you are not wrong, but not all influence can be good for your character. It is what John Lubbock said,

""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""

40E6BC53EC01,"Just imagine you have an important basketball game at your school. Since you have three hours to get to the school, you decided to go watch a movie with some friends. When the movie finished you realize is already late, and that you need to go home to get the basketball uniform and your water. Ten blocks away your house you realize that the traffic is getting for ever, you feel like is never going to end,

that the minutes passed so slowly, really nervous, and sweaty. When you get home and check the clock you see you have just twenty minutes to get ready and go to school, your mom is screaming at you really angry because she is always telling me to be responsible. You arrived your team is already playing without you. Since you get there late Generic_Name tells, ""You are not going to play today, because you are not responsible."" I think a good lesson I can teach to the kids is responsibility at home, school projects, and sports.

First, responsibility at home is really important because is were we live, and when you are responsible you show respect to your parents. One day my best friend Generic_Name called me because she wanted to get a coffee and tell me she was really nervous of failing the year because she have not been responsible. I told her, ""I am going to ask my mom."" When i asked my mom she told me really angry, ""Have you fix your room and wash the dishes?"" I respond, ""I have fixed my room, but I have not washed the dishes."" I supposed that she was angry so that was an no. I tell

Generic_Name I cannot go, and she was really sad about it. Later I realized that I was not responsible about doing my duties at home. That is why you need to be responsible of doing your duties at home.

Next, you need to be responsible with school projects because in this way you get better grades. When I was in elementary school I remember I need to do a science project for the science fair. I wanted to get the first place of all the school cause I knew that i will feel really happy of it. I decided to do a wave experiment, but it was really complex and i knew it would take a long time to do it. I collect all the materials and build it, but i did not remember about the poster. The poster need to be really big and with the hypothesis, procedure,

materials, results, and pictures. I did not make my best work in that poster, so I get i ninety percent and third place. I feel really good about the results, but I learn that in order to be better we need to be responsible at school.

Finally, responsibility at sports. I did not know we needed to be responsible when practicing any sport. Just imagine you have the last soccer game of the year. Generic_Name have told you many times the directions of what you need to do all the week before the game, but you have not follow them correctly. One of the directions was eat healthy, but you have been eating pizza all the week. Other direction was drink a lot of water every day, but instead of drinking water you drink soda. The day of the game has came, and you did not get prepared because you did not wanted to be responsible. When you are at the middle of the game you start to feel really dizzy. Generic_Name and the nurse take you out, and tell you why are you so ill. In sports you need to be responsible of your health.

Responsibility is what make us be better. In think responsibility help us have a better place to live. I list three ways we can show we are responsible. To show the importance of it. Ways we can show we are responsible are making duties at home, at school, and practicing any sport.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

For the rest of the world you already a grow man or woman when you get your life together and get your own car, house, and family that you will look out for, and you will do anything for them like your parents did it for you and it will be the same story but from a different side and the one whos telling the story and you will never what your children to grow you will look at them like your child the rest of your life i did not get into i sow my older sister taking care of her daughter it was there when i start look ma life from a different side i might not be an fully grow man but i move out my house when i was 15 and i thought it will hard to keepup we the rest of the world i think before you take your own path and stop worrid about the rest of the world thats when you really grow up familyis first, second, and tird.

setting and achieving they work in the same position I think so Michelangelo he know that,if the achieving is low the setting low too because is the same he doing good jobs also if, he get a new jobs he had more talent.

I think the setting is too low because the system is too low so he need good system and good setting and than everything is work after than he can work very good .

my recommend to Michelangelo is change the sitting if he change the sitting for one high he need more recommendation for he jobs he need doing a lot to doing for he jobs and the setting is to short he need one bigger because the short is a lot problem.

Also I have one more recommendation if you need the new system just change is more better make sure the setting is not short because if the setting is short always are low but if the setting is bigger the setting is more high and not falling.

50% I am agree but the other 50% no

I agree because he have nice talent and he do nice jobs also I disagree because the setting is very short and low but if get my recommendation is more better and he have good idea but he have bad idea too so let me get the agree because I like he history

I agree because he used setting and achieving is two thing very important on this history he have nice history my position is when i read the history is to confuse but now i understand what he doing .

424005E31A04,"Do people ever told that having a positive attitude is the key to success in life ?

Well,that true for you to be success in life you got to have a positive attitude .

when you talking around attitude is how we act ,talk ,and how we deal with thing that are happening. Say that person you are working with and the person next to you do or says something that is not so great, and let say that you were really mad and very upset about ,and you choose not to fight or talk back to him/her. In my preview I would say you act base on what happen and you had a positive attitude about what just happen. Attitude can be a big problem for some people and Sometimes you just need to have a positive attitude .When your thoughts think that positive attitude is the key to success will you not wrong ,I know that when you choose to have a positive attitude it depend on what going on and how you want to handle the matter .For example you are on your way to the school and you meet one of the teacher let say Mrs. Jade,will Mrs. Jade asks if you are okay and she ask you if you are gonna come to school because you have many days of absent at school , and say that you have your own personal problems and you just don't want to tell her about it .So you decide not answer her because you are not in a good mood and you might talk to her rudely and she would think that you have an attitude or bad behavior and thought if I have problem with her or be rude to her it would be the worse so I will not say anything .That would it and you would just kindly walk way. Attitude can be anything in life attitude is not just the way you treat other it can be how you manage things and how you think and act with a positive attitude. When you think back it can also be something that create your connection with those who are in your surroundings. For example when you meet a someone for the first time and you were nice to them everything about you was positive and you were did not hind anything from her and that person might draw a liking into you .And you might end up being their friends or bests. The thing of having positive attitude is that many people might not act the same way as you ,so you have to be the one being positive .People say a beautiful heart comes from in and out of that person .It the same thing with having a great positive attitude when think about it people do and say what they want to said and no one is stopping them .So with positive attitude is the same way people do it because they want to and even if you say that you want to stop them I don't think that you would do it. Because it their choice to do what they want to do .Say when you want to eat can anyone stop you and if not then why would they stop you from what your doing .These things we do it so that our life can be great base on what we see we act,make choice ,and choose the right or wrong that why everything we do in this world we do it with positive attitude .And think about when you are making choices do you have to be a greater thinker or smart no all you have to do is have a great idea and a positive attitude to it when you say it because sometimes thing are easy said then done .when a person is saying something or doing something they have a way of doing and saying that this day .when people are talking they use attitude to do or say something and you have to away think that your the only one doing but sometimes it not just you it might be the other way around and you might say oh ,so that how it done .What l'm saying is that positive attitude can be a good thing to those who know what it means to them and why they are having it. Have you ever meet a person they're so nice to you when no body is around ,but when people are around they act so mean to you ,and some people are really nice to you ,because they mean it and they want to be your friend and when you at some of these thing does have something to do with positive attitude and most of them just put on an act and when your the one they doing this to sometimes you don't if having positive attitude or not everybody knows what we do in the future but I know one thing for sure .That if you have a positive attitude ,The your future clear for sure because when you about the future the only thing that comes to mind is how are success and all you need is positive attitude and focus on what you can do because believing is living .And if you believe you have to have that positive attitude going ,because once you start a journey one can never stop until it's end ,Positive attitude can be the thing that can help you do what other can't do ,if you ask why it because you have a life and that most of the people in the the world need positive attitude so that they can have a peaceful life and one most never stop until you find what your looking for. Having a good attitude can not only be the key to success in life but it can help you be a wonderful person. Being kind to someone,helping people,and making people about you happy and it can also make you happy. why ,because you have a positive attitude and when you success in life you will be happy. The thing is when talking about positive attitude can be the key to success in life, is like you are talking about happiness is a wonderful thing that happen in a world and make people happy. So when saying key to success in life your talking about how you act ,respect,what you do?, and how will you success in it when your looking for positive attitude so that you can success. Their are not a lot people who have a positive attitude in this world,but their are people who are bringing positive attitude in this world. When you think about success in life do you think it would be great if everyone had the chance to be success in life ,but to be fair life is suppose to be hard that way we can learn from our mistakes. Positive attitude help you be success in life ,because we live we learn everyone is a learner in this world. Because no one is perfect or wonderful forever.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

To be successful in life, you need to be positive and believe in yourself first. Do not listen what people say and don't let them to tell you what to do. Believe in yourself and don't take care about what they say and think about you.

To start, to be successful you always need have a positive attitude, the negativity will not take you nowhere. If you have a positive attitude, you will have everything you want in life. Also if you're a negative person it will not help you in anything. When you are a negative person you can not get what do you really want. If you want to get everything you want in life, you need to have a positive attitude. It does't matter what you have done for it, you always have to be positive and believe in yourself to have success.

Next, if you want to have success in life, you always need to have a positive attitude and a good vibe about yourself. You have to believe in yourself before something else. You are the only person who can be believe in yourself, and nobody else is going to do it for you. Every time you have something done for your success, think that you are going to get it, and always be positive. Do not let anybody ruin what do you want to be that successful person in the future.

Finally, if do you want to be successful in life, the only thing you need is believe in yourself. Do not listen what people say and think about you. Listen to your mind and your heart, they are going to tell you what is good for you. People will always judge you, it does't matter what you do. Don't let people to ruin your success, and believe in that you are going to be a successful person in the future, and you are going to get what do propose to yourself, it is up to you.

In addition, to be a successful person in life, you need to have good vibes and a positive attitude on you. Do not let people to tell you what to do when you already know what is good for you. If you let people to tell you what to do, you're not going to get nowhere. In life, nobody want you to have success, they don't want you to be in a better place than them. The only thing I can say is that you always need to have a positive attitude and believe in yourself before something else, that's how are you going to have success in life.",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0

When working in a group, you always end up doing all the work yourself or someone else copying the answer from your work becasue they didn't wanna work do their part of the work. Working in groups is not always a bad idea but when you end up doing the work yourself then it is. We sometime wanna work with people we hang out with, but in the end you never get work done. Someone is always doing all the work and that's when everybody copy's from that person's work, when they finshed the work.

To start off, working alone can cause you less distractions and it would also help you concentrate more on your work. For example, my phone brings down a lot of distraction to me, so therefore I put down my phone for a while and concentrate more on doing my work instread of being distracted on my phone and not getting any work done. That's why have less distractions and being concentrated more could get you to finsh more work on time.

Second of all, you also would get more advantage of getting work done on time. You would take your time to actually do the work instead of guessing or rushing to get done first. For instance, if you were working with a group, you would barely get any work done, but if you work alone you could get more work done than what the group would get done.

Lastly, you could actually think about your answers and why you choose that answer choice. For instance, if you were working in a group y'all wouldn't talk or think about the answer choice, y'all would just guess for every question so y'll would be the first ones to be done. When you work alone it's different, you take your time, look over your answer choices and double check to see if that's the correct answer.

In conclusion, these are the benifits for working alone and not wokring with groups, working alone is so much peaceful and easier then having to work with a group and rush your work and guessing on every question. Having to concentrate therefore less distractions, also having more time to actually get work done and lastly looking over your answer choices carefully.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0
4462E068017D,"This prompt is asking if they should reduce summer vacations because they think its hard for students to retain informartion easily after a long break.

Summer you can travel with your family to different places and have fun and not to worry about school things. Students should have summer break after months of been at school and they can take their stress out during the big break and focus on other things outside of school. You can travel to different places or countrys to see your love ones if you haven't seem them in a long time. Summer is like enjoy myself time because you can do things you can't do while you are in a school year because its a short time but summer is like two months break. Students can go to retake classes during the summer if they fail and they want to recover a credit for a class. Students that play sports would have more fun enjoying playing it because they don't have to worry about anything but stay in shape for their sports and they have more time to play sports. For the students that like to read a lot they have a lot of time to their self and can spend major of their time at the library reading tons of books. Students that like to travel a lot they can anywhere and later they can write journal or take pictures and tell their classmates how their summer went.

Bad things if they reduce summer break will be more school time. People wouldn't be able to go places because they have to attent to school and they would have to worry a lot. Most people would be stress from school if they don't have a long break like summer. Summer wouldn't be fun for students because thats when they all gather together and they have fun and enjoy theirselfs.

I think the school boards should not reduce summer break because you can travel with your family to different places and have fun and not to worry about school things. Students should have summer break after months of been at school and they can take their stress out during the big break and focus on other things outside of school. You can travel to different places or countrys to see your love ones if you haven't seem them in a long time.

First, kids have some problems to do their homework, or they don't understand what to do. Many childrens' have problem to stay focus in their homework, for example, many kids get distracted by little things ,or a person distracted them. Afterschool homework club is a great idea to help students, because the teachers can help them, and never miss a homework again. Also, they are many students that the fist thing they do when they get out of school is to play videogames.

Next, some childs know how how to do their work, but they only need motivation to do it. Teachers do fun games for the kids to do their work in a fun way. Many prefer to play games, and not to do their work. All students likes to play, so teachers make games that is related to the homework to the students do it, or make it more easier for them.

Furthermore, students don't write their homework in the agenda, so they forget to do it, or sometimes they are playing and don't remember to do their work. When a child don't understand something the teachers can explain them in afterschool to they understand better. If the students are in the afterschool homework club they never will miss a homework again because the teacher will help them.

Finally, the kids that is in the afterschool homework club will get good grades, because the kids return their assignments. If the kids don't understand something in the afterschool club explain the students to understand more. However, afterschool club is a great idea to help students, because the teachers, and friends can help the student, and never miss a homework again.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
45697CF2448C,"Do you like to extend your school hours?

I think extending the school hours do your life more easier because you don't have to do homework at home. You can do your homework in the school and you can ask for help.

I agree with extending the school day because I like go to the school and you have more time to stay with your family because you don't have to do your homework.

My first reason is I like to extending the school day because when the teachers give you homework you can do it in the class, and I like it because you can have more time to stay with your friends.

By this I mean, when I come back to my home I don't have to do any homework because I do my homework in the school and I can go outside and play with my friends. This is why is good to have more hours of school.

For example, one day I was in the school, and my science teacher give me so much homework, she told me I need to do projects, quizzes, and extra work but I told her I can't do it because I don't have internet at home and I can't do my homework in the school because I don't have so much time because the school end early. I go to the school principal and I asked him if he can extend the school day because many students need more time to do their homework and then a few week ago he told me,"" I want to expend the school days because I was thinking and you are right."" I feel happy in that moment because I will have more time to do my homework and pass the grade.

Conclusion, extending the school hour can help you to do your homework and missing work, and you don't need to do it at home.

My second reason is I like to have school hours because you have more time to eat and when you do your testes you can study one hour and not is a matter because you still have time to do your test.

By this I mean I have more time to eat my lunch and talk with my friends in the cafeteria, and when I have testes I do it with more calm, and I don't stressful because I have time to do my test.

To illustrate, I was in the school, and I was doing my math test and I was so hungry and I asked my teacher if I can ate and he said "" No because we don't have a lot of time, and we need to finish the test."" I was so mad because I was hungry, and we don't have time to ate. When the test finished we go to ate and then we have to go to another class but I was so tired because them don't give us time to rest .

To wrap up, you need to have time for everything and do the thing with calm. Is good if the school extend the school hours because you have time for do your homework, your quizzes, or your projects.

To wrap up, the school need to extend the school day because like this every student will have time to do what they need to do in their classes, and they don't have to worry about the homework in their houses.

I feel if the school extend the hours should be great and more peaceful because you can because you can do your work and other things with more tranquility.

I think if in your school extend the school hours you have more time to do your homework, and you can have more time to stay with your family.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,4.0
45A86623B659,"Do you agree or disagree about the importance of attitude? I agree with the importance of attitude, because with your atitude you can motivate yourself to do the best in your life, and you can motivate other people to do the best in their life. Some people think that in this life your positive attitude is the key to do good in everything, because if you go to any place, job, or to the school with positive attitude your life its going to be excellent.

In this life the success is the key, because if people have negative attitude in everywhere, they just don't want to nothig. For example, if they go to the school/collage with negative attitude, maybe they don't want to learn new things about the class, because they are going to be mad, and they don't want to do work with negative attitude, but if the people go with positive attitude they can learn averything they want, or learn more than they know about the class, because be positive means that you want be success in your life, also means that people want to do the best in everything.

Second, people can do better in this life with positive attitude, because they want be graduated from collage wih positive attitude, and with them positive attituted they maybe motive to other people to do the same thing, with their positive attitude they learn more, they are going to do work, homework, and classwork, because in this life the key is the attituded, that means everything you do, do with positive attitute,if you do that you are going to learn new things easy.

Some people argue that in this life you don't need positive attitude, because they only think if you pay attention, do homework, and finish classwork in the school/ collage so you can be success in this life, they only think about to be responsible with their works, not about to have positive attitude. People also argue that in the works you don't need positive attitude, because the only thing you need is experience, work, and be resposible.

In conclusion, if you do everything with positive attitude we can learn things more easy, and you are going to be success in this life, because you motivate yourself to do the best, also you can motivate people to do the same thing, to be success in this life, with positive attituded you can do everything, because you want to learn new things in this life.",3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.5

So i think the students should have a community service. The principal should required the students to have a community service. If students would decide to have community service they would do a awesome job by helping out residents and helping out the environment because your helping it out by not letting that much trash get in to our world. You would help the plants by letting them grow more and live more. Then will have much more food and vegetables. So i think having a community service is good so will help out the environment to stay clean and have a better and cleaner community. I think those students who say community service takes too much time they should just give some time when they are just sitting their in the couch and go help out your community and the environment.,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0

I wanted to reach out to you Generic_Name to talk about what my interests are . The school I attend at is Generic_school and I am 17 Years of age. I want to learn how to start my own restaurant ,

know how you manage the prices , how to run the business , and also how to manage people.

However, I work at a restaurant at the moment and I am trying to become a manager. Although, I heard you have to do a lot before you become one . I want to know how to run the prices and how to make deals because I dont have that much experience , and must know how to do that to become a manager. Furthermore, I researched your job and read the reviews your customers love your restaurant . They say it is not to expensive but not too cheap ,also they say it is worth a drive down their. Thats why I wanted to ask to if i could get some experience from you.

Moreover, I wanted to know how to actually learn how to run the entire business. For instance, if i wanted to open up my own business I want knowledge from an expert before I do. My school does not have the right experience that you have . Also, I had spoke to one of my classmates they told me that you do training classes for students that are very interested in business she applied and she told me that she got really far in her business and that she is already getting started. I wanted to apply for the training so I have a clue on what is going on so I can eventually start my own restaurant.

Lastly, I wanted to know how to manage people around , know how to be a right trainer for a perfect restaurant. Nevertheless, people say it is hard opening up a business if you dont have the right training . For example, I had a friend that decided to run a business without experience she did not know how to mange the line in the kitchen , the people in the front, nor the prices. Later on the business ran out of service and got shut down. However, that is not how I want to end my career . I want to go somewhere and be in a place where people will love to socialize with the waiters, and to get their orders right .Thats an important part on why I came today to experience the way of training.

Based on this talk, I want to start my own business and work on becoming a better trainer . Even though, I have no experience with running my own business, managing the people, and how to manage the prices . I hope by the end of today I can get applied and start my training so I can get some ideas on how to do things around a restaurant and start my own business by 18 years of age.

I agree with having the normal school week because, The majorly of the high school students have part times jobs they work after school and having a nine hours school day would not leave enough time for students to work in a part time job, There are some girls at high school that have babies, and they are paying babysits, with a nine hours school days moms would spend less time with their babies and they would have to pay more hours to babysits, With an nine hours school day the amount of time to study, do homework or prepare for projects would be less then a normal school day of seven hours that can affects students grade.

474D243CD03A,"Every students expect that they are going to have a great time in a summer break. Some students enjoy their long summer vacation because they do not have to worry about the school for a while. But some students want to reduce summer vacation and have longer breaks in winter, spring, and fall. There are some pros and cons on both sides, but I agree with long summer vacation and short breaks in winter and spring. Among the numerous reasons, my most important reasons are students cannot make a long time plan during the vacation; it is not effective to have a short shcool time and then have a break.

One of my most important reason is that students cannot make a long time plan during the vacation. I believe that many students want to go travel or want to tour other countries with a long time plan, but if they have short vacation, they have to worry about the assignment and school while they are traveling. Sometimes, it is hard to see everything you want with a short time, so you regret that you did not have bunch of time. If one of their family lives in another country and it is hard to see each other, they have to make a plan to have a wonderful time with each other during the break. They, obviously, want to stay together for a long time because they do not know when they are going to meet each other again; It could be next year or 10 years later. They, however, cannot enjoy their time as much as they want if the student have to go back early. Because of these evidences, I agree with the long summer vacation.

Another my most important reason is that it is not effective to have a short school time and then have a break. Every sports have a season and the players or coaches focus on their duty during the season; they do not have a break for like 3-4 weeks because of their body rhythm. I believe that it works for students, too. For example, people who want to be good at music instruments have to practice consistently; practicing 10 hours a day and doing nothing for a week does not help you at all. Even though the practicing time is shorter, using the instruments everyday reminds you and help you to get better. It is hard to come back to school after having a long break, but it is more effective when the students change their body rhythm for the school time than having a short break after a short school time. Because of these evidences, I agree with the long summer vacation.

There are some advantages on the other opinion because not every single person has the same studying style. Some of the students study very hard during the short time period and then take a break, and it works for them. However, this type of studying has a risk that the students can forget what they have learned during the break because they tried to put much informations like math, science, english, and history in a short time. Even though the students who cram for the tests or assignments can get a good grade, they have to go over it after few moments later. Therefore, it is better to have a long summer vacation than a short summer vacation.

As I mentioned, summer break is what students' best time in a whole year. Almost every students makes their own plans on what they should do. Students, however, have a difficult before they have a summer vacation, so some of them want to reduce the summer break and make longer the other breaks. It is not a bad idea to move on, but they have to know that taking longer breaks in winter and fall would affect their whole summer plans. They also have to realize that they can do much more thing with longer break. That depends on how people use their own time, but if you have longer break it would give you wide opportunity.                                                 ",5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5

In this paper i will argue of how the world is trying to change us day by day, how we get influence by it and end up changing, and how every year that goes by our generation gets worst and worst.

The world is everyday is trying to find a way to make us change, we as humans have stop, and think, what we want for our future? why would i want to be like everyone else? Do i want to be a wealthy person in this society? Do i want to accomplish all my goals?, those are the types of question that we should ask our self, and think deeply, were will we end up on the future following the steps of the rest of the world?, because in this world, if you want successful, you have to be yourself, the world is not going to do it for you.

We get very influence by world, on activities, the way we talk, the way that we dress, the clothes that we use, our religion, and a lot of stuff that if we dont like, or we dont do, we are not cool for the world. A good example is the clothes that we use, if we dont us the clothes and shoes that are trending or popular right now we are not cool for the society, and maybe the reason why we dont use it because, you dont have money, or you dont have time or access to buy or simply you just dont like it, and for the world that means your not cool or cute, because, you dont us a certain clothes, and is shouldnt be like that, because, some people get bully by that and some even get to a depression because they cant afford any of that and is very sad to know that this world is like this.

Sadly, by every year that goes by, our generation get worst and worst, and the reason of that is the world. The world has influence us, in such a bad way that is sad, all the new drugs that are killing people, the war between countries, the new artist that are coming out that just sing about drugs, killing people and sex is of a very bad influence for our generation and sadly if we dont start being our own selves, and start the right stuff, eventually we are going to end up really bad.

some people say that this world is bad, and just gives us bad influence, but they are not right, because is not neccesarly the world, it could be us, letting ourselves get involved or influence in bad stuff,and then say that is the world fault, when is really your fault, for getting involved on bad stuff overall, in the future, i hope that this world changes, because we still have time to do it and is not impossible, i just hope that this generation that is coming up, have the courage to change the world and make it a good friendly world.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0

There is always challenges in life where you would have to be yourself. If you can't be yourself then you should ask for advice from your family on how you can be yourself. If you aren't yourself and you've become different from yourself and its not always good. It's like letting the world win by changing you. You should always be yourself no matter what you come across, listen to you and your family, and don't lose to the world by not being yourself.

In life no matter what you come across, you should always be yourself. Don't let anyone force you to be someone else because you might not even like who you've become. People who aren't themselves usually are going through some serious stuff or just want attention. Being yourself is really hard when there are hard challenges you have come across that tries to make you different from yourself. Being yourself is the best accomplishment you can earn when in a world that is trying to make you something else.

You should always listen to yourself and your family. Getting advice from your family is the best because they've been alive longer than you and have more knowledge in how they've became there self and not anything else. Listening to yourself is good because you're doing what you want to do, what your mind is telling you. If you become something else and your mind was telling you not to, then you should re-evaluate your thoughts and be yourself. Family are related to you, they have similar mindset as you, and they should understand you more than anyone else in this world.

At the end of the day, you know who you are; if you aren't yourself its like letting the world win by changing you and losing because you aren't yourself. You're showing us you aren't capable of the world, you can't handle the world because you're not thinking about your decisions and letting the world change you. You know what you can do and can't do. If you know you can change then go for it and change. Changing can be hard but you should take it slow, think about what you want to change. It's a great feeling knowing you've changed because you know you have achieved your goal.

Ralph Emerson won against the world trying to change him because he realized people change and aren't themselves anymore and spoke out. Don't let anything try to change you, you do you.

Eating healthier will make people aware of the fact that they must change their meats and life routine, Also it encourages them to practice sports as the athletes students and at some point they will prefer so much to take care of their health by dieting, being familiar with the vegetables, fruits, and milk. And going to the gym constantly on purpose to build a beautiful body.

In addition, Eating unhealthier causes the disperses and the isolation when we became adults. Furthermore, this strategic will reduce the percentage of getting cancers and dangerous diseases in the future due to lack of knowledge of nutrition. Being fat makes our life more difficult imperfection, and tiny. It is so necessary to be flexible and active in our life. the spastics says that many people die young cause of heart attack that occurred from the unhealthy food such as the poison ingredients.

My primary reason that i support this action is the important of eating healthy. it increases our intelligence the students will notice their progress in school by paying more attention in the classroom. Also, it benefices our beauty of body by making the person looks much better and attractive. and it makes us feel so much powerful in our life.

In conclusion, Many students are affirmative with this action, whereas there are many students criticize it too.

i'am going to support highly this idea by making them aware of its importance.        ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0

The difference about the two is art classes and electives how they would set a skills some sudents have good skills in drawing or writing it will take student time on school work than outside job that they working on; Art classes are hands on class is for students who wants advanced skills in writing or any type of work or job related to technology or language skills, good scholarship and art classes not for students who procastinate than doing their work. As My i would prefer elective classes because it doesnt get my school work on my path and I have to complete it. elective class helps students who doesnt have time to do their work also benfit any students to have jobs outside of schools. Some students in elective class can have the same credits for graduation same as the art class but more students would rather have elective beacue ii is much more relax than getting alot of class work in front;

4906FE42D823,"Philosopher Albert Schweitzer once said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" meaning setting a good example by your own behavior to influence other people. Some say setting a good example is the best way for one to influence others, on the other hand, there are better ways to influence others. The best ways to influence other is to show motivation and to be positive in what is being accomplished.

Motivation is a major aspect to those trying to reach or accomplish a certain goal. For example, a person is trying to lose weight and be in better shape to do or a sport in school, but that person isn't feeling motivated to do anything, with even a little motivation by saying ""it's going to be tough at the start, but once you feel like giving up ask yourself why you started"" can get that person moving and determined to reach the goal that's being aimed for. Not only is Motivation a huge impact in influencing other, Being positive is a major key to get others moving.

Being positive can affect others in a way to get them more influenced. For example, a person is trying to write a song but just can't seem to figure out what or how to write it, stress and anger is taking over but showing the positive can allow that person to relax and have a clear mind on knowing what to write about. Being positive can easily affect those that are around and by saying, thinking, and listening to positive things is can influence so many others.

There are millions of other ways to influence people, and it most certainly is the best way to do so. Motivation and being positive can indeed help those who need the influence, even when they can't reach their goal or can't be able to write a certain song, these following reasons have showed how it can help and many more can be done to influence others.",2.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0
491FA41A1499,"What are some good attitudes you can show it to your friends. I saw people have good attitudes in their way like one of my friend. If people have good attitudes that doesn't mean they don't have attitudes. Having good attitudes mean they have attitudes in a good way. My friend showed attitudes to different people in a different way. You can tell when people have bad attitudes or good attitudes. The good attitudes helps you to success in your life even when you have difficult time. The benefits of have good attitudes is you can success in your life, be happy, and have friends.

You can only success in your life by getting support from your family and your friends. Most of the people show their attitudes at school like one of my friend does. She never showed bad attitudes with her teacher or other adults but she does show attitudes with her friends but not bad way. She showed bad attitudes some time and good attitudes sometime. She think its fun because we are all same. She don't feel bad when she show us attitudes. She knows we are not going to feel bad for that. We all will help her out when she needed.

Like I said you can success in your life by getting support from you friends. If she have fake friends she knows they never will help her when she needed.

Be happy, I mean that by getting good grades at school. If you get good grades that mean everyone happy even your teacher. My friend, she always try to get our help before she ask her teacher. Is not that she is bad at school. Everyone get confused at something. I saw lots of difficult time at her life and we all tried to help. If she wasn't being kind to us no one would of friend with her. Also one time a teacher tried to help her to get good grades at class. She had C+ at class she needed only some point to get B- so that she can get A B honor roll. She request her teacher if she can help her out with it ,and her teacher gave extra point on test she took. Her teacher told her 'I only did that because you are a kind person.' 'I will love to help someone like you.'

Its not easy to make friends. Some people like to have friends who is kind to them, have good attitudes, have some similarities between each other. Some people make friends who has bad attitudes like them. They think talking with a nice person is embarrassing. Some people like having a good friends who never will leave them behind. If you make a friend who have bad attitudes all the time that means she/he is your fake friends. Also, a kind person can be also a fake friend. For example, when I moved into a new school I had friend. She always helped me. She was really polite to me. She helped me to find my classes, she helped me make new friends because I was a shy person. After some days letter there was a another girl moved in there. After that girl moved int here she never talked me. I tried to go talk to her but she didn't really care. Sometime when I saw her in the hall I said ""hi"" and she also said it back. After while she never even look at me. Its like she don't even know who I am. So yeah, its hard to find friend who really care about you.

In conclusions, some good attitudes you show it to your friends is be with them when they need you the most, be polite to them. Having good attitudes can help people future a lot. You have to explore that good attitudes. Some people don't even know what is good attitudes mean. They think attitudes is attitudes, they think having attitudes mean being really mean to people. But there is so many way to show attitudes, good way and bad way. Good attitudes helps people to success in their life. In additional, to success in life you also need your family and friends help.

4A38761A2CBB,"I agree on Prime Minister Churchilll quote that ""success consist of failure,being successful"" can be a different of what people might think and solving their problem to overcome any challenges that blocking their ways to being to improve and motivate them selves as a person.

Success is not just a dream is a dedication to be engage in everyday activity also success also a role for humans to think whats ahead and not lookig back to seek old habits.

Failure doesn't mean just to give up dreams and ideas but it gives the choice of pushing it to the limits and overcome any challenges,failure can also help to motivate any hopesand being prepared for any challenge thats around. its like how to motivate others to support and encourage them to help what their need is.

Despite having failure its not a end of the world situation but a test for confidence,skills and improvement or being a leader of some sort of ideas and real life. its like My self taking a test i was more likely to be more nervous but i was really confident that i would pass my class than thinking of failing it. some people want to be successful to persue the happiness and they dont the others to help get on track as their skills improves and its crucial for them to think futher down the road whats their future going to be and some people doesn't want to loose enthusiam its like loosing a video game and gave up easily and just throw the console to the trash and never play again for the rest.

but some people want challenges becase they can think hard and improve and know their weakness as they progress every level and they dont want to get beaten they want to stay on the top.

4B0F6070B45A,"Every day all the people in the world make a lot decisions and each one have different way to decided. Sometimes you have you have to ask for help, becasue there is a lot of people with experienced for example, parents,teachers and experts. I think decisions can affect your future and also can affect other people. Adults, specially old people have a lot advices for you to be a better person.

First of all, decisions are the key of the one person and can affect the future for the rest of the life. For example,education is one of the most important thing in the life, and that's why your parents always keep saying go to school, and finish the high school that advice is given to you because they want to see a better future for you and you have to listen because is the experienced that is talk is not your parents.

Second, adults have a lot of experience specially old people (grandmother and grandparent).For example, every time when your parents talk for your future, they know about the life because all they have experienced and maybe when they were young, make a bad decisions and that's why the given to you a lot advices because they worried about you.

Finally, most of the time specially (young girls and boys) when they decided something always is wrong because they only care they self but that decisions can affect other people. For expample I from Generic_City and in my country all the time you see young people make the decision to drop out of school and get to the gangs. As a result, they get to the jail or they died and the only people who cry is your family bacuse they want all the best for you.

In conclusion make decisions is not easy for each one because some are easily and some are hard, but I think you shoot ask all the time first for help with your parents and with experts because they have a lot experienced.        ",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0
4B6DF39107CC,"Is it a good idea to graduate high school in three years instead of additional four year? Based on my experiance in high school, i disagree with students who graduate high school in three years, besause students can take college credits while they have short schedual on their senior year, and also they can get into the clubs that would give them the idea of that they would do after the graduations. In order to graduate high school in three years students must take summer school, give up on their elective courses, and give up on their vacations.

Students have to take three years of summer school in order to graduate high school early. They are required to complete all the credits that is neccessary for graduations. They must complete the requirements for graduation before it is too late. If the students chooes to skip one year of summer school credit they cannot graduate in three years, and they will have rough time trying to cought up. If they still got lazy than there is no other way to graduate then four years plan. This is where their whole stuggles end up, and they still have to be in school for the fourth year.

Students have to give up on their electives during their high school year to graduate. They will have full schedual of requirements to finish up. They have to work hard, do all the work for all of their classes, turn in almost every homework for their classes. They will be struggling during school year since they do not have an elective class that they will be not hard to think about, also some schools offers courses that would give students the ideas for their college life, such as Generic_School. It is an engineering courses that give the students idea of what they would do if they want to be an engineer.

Students will give up on their summer vocations because they will be taking summer school to graduate high school in three years instead of additional four year. However students will be doing their school stuff while others will be celebrating their vocations. Students who want to finish up their schools early, they will be attending summer schools. Becide it they also be working, and maybe they wonld not have time to complete their assignments on time, it will make them to change their opinnoin on early graduation, they will give up on their early graduation plan.

To conclude, it is not the best choice to graduate high school in three years, additionally students would have rough and tamble time trying to finish high school. Therefore, it will be better if they stick with a normal school time and finish high school in four years, it will help them to get more knowledge, and better undrestainding of that they would do for their oncoming life. For the majority of people its better to graduate high school in four years, even though if they are aiming for advance deploma they will need to take full four years of high school, and summer school as well, but if the students are going for standard deploma they will have short schedual, and they can take advantage if it and take college credits for free on their senior year.

4BA9296EBE9F,"A topic that is debated is if students should do online classes. Some people believe that there should be online classes. They believe that there should be online classes because the students can take there time and feel comfortable where they are . I belive that we shouldn't have online classes because student can ask for help when they need it, Students are better when they work together as a team and you can get extra help after school and before school .

Students can ask for help. Teacher can help students when they don't understand something instead of trying to look it up on the internet .Students don't learn from the internet or they will just forget. Online classes is good but what if the students doesn't understand then they would just stay confused. The teacher can show them in person then in a computer screen. If students did online classes what if they don't understand there work because they can't just call there teacher sometimes they don't answer.

Students work better when they work together. Group projects can help them in the future when they got to work with other people. They can learn from each other and there mistakes . When the students are in groups they don't do it solo and they can get the more work done. They get to meet new people that they never ever get to talk to and make new friends. Online classes you just listen to the teacher and ask question do the same thing but can never work with other people.

There extra help after and before school. Online classes there no before or after school it just the time of your classes. In School the teacher stay after or come before school to help students with their work or the ones that just doesn't understand . The Teacher helps them with homework so they don't have to do it at home and the same with classwork if they don't get it done there after school. There also people who have to do stuff after school so there is before school where they can come early and do there workk.

I believe that we shouln't have Online classes because student can ask question,student have more fun doing group activity and if the students need help they have after and before school to get extra help.

Online classes isn't really necessary it wouldn't effect anything.

First, when we are accomplish something we need to be proud of yourself , it is wonderful when other people are getting done their goals.

Second, we may not believe on what other people said to you because sometimes you are right but if you pay attention you can go down with your goals, that why you have to finish your accomplish alone.

Also, when we done something we feel very happy and that can help us to follow what we actually need to be a great people.

For example: if we are idle we never can be great on our future, we need to know and be sure that if we do not follow our dream, it can not come true, like when you are in the college and you said i need to be a nurse or something like that you have to go to the college every single day and stay strong for all that you are making and when you done, you will see your that dream come true and them you can see all the effort that you did.

In conclusion: we need to know that everything can be possible and be sure what we are doing because is the only way to stay strong and not down of everything because we need to be proud of yourself and not be selfish with other people because of anyway everbody need to have the same right, we need to feel happy about what other people is doing, because on the end you can see your effort and your dream come true!",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0

And when we do that, the only one who will get hurt is us, if we are and behave exactly as we are may be there won't be too much people around us but that is not the most important accomplish, the most important accomplish is when we learn how to love our self and be who we are no matter if there won't be a lot of people surround us, if someone will loves me it has to love me for who I am not for who I pretended to be.

Everyone in this world deserve to be love for who they are, no one needs to be someone else to be love or accepted , we have to stop trying to be someone else just to fit with a group of people because if you're not like them, then that's means that you don't belong to that place. Been who we are is what makes us special, there are no specifics forms that forces you how to be, pretending it won't make you happy. Just will make you feel that you don't deserve to be love, it will make feel desolate, it will make you feel that you are not funny as the rest of your friends. But when we learn how to be our self in this world where it constantly triying to make us feel or be someone else it is the greatest accomplishment, because when we know how love our self for who we are and how we look then we will be capable to love someone else for who they are not for who they pretend to be.

Feeling like you don't deserve to be in this world is not the best feeling sometimes all you wanted to do is just go to a place where nobody knows you, where you want to start over again and do what you really love, be who you are and if someone gets to knows you it will accept you the way you are but something that we can't see is that we don't actually needs to go to the other side of the world to start over because we can try to start with our self, we have to start loving us the way we are. Why do you think that sometimes we feel desolate too? Do you think that is because we are been honest we our self? It is important to ask our self that question because it makes us think about our self for a minute and forget about the rest of the people about what they would think of me, most of the time we forgot about our owns feeling about how we gonna feel at the end if we do or behave the way that the society is asking us to do. And when we forget about our self that is the time when we feel desolate, and what can fill that what we think is missing? Is learn how to be our selves. If you're not funny as they want you to be or they might say that you have to be like the rest, that's not right because you will make yourself to a side and you will start been someone who's not you, someone you don't love but you have to be that way so you can be accepted and when that happen you are losing the greatest thing you have inside of you to give... Been who we are maybe it won't makes us see the perfect person in the world but it will make you happy to know that you have accomplish the greatest goal! Which is to be yourself in a world that always wants you to be someone else. Now that I had learn how to love myself I'm able to see that everyone deserve a change to be themselves, to show what they have, learn how to be you it also help you to see the beauty in the rest of the people that is surround you it also makes you free to stop thinking that they need certain things to be love or accept.

Elementary students should need to know what will go on in middle school and it's expectations. So explaining it will make it easier for sixth grade students.

once coming to middle school

First of all, students should know about the class room expectations. Middle school student should be respectful, responsible, and productive. Kids should know better than to play around ,or ignore teachers and ignore their work. Students should come to school ready to learn not to play around. Kids should be quiet while a teacher is talking and should also be silent while taking a test or quiz. They shouldn't be throwing stuff around the room or be yelling or screaming. When i used to talk i would get in trouble but, i would always listen to the teacher.

Second of all, students should know about halls and lockers expectations. While walking in the halls kids should be safe. Students should not run in the halls and, should not push and shove other kids. Because students could get injured. At your lockers you should get your things for the next class and not talk to your friends in the hallways. If you cant open you locker ask a teacher near by. But you shouldn't kick your locker. If i couldn't get my locker open i would just ask a teacher to help me. Don't kick or slam you locker respect the schools things because it provides you with the things you need to learn with.

Last but not least, you must know the lunch expectations. During in line to get your lunch you shouldn't be touching everything nor, keep a hold up in the line. Be productive and get your lunch fast then take a seat at you table. If you need anything raise your hand dont get up with out permission. Don't throw food at people pick up your trash once you leave and, dont make a mess. While eating you should stay in you own seat and not at others tables. Once i would go to lunch i would get my food fast then take a seat with my friends at my table. In the cafeteria it is super loud so try not to scream or yell because it will be extra louder if you do.

In conclusion this is why teaching kids about middle school is a good lesson to teach elementary school students. So that once they go to middle school they would be ready. The students would already know most of the school expectations and how things work around.",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0

Most of the students are preparing for good colleges and some of the colleges you have to stay so many years to finish them. and also from my experinse it is hard enough as it as in four years but i know so many students have done it before and they sucssed on it. and i know some student have done it too but in 2.5 years. and i almost have done it and it have been good for me but it need alot of work and you have to study hard and foucces in your school and do your homwork and get good grades and don't do any pronlems in school becasue if you did any thing wrong you are going to stay more years at the school.

it is good to graduate early whenn you are young so you will have alot of years in college to be a heigher education. at the end i would say and support every one that want to graduate early because it is good for their future and i have to say thank you for the people that they are helping me to do that.

People should believe that the true self esteem of students are absolutely coming from the achievement only. Because of praising students in a long times, it migt be would make them image anything that they want to do is all for other's praise to them. Also, the achivement of students are only come when they can be self confident to face any hard works. The praise given is something that cannot be stay in one person foever, praise is to support students spirit while they become successful.

First of all, praising students in a long times, it might be would make them think of anything that they want to do is all for other's praise to them. Because students can easily get distracted by praising from others, they could not be focus to be themselves when there's too much praises for them. Students need to remember that people may give praise to bring them up and surely can bring them down anytime. So, students do not need to listen to anybody's praise or anything that is unreal. Otherwise,a better way is students should be believing in themselves that they can do well on anything hard works.

Secondly, the achivement of students are only come when they can be self confident to face any hard works. Students should learn how to handle any hard works when they go out to the real life. They need to facing to real things, real problems and that is how they can be true self esteem. They can't be afraid or lose their spirit whenever they fail. Also, students can be achivement while they know exactly what they should do to reach their goal on the future. Student better know that people only remember to them when they become success, but if they aren't no will care about them.

Finally, the praise given is something that cannot be stay in one person foever, praise is to support students spirit while they become successful. Because the praise from others to them can easily forget very quickly. So students should know the goods and bads of the praise, it could bring students to more success when they know that the praise of people can helps. Students can be famous and getting praising from others anytime when they do something great or they can show people about how well their capability are.

The achivement of people are not coming from anyone's praise, that is about how hard they were try and what were they faced to reach their goal. Also only believing in themselves could bring them to the successful in future. There are nobody can help or follow them until the end of your goal, so they should do their best they can to show their ability. ",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5
50611B996992,"During this time our society are magnifying in many ways. Therefore, people has to work, study, or do any personal things every day. People don't conseve their energy and resources in the way that people get tired daily. Nonetheless, there are some businesses had the idea to work four days per week each day consistenting of ten hours. As well as, schools should follow this project by extending the school day two hours. In my opinion, school should follow this great idea because students can do differents routine, be less stressful, and get better grades.

To begin with, the majority of students do the same rutine daily some enjoy to play sports on the school. Whereas, someone will like to try another kind of sport outside the school but they don't have sufficient time to do it. Elsewhere, if the school follow extending the school day and leaving one or two days off students can do different rutine and have thier own space. All in all, students can try different sports with their families or friends outside of school. In others words, doing differents routine will help the energy and resources for students.

Second reason, for some students is stressful go to school everyday. As well as, some has to work to late, or do homework, or has problent to get sleep at night. If this happend during this time they loss their energy and is difficult for student to focus on their class. However, students that are stressful can have health problem. In other case, students can be less stressful and active if their sleep more such as, if they get two days off of the school they can repose their tiredness and get energy.

Lastly, the energy and resources are a important priority for a student. Likewise, that all students do their homework and be on time in their class. nevertheless, the majority of the students has problem be on time or do homework some of them miss school days just because they didn't do their homework. Altogether, durin this days off students can do their homework with resources, patience and dedication. After all, this could help student to have better grades.

To conclude, the priority for people life is to conserve energy and resouces. Rather, we are on time to help our students's health. Lately, doing different rutine will help us to progress and be healthy. If we are healthy we are less stressful we will be with energy. After all, energy, time, and resources are the key to be successful.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
506A69171959,"Do you have a goal in your life? How can you accomplish to your goal? I think everyone can get a goal, but many people ask, ""how can I get a goal?"" Because they cannot wait until the finish goal line, also they cannot concentrate on their goal. We cannot see the finish line,that is why people always give up in fort of the finish line you are always doing something, then you can do accomplish more. This is three reasons you can do accomplish more if you are always doing something.

First is when you concentrate on one thing and think about that, then you can get a power to get in your goal. Concentrate power is amazing, Every history of the scientists were concentrate one thing and always do something. For example, have you seen the Newton's notes? He always thought and concentrated to gravity and earth. He took notes every seconds and minutes, he never stopped take notes. Today, we learning his notes everyday like Newton's first law, second law, and third law. If you think about it and concentrate one thing, you can closer to your goal.

Second, If you keep going to your goal, you can get into the summit. Whenever you are and whatever you want, if trying to do that, you can make it. For example, David in the Bible, he practiced throw the stone everyday. He never forgot to practice throw the stone, and one day he met an enemy. Everyone thought David will die because David was so small and young, but the enemy was really big and strong. Do you know the end of story? David won the battle because of the stone, he attacked enemy's head. what is the main idea of this story? Throw the stone is really small and tiny thing, but he attacked enemy and saved the nation. If you keep going on any small thing and tiny thing, you can make it and you can make more biggest thing, you could not imagine thing.

Third, you keep dreaming and keep trying to your goal you can get the accomplish to your goal. Keep trying and keep dreaming are really important. If you don't have dream in your life, you can never get that. For example, Aristotle was experiment everyday. Also the result was different everyday, but he keep trying figure out the result. If you gave up that time and stopped challenge, then maybe we don't know who is the Aristotle. Many scientists also said this, keep dreaming is better than not dreaming. Keep dreaming and get more closer to your goal in your dream, get a hope and keep challenge.

Finally,

when you concentrate on one thing and think about that, then you can get a power to get in your goal. Becuase the concentrate power is amazing. Do not give up and keep going to your goal, you can get into the summit. Whenever you are and whatever you want, if trying to do that, you can make it. You keep dreaming and keep trying to your goal you can get the accomplish to your goal. If you want to something to do and something to accomplish, you have to know what is my goal and what should I do for my goal. If you know exact your goal and then always doing this three, you can make it. ",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0

The majority of students that I have asked about it say that working in group has been more succesful for them because in fact it is way faster,you get to share your ideas and support others. Many times that I have worked on something by my self I always wonder about many things or opinions about my work and it is hard for me to check if it is good or what would people think about my work.

It is also benefitial for teachers because students will have less questions for them,so teachers can use that time for grading or other things while the students are working in group. I have seen some teachers having a hard time grading and explaining at the same time because every single student is working by their own.

Teachers must have their students working in a group than alone because as I see it is more benefitial and better,this will have students to come up with better work and they also get to interact with diferent people and learn from them.",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0
510CA49B78BB,"Is setting an example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people? Sometimes it is not the best idea to mirror other people's behavior because some people do not always have a positive behavior. There could be time's that someone could be in a negative place of mind, reckless, and does a lot of horse play; other time's people can be charming, properly mannered, and influential.

Growing up in the Generic_City area, I have been able to witness a lot of drugs, gangs, and violence. The example these group of people decide to display is not a very positive act on their behalf; this is not a pathway you would want to be taking because of the bad outcomes from it. I remember I had a friend who's father shot himself due to the poor choice he made which made him reflect and he figured that was the only solution.

On the other hand, some people decide to be very influential to society in a positive manner. Out of my three years of high school I was able to see some students making their way for others by not being selfish; a lot of them did volunteer work as well to help the community and to hopefully inspire others to do so as well. I actually got the opportunity to throw a kids halloween party at a church: I enjoyed it, it was a lot of fun.

Honestly, I do not feel like I am a good example nor do I feel like I am a bad one either. I make mistakes: it is how I was taught. Growing up I believed that the only way you are ever going to learn is by making mistakes and being able to evaluate the error of your mistake; only then you can truly improve yourself and help insipre other people as well.

In conclusion, I am mutual about examples being the best way to influence other people because of it not always being a positive thing due to the poor decisions some people choose to make. Truthfully I think it is a better idea to be the best you that you can be because at the end of the day there is only one of you and so many of us; it is best to stay unique.",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5

Additionally, people know which is the best decision by themself. The people have the responsability to improve their lifes or not, and the people will assume their own responsability if their decisions are bad.

Some people believed that you always have to try something new everyday, while other believed that they always want to work in something that they always flourished in. Although, doing what they know can make people feel confident but, its salient for us to flourish in our life, because you can learn new things to be successful, you can have more experience, you can also mastered in more things than you are in right now for more opportunity.

First, trying new things can help you to be successful, sometimes you inserted that into your mind that you have never done that thing then,you end up saying that you can't do that, but never ever make that egregious decision in you life unless you never try you never going to know. For Example, a friend of mine named Generic_Name, once said that ""Try Try but don't Cry"" it means that don't ever think that you can't do it, you can and you can do it in better way than anyone else don't ever break your confident because of you nervous or for any other reason, but that's not how it works, you just need to fight through whatever reason you had. A myriad of people thinks that when they don't know what to do they always give up instead of trying, but its salient for all of us to put that confident into your mind. Also sometimes it can erroneous your feeling when nobody going to gives work to you because you never have done that work and also you refused to do it.

Moreover, it is important for you to have more experience of everything than you have in order to flourish. Experience can make such a difference in what you have learn because it can prepares you from the beginning, so then you can't struggle any more in future, it can be harder at the beginning for some people, but it will get way more easier as you work through it in future. For Example, a student at Generic_school named Generic_Name had said that ""if I take classes that related to my career in high school it can make myself to be prepare for career in future."" It means that he can have a myriad of experience in high school since, he is a flourishing student, also he can learn and experience things very quickly, so then its easy for him when he'll going to enter into his own career field. He'll not going to have that much trouble of being in that field like now a days other people have, and also He'll not going to be full of experience when he will go their or how it works, but he can learn basic things that he suppose to have in order to be in that career field.

Lastly, you can mastered more than you are right now. If you mastered more their are more opportunity for you to get more scholarships. Scholarships can help you to graduated from high school with more credits and their are more chances for you to get accepted in collages. you can get to the collage that you really want to go into. There are myriad of collages that want you to be more intelligent and have mastered in everything because that's what they stand for since, it higher level of education they need, so its hard if you don't mastered more its not always like how you think that that's going happened sometime collages look for some staff that you never good at, so its important for all of us always be active. Its not fun to mastered more but sometimes you just have to make fun by working hard and putting you best effort into that work.

In Conclusion, it is salient to all of us to be good and stay active in everything that we can, because you never know when that all stuff that you have experience on can help you so we just need to be prepare it can flourish your future life. Its better for you to try flourishing from beginning of everything you have to have little bit of experience about everything it can also open up your future door to get success. For instants job, career and many other things that can help you to grow you experience that's the reason why we have to know or learn everything that is important it can help you to get into a career that can change your life.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.5

523130079501,"""Their are advantages of cell phone usage in class but their even more disadvantages to it."" cell phones aren't great for students to use in classroom because it cause distraction and make students not focus while teachers give instructions. Teenagers get so easily distracted by anything because they are careless and aren't aware. Phones aren't beneficial nor useful. Students should use either school or home laptop it is more beneficial and useful than cell phones and in that ways teachers will be easily find out what they have done in class.

First of all, the reason why cell phones aren't useful for students in classroom for educational purpose it's because of distraction; that will bother the whole class ,and might bother teachers too. Since cell phones are one of the rule to be use in class then all have to follow it. For instance, if teacher assign work for students to do during class on their phones imagine what will be the result nothing might be done by the end. Laptops have big screen so that teachers can follow up with their students. With cell phones is difficult for teachers to know weather or not the student have done something in class. Students have good tricks especially teenagers. They might be acting like they are working but truly they are messaging ,and once the teacher approach he/she change the page so they can show evidence that they are working. Teachers are even smarter they know how to deal with students like this. They either sit with them to help them out or ask to come after school if they really struggle and can't do nothing.

In this situation is a good idea for teachers to collect phone before class starts and hand them back by the end. Any advice could be more useful then cell phone. That is also the reason why cell phones aren't beneficial.

Additionally, cell phones aren't always beneficial the reason why is because it distract easily. It cause problems between students. For example, if their are two students playing soccer on their phone how will they focus; they can't control themselves one shout happy scores ,and the one who lost want to beat the other guy who win and so on. Cell phones shouldn't be use at all in class but only with teachers permission. It will be even better if two teachers help out in the class with work. They both will help students pay attention and participate. Both together will be able to control phones usage. It is hard when you are working on an essay and suddenly a message pop up you can't control yourself ,and you can't focus just because of the message you are carious and really want to know what is happening. That is the reason why cell phones shouldn't be use in class just because of distraction and the impact that might happen to students from using it.

However not everyone agree, some argue that cell phones is great to be use in schools for educational purposes. First think about the disadvantage that could happen with this use or rule. Think about others and how that might effect them. Will you be able to control yourself if you receive a text from a friend?. In fact, there are many things that might cause distraction but one of the biggest distraction are cell phones ,however, any other things can be control. Any other device will be okay because it will easy to be seen by teachers. Cell phones won't help you at all however it will bring your grades down and it will bother you. Not everyone have same opinion other have positive view on the use of cell phones. Which is okay but think about it more. Look to it's positive and negative impact on students and you fill find the answer.

Why most students will agree with the use of cell phone in class?. Some student aren't always aware of what they are doing and they are careless. They think messaging or whatever they are doing in class is more important then their grades. Students should avoid all distraction such as food, cell phones, and music to help our society develop.

If all students focus and pay attention that will have a huge impact on the environment.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5

You learn from your experiences because your action, words you use or say, and your appearance can show exactly who you are. People agree with this statement because you can change your appearance, words you used and your actions.

First of all, when you meet someone for the first time the way you act is important. Due to the fact that your actions speak louder than words is true. Your actions are things you can not change from your first impressions. When you start to act in front of somebody you just met, do not be mean or rude to them.

If you do that they will think you are not a good person to be around. You need to make sure you do not mess up the first time.

When you speak to someone you just met do not use bad words because if you do they will think you do not know how to talk to someone. When you talk ,you can use big words or just talk normal because no matter how many times you talk well to them you are gaining their trust. Make sure you do not mess up or stutter a lot I know you may stutter but you can always try your best not to stutter so much. If you mess up some people are nice enough to give you a second chance. Make sure you do not talk with your hands when you meet someone new.

In addition your appearance is the most important thing of first impressions. Your appearance is something you can not change. Your appearance is the way you look on the outside and inside . People always focus on people appearance the way you act and the words you say but mostly on your appearance. When you have a bad appearance they will think you are bad person and they will not want to be friends with you. If you have good appearance they might like to be friends with you, but it depends on their first impressions too.

If you like the way they act or the they talk or most of all their appearance. If their first impressions was good then you might want to be friends with them. Your first impressions are impossible to get out of your head and also impossible to change.

On the other hand you might be able to change people's minds. Some days you can have a bad day and other days you might have a good day. Some people appect that you are having a bad day and they know you are not like that. However, no matter what happens to you there is always a second chance at first impressions.

To sum up some people say that your first impressions are impossible to change and people agree with that. The important things are your actions, words, and your appearance.

54304ACFE477,"when we're born we come out of our mothers womb, the first thing we naturally do is screech and cry, and if we dont cry the doctor hits us on our backs and try's to make us cry. And from that cry on we develop our own kind of sound and our own screech with its own pitch. They take our fingerprints where there will never be two of the same, even when were born with our twin it will never be the same no matter how much alike we are. from there on we start to learn and develop our own persona. After were born our brain starts to function even with little stuff, babies learn to cry when they're hungry, want to be changed, when theyre in pain or simply want attention. When children get older into the toddler stage they start to learn how to walk by observing everyone else they learn to talk by listening to everyone else around them. We learn how to grab our bottle, pick up a fork or spoon, and practically our own daily doings. But we learn all that from observing and listening to everyone else. When we hit our 6-12 years of age where we have a tendency that we want to fit in be in the cool kids group and we watch TV see celebrity's see that there are musicians, actors, painters, policeman, firemen, dentist, doctors, mayors chefs, soccer players, basketball players, football players, baseball players, hockey players, tennis players, volleyball players etc the list could go on and on, but the point here is the fact that we influences. But as we get older in our teen years 13-19 we start to have our own kind of voice at least until were old enough to make them, we all take our own paths and we choose to make the decisions that we make, our parents dont go with us throughout the day telling us what to do or not do making our each and every decision for us, they sure do give us a hell of advice because they already went threw that stage and they dont want to see fail and get hurt but sometimes its good that we fail and make mistakes because then we learn what we can or cannot do. Now as you turn into an adult that net that we used to have when we were living under mom and dads roof is no longer there its gone we dont have that privilege anymore, and we need to grow up and create and develop our own persona officially. when you get a job it comes with responsibilities and from there we learn if were responsible or irresponsible, if were social or non social if were lenient of non lenient, patient or impatient, forgiving or unforgiving. Id like to think that were all born to grow and learn about our rugged society, and based on what we've lived is how were going to act because we can literally live in a shit hole of a place and have the happiest attitude ever and have a better attitude then a boy or girl complaining that she didnt get the car she wanted, verses the kid that saw his mother get beat by his dead beat dad or the kid that was up all night wondering if his mom was going to come home tonight or even the kid that went to sleep hungry. So honestly i don't think that were born with labels i feel like we all can make our own decisions of what were going to make of life, if you'r going to sit there and make everyone see you as a pity. A huge play of your character is your mentality is you have a broken done weak mindset your going to have negative vibes and weak dead beat character, but if you have a strong mindset and the will to get stuff done then youll have a broad and respected character. In conclusion id like to think that we create and build our own character and and that were not given a label by any higher power of what our character is going to be in life.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5

This is important because you don't need money to be happy in your life just live your life with people the make you feel good and don't try to make you feel sad or bad.

In your life Don't follow nobody and don't trust no one just your self. For example do somethiing the you like and you need think about the you are better the everyone because some people in this life are jealousy and something they can break you dream and you can not follow your dream because he say someting the make you sad or he do someting to you the you feel the with the thing the he did you can stop follow your dream. This is important because Don't live somebody also your life and don't make someone also control and tell you what you need to do with your life.

Everyday I

think about world can be if everyone are able or think to help the next youth. For example one day I was in Italy I was going to the super market with my dad and i think was my friend too with I don't know wherever, we going t obuy all the food the we need and when going to the register to pay what we buy I saw a guy try to buy a sandwich but he tell the register the only money the he have was $0.50 cent the sandwich was i think $2 then when i saw him turn the sandwich back to the register I take the sandwich and I buy for him, he was so happy and he tell me,"" My friend you make my day better"" i was so happy that day. This is important because you don't need spend a lot of money to make someone happy.

In conclusion I think we are complish more when we always do something for somebody and I want say to everone the to live your life and never give up, because the time the you give up iss when you not trust your self anymore and that's is not a good thing.

one is if you have a goals trough the year something that you want to accomplish or you have a dream you must start to take a step by step reviewing it every single day saying to your'e self I can do it even though when no body see you're work no matter how long it will take , but eventually you will get to that point where you want to be as long as you tying you're best every day, and you will be successful in life.

A lot of people want to accomplish their goals, but the thing is they don't actually take action why because they afraid of fielder you can always win, but you can be the best as you could be, and you never be same again because you come this way if you don't do something every day you're life will never change.

5564D9D8C845,"""Studies have shown that one way to improve student achievement is to start an after school homework club."" Two-thirds of the students who join an after school activity club are more likely to succeed in academics then students who do not. Schools should establish an after school homework club because it can help students finish their homework, become more socially interactive , and give students some teaching experience.

Firstly, an after school homework club helps students finish their homework in time. Many student get a low grade in their class because of unfinished homework. They were not able to finish their homework because, they did not know how to do it. Teachers do not usually have the time to go through each student, and help them in class, but some teachers volunteer to meet with students who have difficulty in certain subjects in an after school homework club. Joining an after school homework club is a great way to finish your homework in time. Sometimes teacher might even give students some tips and tricks on how to solve a question, that they would not give out in class. My friend Generic_Name used to have a lot of difficulties with his math homework until he joined the after school homework club in our school. He learned many tricks on how to solve a math equation and even taught a trick to solve an ""Integer Slope Inequality"" equation.

Moving on, an after school homework club can help students become more socially interactive. While in an after school homework club, you can find students with the same difficulties as you. This will give students something to relate to and not feel out of place. Having group discussions on how to solve a problem and having group projects in your club will also help you be more socially interactive. My friend Generic_Name made many friends by joining the after school homework club in our school, and grew a lot of confidence. He is now much less nervous when talking to people than before.

Lastly, homework clubs can give students teaching experience for if they want to be a teacher when they grow up. Students can volunteer to help other students finish their homework in an after school homework club. This will give the student a lot of experience on how to teach, and deal with other students. There is a team of students is our school called the "" Junior Honor Society"", which helps students with academic difficulties every day after school. As a member, I have learned about a lot of ways to teach someone else, and because of my desire to be a teacher one day, this helps me a lot.

Schools should establish homework clubs because it can help students finish their homework, become more socially interactive , and can give students teaching experience.

55C7EC027A88,"Lately many people have said students should have a shorter summer vacation about 45% of people have. They think it would be better for students so they don't forget what they learn the year before when the come back in the fall. They think students should have year-round schools, but is that a really good idea? Well here are many reasons why there shouldn't and why it would be a horrible idea. Many people think that students shouldn't have to year-round schools because the students might have a summer job, It's no enough time, they shouldn't have to worry school for that long, and it's just too many things for them to remember.

Many students normally middle schoolers and high schoolers have to work during the summer. Many students have to work after school and it's just to much for them. Some might work because the need to help their families with money, others to buy something they really want or need, and some is so when they get out of high school and they can have enough money to get into collage. Whatever the reason may be they need the three month summer vacation so they can have more money to do whatever they need with it and have a year-round school will not help them because after work they need to do homework. About 85% of students that work and have go to go school will have to stay up really late so they can do thier homework. Students often do not get enough sleep. They stay up late night hours doing homework , project or studying. In reality it's just too much work for students to keep up with school for that long.

A three to four weeks for summer vacation is just not enough for students, not even teachers. They deserve a longer summer vacation after all the hard work they have done for those nine months, the least they could get is a three month vacation. They just need to relax and take care of themselves because they sometimes be stressing out too much. Which that could lead to bad health and many other problems. They need a longer vacation because three to four week is not enough. What if they want to travel they can't not for long so they can't really enjoy it. They also need to spend more time with their families, many just don't be as close to them because they are too focus in school. They just a well needed vacation of no more stress for three months.

Another reason why a year-round school is not the greatest idea is that it's just too much for students and teachers to remember. Students already need to remember a lot to pass the SOL. Having a year of school will just keep adding too that. It's also a lot of work for students to be doing. A lot of worksheets, tests, quizes, projects, and for teachers too they need to be planning the next class and need to be grading a lot of papers. Plus another thing to think of is what about summer school? For the students that didn't pass the SOL or the class. When or how will they have the time to pass? There's a lot of things that should be planned out first.

On the other hand I get why it would be nice to be in a year-round school. Students wouldn't forget as much things. Normally when students come back in the fall they are clue-less of what the learned three months ago. A year-round school will decrease that. Students would also get to see their friends more. Often many students don't get to see their friends during summer vacation. For the students that need it, they could get extra help. Also for the students that really like to learn new things this would be a great time too.

However even though all that would be kind of nice. We don't know if the decrease of students forgetting things will actually work because not many students even touch their backpack during any vacation so they would most likely will forget a lot of things either ways. Nowdays even though students might not see their friends. They still manage to text or facetime. Maybe some students might have a car and will be able to go vist them or hang out for a bit. If students need extra help they can get a tourter for that extra help that they may need and if we have a year-round school for them it wouldn't be fair for the other students that do not need that extra help. If they really want to learn new things they can go to classes somewhere for whatever they would like to learn. It's just more better having a three month break.

That's why there shouldn't have a year-round school there just wouldn't be much of benefits. It'll most likey stay with the same problems or even worse. That's why there should be a year-round school because students might have a job, it's not enough time for them, they shouldn't have to worry about school for that long, and they just would have to remember too many things.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0
57A6B1103088,"Classes Online At Home

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Some people think it is good idea to take classes online. They say they have more time to do they homework. Some people think that take classes online is more easy than going to school. But I think that is more difficult because nobody explain you the thing. If people take classes online they will be not learning nothing. In my opinion it's not good idea because people need help from teachers, some people like to come to school, and they like to distract at school.

Some people like to do they work by they self, but others people need help from teachers. For example my sister always stay after school for help from teachers. She said that they help her with the things she do not know about her classes. She said that she learn too much about her teachers, and she like to come to school because the teachers explain the work. For example when she fail a test she stay after school with the teacher, they review about the test, and she learn more. The teachers find the way to help students after school. The teachers have others things to do but they don't care because they want the students to pass their classes.

Some students like to come to school because they make friends and have fun. For example my brother Generic_Name like to play sports at school. He said that play at school it's fun because he talk with other people. School it's important because we have to know about other people and learn more about what is hapen at school. People have the opportunity to come to school everyday and learn. However, In my opinion is important to come to school because when you graduate you going to be happy with your diploma.

Others might say that classes online is good because they like to work lonely. The school distract people from their houses. Some people need distract and also need socialism with friends. At school is the place that people like and feel safe. For example my friend say that she get distract in school she play a sport, or do a activity with others friends. Also the best way to get distract is to speak with adults people that know more about life. Also distract is doing your homework and listen to music.

In conclution, the teachers help students and they explain the things that the students do not know and online they have to do by they self. Come to school is the best way to learn what you want with your life and want you want to became in your future. School have many distract like games, books that you can read and take home. I think students should come to school and not take classes online. The teachers are the best because they help to much the students. Also they are good persons because explain when you don't know nothing. School is important in life because you need a good education and go to college to have a good work in your future.                               ",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
57A750437C3A,"Ralph Waldo Emerson who wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greastest accomplishment"" I agree because if you do everything by yourself better things happens. Like how he saids be yourself can make you better by trying new things, so many reasons to be your own.

First of all, to be yourself can make you great life or more better can open new opportunities, by saying this a refer to get ideology with a great future. A example, making yourself with rules or putting time for something you want to do can be awesome way to start, someone told me if you fight for dreams and you really want to do it, you will get it by doing yourself. Then you can be proud of yourself by doing something the you never imaginate to do it.

Second of all, when you get staff done by your own can be a great example for so many kids in this world. Believe or not be an example for someone is the most accomplisment beacuase they want to do or be like you. Also by trying everyday something new can make you better. How this quote says "" Hard work beat talents when talents doesn't work hard"". Something useful is everyone learn new things by mistakes. Make mistakes is not a big problem, making a mistake means the you are trying to do it better and be better by learning how do it.

Third of all, the last but not least frienships have a lot with this, one question very important in here is How can I be sure the my friends are real?. Yes, probably that can be a problem that's why be yourself is the greastest accomplishment because friends can take you down with drugs, alcohol and bads things. That's doesn't mean the you can not have friends. That means you have to choose really well your friends because hypocristy exist maybe they want you down without future and great life. Hypocristy is the most danger thing in the world by hypocristy you can make people think about how they want to be or what they want to do.

In conclusion, doing yourself can make you better and open opportunites the you never imaginate. Try to do something the you love or like that's a good way to start to be yourself. Choosing what's good for you or what not and remember always fight for your dreams. ",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
57ED5BC70E40,"Dear Generic_Name

I believe that working in a group is way better than working by yourself, get to do less work than working alone .

Working with a group is more beneficial than working alone because when your working alone and you need help there's no one to help you,but when your in a group you get all the help you need.

When i work by myself i usually dont get my work completed. Sometimes i be wondering what are we supposed to be doing. However working by yourself in cress your chances of staying focused and productive. Although you got a better chances of getting a good grade when you work in a group. It all depends on the group if they like to work with each other. Also you could easily get distracted by your own group mates ,but the all depends on the group and the communication they have with each others.

My final reason is that working in a group is better than working alone you get your work done faster than you usually would have alone. There for working in a group has more beneficial like make new friends and new people. ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5
597D76A3BF40,"I would like to start of this topic with a important question that no human being really thinks about, ""How is technology impacting our health?"" That is one of the most important questions that we can't leave unanswered.

The use of technology have rooted in our lives, from the moment we wake up till the moment we go to bed we have hundreds of interaction with various devices, software programs, and tools. Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having any contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to any other person. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had negative effects on people's lives.

While one might think that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive effects on people's lives, others might think that the lack of human contact due to the use of technology had negative effects on people's lives which most people agree with.

When comparing two human beings, one human being that always uses technology to do everything, shop, check out books, play games, do homework, and even talk to friends or family members, that person is most likely going to get sick, be in a lot of pain, or even feel depressed sooner then the person that prefers not to use technology at all but instead of using technology they would rather go out to the store to buy a book, go out to the store to shop new clothes, and even instead of calling on the phone to check on a family member they would rather go out and see them in real life. The reason the person that uses technology more is more likely to get sick or be in pain sooner than the other one is because not only computers and devices encourage more sedentary behavior among users but they also frequently lead to poor posture, neck stain, back issues, and hearing loss. This sort of behavior can lead to chronic pain and discomfort that is hard and not really easy to treat.

Now that we have explained and understood this topic a little bit better let's go back to the question that we asked at the beginning, in case some of you guys forgot the question, the question was

""How is technology impacting our health?"" If people really took the time to think about this question that we usually always leave unanswered we would have known that technology isn't impacting our health in any positive way, technology actually makes us stressed, makes our eye vision bad, gives us back pain, hearing loss, and a lot of other negative outcomes. Another reason why people might feel depressed when they use technology a lot, is because they don't really interact with people and dont have any friends since all they do is stay at home and do everything on their device. It's scientifically proved that every human being need at least one or more friends to talk to every time they feel down and don't feel really good about something. That is the reason why most of the people that use technology a lot, sometimes feel depressed and don't really like to interact with other people around them.

In conclusion , technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others and the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had a negative effect on people's life and if people don't learn how to control and manage their time and not use technology every chance they get, our next generation will be exactly the same as this one right now .The sad thing about the limitation of human contact due the use of technology is that there is no turning back at this point we are in a society where technological innovation and progression is the norm; It would take a minor miracle to reverse all this disaster. In order for all of this mess to get better,

people need to start learning about how to balance their time even if they're using technology, otherwise it is only going to get worse and many people will start feeling pain in their back, getting sick, feeling depressed due to the lack of interacting with people and due to the use of technology.

In my opinion it's a good idea to know what menu has every day in the cafeteria, all the student want to know what is the menu every day.

I think the more import thing is change the time of one hour lunch because most the student want to talk with friends, and some student after eat, they want to go to one class room and talk about classes with the teachers.

Another importation thing about price of food, most of students don't have money to buy food because the price of the menu is high, it's good idea put all the price down and the students that don't have to much money can buy, and it's good idea to know what food the cafeteria has every day, for example they has to put a calendar in the fron door of the cafeteria and all the students can see what day has a good food. it's a good idea to change the lunch time, for example my school, I have one hour of lunch and after eat I can go anywhere, but most the time I go to my class room to do homework, or talk with my friends and I can learn more because they talk more about classes, games or friends.

59E62F702421,"Students should be allowed to do that because they want to learn so much from the professions. They want to learn because this could be their future if they want to. Schools should often do it and will affect these students careers. Kids have these types of dreams that they want to do and learn to get into. They often have the right to ask anybody why these things will help students have a good career and a college degree. The main reason is that this can help kids so much and tell their parents what they learn.

The reason why schools should allow to do this so that kids can go to college and when they are done they can do the job forever and they get the emotion inside of them. Learning so much is the only thing that should help students in school to get all the information inside of their head so that can get them where they want to be. Some don't really have a good thing what they want to do when they are trying to think what they want to do in their life, but it can be a hard choice to decide. Things can really get so good when ever we decide what we tell our parents what we want to do for our lives and other people's too. What we think is that when we go out in the world and see what we think about or something that shocks you when you get so surprised about it and you get it in you head and thats what you want to do.

The job that kids want to do when ever they grow up is the only thing they want to do or something else that's more better than the other one. Things can often have many reasons why kids should get jobs and buy their own things so parents don't have waste any more of their money on them. It's a good thing that parents should make kids work for a job to get money and save up to go to college and have a good time. The thing is that schools have the right idea to teach kids what they should and what they should learn about.

But there was even a new updated on a game that he already have, and it was 10 dollars.

some people may argue that making your own decision is good because it make's a operson independent and people don't have to hear other people's opinion. They have a point but how do they know they are making the right choice if they don't try talking to a guidance expert.

Seeking guidance form experts and authorities about life's important matters is important because it's helpful to hear other people's advice.

When speaking to someone who is experienced it makes it easy for people to talk to with out having to worry if the person is going to say the wrong thing. Speaking to a guidance and authorities who is experienced is important when making a decision.

In conclusion when making an important decision its important to talk to a guidance and authorities expert, to reassure what the person is doing is right for them, So that the decision they make does not affect the person in a negative way. It also helps the person grow and it shows them when making choices they don't have to go through it alone.      ",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0
5D4D6519DF94,"Haile G/Selasie, one of the most famous long distance runners of all time, did not pave his way to success because he was born with it. He came from a poor family, and walked a long distance to his school everyday. When he started running, he was not good at all. He worked day and night to get to where he is. And when he speaks about his past, he tells the story of how he failed again and again a lot of times but he never lost his passion for his dream. And now he is one of the richest people in Ethiopia and one of the best record holders of Marathon.

Success is a dream for most and a reality for only a few. When it comes to how success is achieved, it creates a great question in all our minds and that is,""How can I be successful?"". Some say that success is achieved by going through failures without giving up or without losing hope. That is a truly arguable idea and some might think different. But I fully agree with that idea.

The fact that almost all of the masterminds that are known for their creations of the bulb, physics theories, telephone and many more of the things we take for granted at the moment told the story of how they tried and failed many times than they count. And that is one proof of the point that success doesn't come without failure.

There might be some people that argue this point by pointing out that many people have tried and failed and tried again but it didn't help them achieve their dreams. That is a good point but the fact is that failing is not the only thing that determines your success, but failing and not being discouraged is what really counts. If we plan to achieve a goal, we shouldn't lose our excitement for that specific thing we're doing, we should rather be more encouraged to try harder and to find another way to make it work.

For example, when we first built a rocket,it wasn't done in a day or in the first try. Engineers tried to fix the problem in the mechanical part. Scientists tried to see if their calculations was wrong or if the combination of the chemicals didn't work and many others tried to fix it but they failed more than a couple of times. By not giving up though, it was a success at last.

It might not always seem like it but failure leads to success. The main point is not giving up and not losing our enthusiasm. As the saying goes, ""If you fail once, try and try harder"". Never give up on your dreams and don't be discouraged by failure.

5EA76942F5C7,Me as a student think that we should have at least a (C) because most students use sports to express their feeling out. Sometimes if they don't get what they want they will just stop trying; in school work or even homework. But in the other hand some other students will try harder so they can play or do what they love. So a (C) sounds good but a (B) sounds even better; so students like me could try even harder and have a modification to so. So I say to the principal great gob and keep it up. When we are looking back and when we have a great job that we like; we look back to middle school and say thank u for pushing us to max when it came down to doing work THANK YOU.,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0
5EB7A0B134B4,"some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think students would not benefit being able to attend classes from home because they can not be on their telephone and not due what they are spouse to due.

First, they can get distracted, In my position

I Can get distracted went I am at home doing homework i want to wache TV even some time I do not finish my homework because i get a lot distracted. I want to play whit my brothers go out side play soccer and i say just for a little I am to playing with then but a get distracted and i for got the i have to do homework or study for a test. Some time I get distracted by seeing my brother playing video even went they is a lot of noise i get distracted because i want to what is happening or what is going on. I remember one day the I have to finish a test review at home because I do not have time to do it at school I do not finish because I get distracted by brothers. They were making a lot of noise and i could no concentrate because of then. My brothers are the same way as me they can get distracted fully easy and not pay attention on what they doing maybe they star by doing they homework but they do no finish because they get distracted by the TV or the video game.

Second, they can use the telephone some time I get a lot distracted whit my telephone because I away want to be in the telephone. Went i home I just want to be in my telephone and i do not do my homework. I get fully distracted because I want to text whit my friends or playing video games in my telephone and not Du what i suppose to to do. Went I am at home I have all I want my bed my telephone the TV the I forgot the I have to how or study for a quiz or test. Only because I at home and I have all i need some time i do not want to do anything

I get distracted fully easy and more if I have my telephone in front of me because i want to leasing to music or video chat my friend and talk and pay attention on what I suppose to due. Some time my mom tell that I have to stuff in the house so I have to do it even if I am doing homework or studying I have to what she say and then a can kip doing what i was doing. If I have my telephone whit me the only thing i what to do is be in the telephone because it is a easy way to get distracted and not due what you suppose to due.

Some people my say that if students have home school it will be good because some students can get bully at school and they do not want to go back. The is say for then because some the students do not ride the bus the parent have to take then to school and the take a lot of time some time because they have to wait. Even they are going late for work and they do not have tame to take then to school. They may say the if they have school at home they do not have to do all the work by taking then to school. some time a lot of kids get bully at school and it more easy for then do do it by home because they do not have to deal with at school they do to have to be worry what would happen to then the net they or what does people are going to do whit then, But I chose to not have school at because some people can get distracted I not saying the all people have the problem I am just saying the i have the problem they my not have. But I do not like have home school because i want to see my friend graduate whit then have fun some time go to party and now more people have more experience.

In solution, people can do what is best for you if you like do school by home because you do not like people or have personal problem or have i disability that you go it no one is going to say anything. But some time people want to have friends have fun because you are a person the like to be around people that good to. the only thing i am saying chose what is best for you not what is best for other people or what other people think. Make you own decision be proud of you no matter what.",2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.5,3.0
5EE526AB840B,"How can a students learn more from home than attend classes in school?. A student has more benefits if they attend to classes in schools because if the student can not understand a topic or has questions about it, the teacher can not explain by video conferencing as a teacher that can explain face to face an be sure that student understood. My second reason is a student does not have a person who trust or a person to appeal if He/She are passing for any personal or familiar problem. In schools We can find a lot of person as a teachers, counselor, police members, and psychologist to help students. My last reason is a student has to socialize with other students to be prepare for his/her future.

Firstly, if a student can not understand a topic and has questions about it, they can feel more comfortable to ask and said

""I do not understand, can You explain me again?, if they are with the teacher face to face. Generic_Name (My friend's name) decided to take the classes online, in the beginning He was so excited, but after one month He told me that was not a good choice because He does not feel comfortable asking a lot of question about one topic by the computer, and when He not understood something, He just do not said anything to the tacher who is given him classes by video conferencing.

Secondly, in schools we can find many ways to be help if we have any problem in home. Teachers, counselors, any person who works in the school can help us. In my junior year I had a classmate who was attending to the school but then she change her classes to online, When I ask her why she change her classes She told me that her mom was fired of her job and She had to start working to support her family. She was 16 when that happened she felt alone with nobody who help her.

Lastly, students has to socialize with other students to feel the sensation of surpassing. If they just does not want to attend school because they are shy or they does not like to interact with other students, We are not educating a good citizen. Students has to feel the sensation of surpassing when they do their homework or when He/She finished their assignments, that sensation the student can not lose. I read in a newspaper a case about Generic_Name, He was 16 when He attended to online classes, He never like attend to school when He discover the option for students to attend classes from home he decided take it. because He never like to interact with other students. After 2 years he graduated, but he never were prepare to socialized with persons, and that affects his personal life.

In conclusion, the offer to learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing in not a good idea because all of them are under 18, They does not have a good criteria to take that big decision that can bring serious consequences or affect their life.",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0
5F1183463E9D,"Thinking ahead of time of what you want to do after high school before you start high school may or may not be a good idea. For example it might get you prepared for what classes you can take your first year of high school. Because high school is all about getting good grade and getting the help you need to become what you want to become in life. High school is where you get your real start to your future. And here are some reasons why.

Thinking about what you want after high school before you even start could be beneficial to you. For example for some it might come as motivation. As in they are at a low point in life where things arent going so great, they could think about what they want tot do and see them selves in the future becoming what they wanted to become. It could even benefit you your first year of high school like picking your classes. You would pick the classes that are most related to the career you want to pursue. Another big thing that is good about looking into what you want to do before high school is the collages as well. Some collages might have the the class you need to finish and major in what you are studying for. It is like a head start on one the classes you take in high school, two the rest of your high school years, three the collage you want to get into.

But there are always some downs to thinking and or knowing what you want to do before you even get to high school. Such as there might not be a class for what you want to major in. Or you might not be eligible for taking that class , they could be over booked in those classes. There might be mix ups with your schedule that may cause you not to get the class you wanted. Even when you have your mind set on one thing for your future your opinion may change over time it may even change completely. And it happens to a lot of students. They make up there minds and then maybe weeks later it may change into something else. There are also other issues with what you want to do in your future. Some students work full time jobs and its hard for those students to focus on one goal and keep up with school work , Sometimes even miss school just because of work. If you think about it even after graduating high school some still work and move on to collage and are still stuck in the mud with work and even harder homework and class work. So dont have a ride to school or even work. Money is a big issue as well. With having to pay for a car or even other life needs you might not be able to get into the collage you want to get into because of how expensive it is. There are student loans but you still have to pay that back and sometimes you can be late on payments but then that doubles and no one wants that.

High school is where your future really begins really. Because if you think about it is where you start learning about where to get your start , how to start , when to start . This is where we as students decide what we want to do in life and where we want to go with it . And if we chose to chance our dream that thats where we end p with hard work and dedication.                   ",3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5
5F467A8F3896,"What are people going do if they find themselves in a situation of danger because of meting the wrong person on social media? No body would like the idea of being on danger but if we do not know how to manege social media we all are in danger. What are people going to do if they find themselves all alone because they did not take the chance of meting someone new, o because they did not enjoy the little moments whit their family? How could someone think that human communication is not necessary? People would not have the chance of having a nice chat whit their family or friends. Although some people say that the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has a positive effect because it helps people whit communication problems interact whit other people due social media, actually the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has many negative effects because people miss priceless moments whit their family and friends and there is a high risk of meting someone dangerous on social media.

People say that the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has a positive effect. This is because they think that it helps people whit communication problems interact whit others due social media. Many studies have showed that social media is very helpful for those people that are insecure of themselves to interact whit others not just from their city but whit people from different places in the world. Technology is advancing, and it is trying to help people whit different needs. In this case technology allows people from everywhere to communicate whit others does not matter the place they are.

It is a privilege for the people that are far away from their families. It is also a way that people use to get away from having uncomfortable chats whit people from their surroundings.

However the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has many negative effects. Because people miss the opportunity of having nice moments whit their family,

their families start to break apart. That's the case of my cousin's family. they were a beautiful family but everything went apart because my cousin's wife spent most of her time on Facebook, where she found a random guy, so she left my cousin whit their three daughters and one son. social media can destroy families and relationships in seconds, but is our duty to enjoy our time whit the people that we love because we show the love that we feel for them and communication by technology can never do that. We do not know if one day the people we love are going to leave, but if they leave we are going to keep those priceless memories on our heart. Family is everything and we should never let anything get us apart from it.

Even if social media allows people from everywhere interact whit each other; there is a high risk of met whit someone dangerous. There are many cases where young ladies have being abducted.

This happen when young ladies decide to met boys from social media that result not being what they thought but kidnappers. Those kidnappers sale the young ladies, and this poor girls are forced to give up on themselves and work as prostitutes.

All of this could be avoided if we start to know better about the people near us instead of trying to met someone that we dont know anything about . It's important to recognize that social media have benefits if we know how to use it correctly, but we need to be careful because we have to know other people better before trusting them, and it is even better if we already have had a chat in person whit those people.

In conclusion the world is constantly changing and technology is an important factor in actuality, but in those cases where technology is used incorrectly many people can get damaged. Technology is not a need but is a benefit, and if we are allowed to use it, we should do it whit responsibility and not depend from it. In spit of the fact some people believe that technology is more than necessary, and that there is no need of human interaction because it helps people with communication problems, in truth the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has just negative effects because we can experience more than one danger; like losing our family or being forced to a prostitute. Communication in person is necessary, there is no better way of live our life than enjoying the time whit our family, the little chats and of curs taking the opportunity of get to know better each one near us. A computer or a phone can never transmit our feelings, and if people want to express themselves they do not have to be trapped on technology.            ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5

Beside, students might not function well, since there is more class time which means more classwork and homework. That is why the school board should not add one and half hour to the school day.

First, some students have sports, clubs and many things to do after school. However, they are tired from the school and school work as a result, they will not function right. For example, my friend plays soccer and she had school for another one and half hour when she went to practice she passed out, since her brain was not function nether were her body.

In my opinion, the most enjoyable educational activity is art because it makes me less stressed out, I could find new styles, it could be my future career.

First of all, it makes me less stressed out about everything. Whenever I take a test, I will start to over think a lot and loose concentration. Most of the time, I will always doodle on my paper because it lets me concentrate more and loose my mind a bit. I mostly take a break whenever I'm taking a test just to calm myself down a bit and doodle. Personally, I took the SOL yesterday and I mostly doodle half of the test because I was over thinking too much. I was stressing out really bad yesterday and I just doodled on my paper. I always doodle on my notes, my work, and my test because it's really fun in my opinion. It helps me a lot and make me concentrate more often now by doing a simple thing like doodling.

Second, I could find new styles in my art. I am a self-taught artist and I like trying out new styles. It's very interesting sometimes and very fun to do. It may be really complex for me but I still try my best to get the hang of it. In my opinion, it is really creative and it may also shows your feelings about life. I could draw how it's like to be scared of the dark or being scared of heights. One of my friends have sleep paralysis and most of the time she draws about how it feels like to have sleep paralysis. It very amusing to me and interesting because it can tell a story about my life.

Additionally, it could be my future career. Since drawing is my favorite thing to do in life it could be easy for me to get a job that deals with art. There are many art programs in college and I'm mostly interested in doing animation. Animation is very complex sometimes depending what type of animation am I doing. There are two main types of animation, 2D and 3D animation. 2D animation is more like a picture and many cartoons use 2D animation. 3D animation is more realistic and it's a lot more complex than 2D because you have to model objects, humans and many others that I could add. 2D animation is more like just drawing on a piece of paper while on the other hand, 3D I had to mostly use a program for to just do 3D animation. Most of the time it is hard to find a job that you want and it takes time and hard work to get it. Mostly my future job would be an animator since I've drew so much in my life.

I love doing art because it makes me less stress out about everything, I could find new styles in art, and it could be my future career. Art is mostly my favorite enjoyable educational activity in school and many other places. It is very enjoyable in my opinion and it really helps me through tough times in life.

The school lunch should to be healthier for student to eat. Otherwise many students will not go to their class or lunch because they skip class to go buy food. Many students at my school argue that the food should change. And others student say the food should stay the same because they like it and it healthier for them. For example one day at my school students got into agreement saying that they are happy with the school menus that they have those why many students do not skip classes. Other students may not like the idea of changing because they think the new change will worst then they have.

If schools change to healthier food for students many student will be in the class to learn and stop thinking about skiing class to go buy food. For example one of my classmate always goes out to from school during class to buy food and i ask him why he said the school food are not good enough for him and those the problem he skip class to go to buy food. changing school food will be good idea and also bad because same students want same food they have now day but other want change and those where all arguing start. The good way to make students happy about is to keep the one they most like and get ruined of the one they do not like.

Some may argue that changing school menu would be bad idea because the new menu would be something that the students may not like do or not healthier for them. Other people think that many students get sick when they eat school food and many students are not learning and they do not go to classes in time or they skip same periods. In my idea i think changing school menu would be good idea because the menus that school provides are not healthier and same of them are not good for our bodies. The best way to provides healthy food for student is change the menu that most students heat.

To summarize, the main reason to change school menus is there are many students agree with the idea and there same who disagree about changing the school menu. I think good way to solve this problem is they have to keep the menu they already have and students like to eat most. And change for those who agree with the idea.

62E5030D1A59,"Imagine getting a job that you're most interested and enjoys the most that later on life, you became super rich or making decent money but doesn't mind as long as you enjoy it and still continuing on. Life can be hard if people don't enjoys their jobs, causing them to have depression. That is why, students should select to visit and learn about the work that interests them because, it gives them more time to think, making plans for their future, and to gain experience through out the school years.

Students should be planning for their future and to decide which class to take in order for them to learn about the work that interests them. Many students have successfully acquired the jobs they intended to work because of how much work they put into to plan and learning the stuff they need to know on how to run the job. Planning is really important for all of our lives. For example, the military uses a plan and tactics in order for them to calculate and for the plan to be successful. Because of that, planning has a big impact in our lives and helps us to decide on what jobs to do and to give us the time to think. This way we can understand the situation and whether or not if the people and their families to decide if it's a good idea.

Students can gain little experience by taking the class every each year, this way students can learn more about the Jobs they want to be in. For example, JROTC are similar to military but trained to be a marching men and to juggle with rifle (from what I know of). They exist because, it helps students to understand what its like for them to experience JROTC. I also think this is very important. It's like, warming up for a swimming contest but, how can you win if you don't know how to swim? Swimming class exist to help people to not drown. If you take swimming class every year, and gain a little bit of experience, you will be able to win the swimming contest. All this reason is to proof of why gaining experience is a good thing and help you understand the job you wanted to applied for.

Giving students the time to think on what jobs their most interested on is also very important for this prompt. For example, students need time to think whether or not if it's the right class for them. Every year in high school students are required to pick three choice to pick their class. It is called the Course Election, where students gets to pick three class that are interesting for them or forced to pick because it is a requirement. I really like this idea, it helps us understand what we're interested on and what to learn. I think three years is enough for students to plan and to have a little experience for their future.

But it's not a good idea just asking your problem or question to one person. Because that person might be wrong and not know ask your examples:mom,dad,ant,uncle your friends anyone you trust and thats how you get multiple opinions and when your making a better choice by asking anyone you know. But don't ask one person cause one that person might not know and two it's not a better choice by asking only one person and sometimes you might not trust that one person by his or it's idea. And you might get your problem or question answered by asking multiple of people.

But some people don't like telling other people there question or problem one cause there scared or shy or they might think that the person will not know or understand what the person is talking about that sometimes can happened it happen to my friend once where he had a math question asked the teacher but the teacher didn't know what he meant or what he was talking about so the teacher tryed to tell him his question but that wasnt the question my friend ask for so he told a student that sits next to him and he understanded what he was talking about so he then helped him with the question he had.",3.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5

First, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because being positive help no to give up. For example, in the text ""People Who Became Successful After Adversities"", many people had a hard time before becoming successful. Even though, that people had adversities they always had a positive attitude towards the problems, that hope they needed to become someone. A positive attitude can change the view of the problems. Having a good attitude help people to not give up when facing adversities.

Furthermore, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because it makes things easier. For example, a person with a positive attitude will always see the good side of the problems.

The attitude with which people face problems, shows the effort and how much people try. A positive attitude make things easier for people to be successful in life.

For example, people who have a positive attitude in life will attract good things, and everything will go well. Even though many people may argue that people does not always need to be positive, a positive attitude will help to make everything go well in life.

To summarize, it has been said that with a positive attitude people become successful in life because a positive attitude help not to give up, and a positive attitude will make things easier to go through.

638D7F913AAB,"Do you think the greatest accomplishment in the world is to be yourself in a world that is trying to change the person you are?, because I do not think people should change themself ever for what god brought us in the world for who we are and not changing ourself for others. So yes, I agree with Emerson statement about individuality, because people in this world are trying to change themselfs for others or just changing themselfs because they dont like themselfs for who they are. There are so many reasons why I agree with this statement especially in today's society that most people in this world are changging themselfs for someone else. I don't agree with the fact that people have the courage to change for others, because in any case they should just be thereselfs and love them for who they are, is the greatest accomplishment and feeling ever.

It is the greatest accomplishment because of the feeling that you loved yourself and secceeded without someone bringing you down and making you change yourself is the best feeling to feel. Otherwise the people who are trying to bring you down are winning and you are giving them the power that they should not have. In today's generation with all the social media we have people that have been rude and comment someting bad to make you feel bad about yourself and then some people change themself just because of a comment that could hurt someone. But if you can secceed people will leave you alone, because they know you will not listen to the rude comments you would recive and there just wasting there time. So then you have the power and accomplished the negetivity that people are trying to change yourself.

Also being yourself does not mean you wont have mistakes because everyone does and that is okay just without you changging yourself and accomplishing thing is the best part of life. It is okay to have mistakes because everyone learns from them and next thing they will do better then the last time they did something bad or had a mistake. People will go through tough times but it does not mean you should automatically change yourself for that. Everyone goes threw a situation that they probebly think they hate themself and wanna change the person they are, but I think that is wrong and they should be thereselfs and understand that everything will be alright at the end without them trying to change themselfs.

In my opinion I do not think that changing yourself will help with anything and I think it would probebly make things worst. LIke for an example if you change yourself nothing is gonna happend just you letting yourself down and changing who you are that should not have been in that situation. Also people would most likely notice and ask why you change yourself and that would bring back memories and make you go back in time and see why you change yourself. But if you dont change yourslef no one would know and wont bring up any badly past back memories. Also mistakes can happend and if you change yourself and go back and see old pictuers of you of how you used to be you might not like for who you are now and you cant go back because you change yourself for someone you did not want to be I mean you could always try but why try after you did it and cant go back.

So just be you and do not change for others who are constantly trying to make you something else who it is'nt you. It is such an amazing feeling and more people in this world would be great if they would'nt change for someone else because they would get the confidence and not worrying about what others has to say about them. People would most likely be so positive if they would be themself and not changing constantly or ever themselfs for people who are ignorent. People who love you would never say to change the person you are because that is just wrong and they know that they would not want to lose you as the person you are. So in all saying that everyone should not change and be themselfs in a world that is constantly trying to change them. ",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5
63C74FF7DB27,"Take learning distance on home is not good ideas . first reason is not the same to take on school. when we going schools we have more option to learning. sometime when we don't undertant something we can ask the teacher for helping or they can explain many times. But sometimes we have to take the classes on home. for example if you are sick or have a spcific reason that you can going schools is necesary take online because if we whant to learn is the matter we we have to take the classes. the important thing is that we have the energy to continues with your goals.

The Learnig distance on home some time be helping to be more possitive and focud because we can take the clases any hours we can. Also when we cut the clases on home we have more chance to listining. The other option to take the clases on home is that we can do other things that we whant.

Some schools give the chance to often the clasas on home that is great ideas. but sometimes is really important to going schools beacuse when we going schools we have more chance to take more clases and graduated with the other student. Also take clases for video conferencing or going school is little similar becuaser we can see the teacher that is explain the clases. That uniquet things is we can not ask the teacher for helping.

In conclusion. To be attend on schools is more important and helping more tham the distance learning or video conferencing. On my posisition attend on schools is more necesary because we have more opportunity to learm and continues to do the things that we whant.  ",2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.5
63E2278271E4,"The British john Lubbock wrote 'your character will be what you yourself choose to make it'

there for is a bit concerning about how kids change there characters just because they dont fell good about them selves and have a lot of thinking inside of them the traits that you carry will have a dominance over them but i dont think that its best answering the question there for do actually they take control beyond our control.

There for it will be not always the case between how other view your things and traits makes you in insecure how other people see you and you change to make your self better than our parents gave us something we just got it from society like there is a lot of influences in the internet and more things that can go far behind the imaginable and they are not controlled by anyone they are just more likely to have more influences beyond there control but there is a lot of influences in this world you just got to find the right one for you and stick with it general likely there is more change in society for different perspectives.

Secondly there is a possible out come that you everyone can get out of this, just like other people that change there perspective at looking at things there for i should say that i have changed a lot since i got here in Virginia and am adapting to being normal well the normal way of being normal for other people there are influences beyond our control because what you see on the internet you will want to mimic it one day like there is a lot of rapers talking about 'girls, god there is a it of are influences in our daily lives always hearing what a rapper did or what type of things he is going to do there for its a bit concerning about all that because for a person that just moved here is a lot of change there is a lot of people that influence almost all the world in California there is where i lived all the artist and musical players and all of them have a purpose of having more people being influenced by them and making a lot of money if they get a lot of attention from a lot of people.

There is kids just like adults that get influence by others there is a possibility that we choose our own ideas of being influenced that are out of our control we choose to be this way we choose our path always they follow what we want there for i am proud of the world we live in.

There is a posibility that new things come out every year new things that 'kill' us or maybe other things like war and most of the things happening to our world and more polution and more virus that want to kill us and it is being more influenced by others to be scared of it becasuse you could die from that there is a lot of thinnking behind every smart influences.

For me however, I would like to visit Generic_City because the people there are well mannered and kind. And also because there are amazing waterfalls and parks.

To begin with, the people there are well mannered and kind because they treat each other like brothers and sisters instead of mortal enemies. And something I would like to do once I arrive, is to greet these grateful and thankful people because they are gentle to one another. Furthermore, most of the people in Dubai make a honest living and there is rarely any crimes caused by residents.

Additionally, there are amazing waterfalls and parks because the designs and structures are well made and created. For instance, when visiting the waterfalls at night, it is very colorful which makes it beautiful to watch. Also, something I would like to do when I arrive, is to go on a boat ride because it is very peaceful and it make you feel calm as the ride goes along.

6531927DF837,"The mind can perform differently when extensively staring into a phone screen and causes a lot of distractions in the classroom setting depending on how it's used. As for educational purposes, using a cellphone to probably schedule some test dates, or save notes for later use can really improve keeping track of class subjects and assignments, considering most individuals carry their cellular devices on them every time of the day. We also have notifications on our devices to notify us on when we've missed an important assignment or other things.

The real issue is whether the students are actually taking advantage of it's dependability to actually improve their classroom performance. The human brain can be effected on how long you use the phone regardless of where you are, and that issue goes across all devices. When having used your phone maybe in the middle of the night before a major test, your sleep is cut by maybe an hour due to the eyes being exposed to blue light shifts, which is the brightness of the phone seeping into your eyes, so it is very critical on how the person uses the device before, during, and after school.

Now another big issue is having the freedom and functionality to use the phone however you'd like. This is where a teenager's habit of text, calling, or sending pictures, brings up the debate of using cellphones for educational purposes. It is very easy to get distracted by other uses of the phone while also very easy to take answers from maybe a friend or find cheat sheets online. We don't have the right to control how people use their phone and that's where my opinion on it leans towards restriction policies and or, giving full responsibility to the teacher about when they can use their phone.

Our phones are also effectively useful for keeping a calendar and keeping us notified of the important things in life especially in the educational sense where paper and memory just don't suit us very well anymore in this day and age. Phone's are evolving rapidly and manufacturers are finding new ways of making them more useful for work, school, and social media. Modern education now requires plenty of technology to keep us updated, and there will eventually be a day where education is fully integrated into computers and touch screen devices.

I do agree we need some form of policy or agenda to make use of the phone to help our student's with how they're approaching their education. Teachers must have to conduct the convenience of the phone and whether a certain student can use it properly and educationally. It is a unique creation we have come to experience in our time, and I hope our generation can think heavily on this matter with a progressive and open mind. All it takes is serious debate and rationality for both sides of a subject matter to be comfortable and conclude with what helps us most while also advancing our students properly.",4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5
6751442A85E4,"I remember when I got in trouble for making the wrong decision. In this essay, I will argue that making decisions on your own can lead to some problems and you need someone's help. People should seek for guidance before making any decisions because it prevents them from getting into trouble, can help you make the right choice, and you can be more successful in life.

Consulting with an expert can help prevent bad situations. Although, it might sound silly sharing your personal life. It can help you in many ways. For example, when you're angry and want to do something that will cost you your whole life. That's the time to express your feeling to someone else. The best way staying out of trouble is having someone guide you because you don't want to end up one day behind bars.

Making the right choices can lead to a healthier life. Meaning that, it's most likely for you to have a positive mind. I remember when I decided to break my friend's trophies. I was so mad that I wasn't thinking right. The next day I woke up and realized what I had done wasn't right. However, I decided to talk to my parents and they gave me some good advises regardless to what I had done. After that, I apologized to my friend and everything went back to normal. I felt relieved because I had so much pressure on me. Sometimes it's better to make the right choices because it releases our stress.

Having a successful life is what everyone wants. In order to be successful in life is to take advises from your parents. As a teenager, we might think we know everything but it's the complete opposite. The key to success is always get advises from an expert or even your parents, which will make you a better person in life.

Some say that, we as teenagers can make decisions on our own; but, they are wrong because not everyone can handle their own situations. Seeking for help from someone else is always a better option. In the future, I hope teenagers like me seek for help when making an important decision.                                 ",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5

She help me with art things, how she become best friend with me, and how she like to help so many people.

She was home school Kindgarden through Third grade, but when she went the Generic_School, and she was put to Third grade. Before Generic_Name met me, she didn't know anyone, she had a different teacher and class. When she in Generic_Name's class, I walk in the class, that is when she first met me ,and Generic_Name told Generic_Name that ""Generic_Name is the same grade as you and you guy can be friends"". After that Generic_Name, and I became friends very fast, as the years past, our friendship grew and now we are in the eighth grade, we still best friend.

Generic_Name likes to help so many people like I do. When somebody drops something, she would pick it up and give it to the person who drops it. She holds doors for teacher, and students even have their hands full with books, or papers. When a friend needs help, she would try to help her friend the best she can because she cares about her friends; want to help them the best can and, she don't give give so easily. She likes to help teachers by help passing out papers, running errands for them, and doing a favor for a teacher.

She is also good at help people with art things because she and I are taking art class this years, but her art class comes first and I have art class second. She likes to tell me what the art homework is ahead after the class is over, and going to her next class. When I need help of what I should include, I would ask Generic_Name, and she would give me some advise of what I include in my art drawing. I would said to Generic_Name "" That is great idea, Generic_Name, thank you so much""!

Some times to have a good idea, she will get a computer look for some good ideas, or used your imagination.

I disagree with the saying ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" because not everyone learns from there mistakes. some people cannot remember if they had a mistake a long time ago and that mistake comes up again, for example, my brother had failed his drivers test and when he took it again he failed again. Furthermore, when your nervous and you had a problem, Some people get trauma and they think of that problem and they are afraid of doing it again, For example, I missed a tackle at football once and I was scared of doing it again, so when I had the chance of doing it again I thought about if i would miss it like last time.

I disagree with the saying ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" because the problem may have had already affected them so they would not be able to change it. some people may have made a really big mistake so they would not be able to be the best if they have had that chance. For example, somebody on the news had the death penalty for murder so they would not be able to change that. Furthermore, people have had the opportunity to get something great but they chose not to, they cannot go back and change that. for example my sister got this award but she refused to take it so she cant go back.

I disagree with the saying ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best'' because the way to be successful in life is to hardly have any mistakes. A lot of people had had many mistakes in their life and failed to achieve their goal, for example, my cousin wanted to be a lawyer but then had a lot of problems with what she was doing so she quit law school. when people have a lot of mistakes they tend to get more mistakes and then they end up trying to figure out how to deal with all them. for example, I was taking a test and I tried to figure out some of the questions at once but then I ended up mixing all of them up.

In conclusion,I disagree with the quote ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" because not everybody can acknowledge what do do after they have made a mistake, the problem may have already have had a negative impact on them already, And the way to be great is to rarely have any mistakes",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

698A3F2B43B9,"Have you ever thought about staring your future career in a young age? Well, This question has been asked to a lot of people. Lot's of people have responded to this question saying ""yes"" and ""no"". Everyone has their reason why they start in a young age and why they don't start in a young age. In my opinion young student's should start to think about their future career in a young age because it will give them an idea of what they want to be in their life and they will know what kind of courses or classes they will be taking to get to their goal. Even though, some would argue that young student's shouldn't start to think about their future career in a young age because they will spend less time with friends and family.

My first example is, it will give them an idea of what they want to do in their life in the future. For example, young age student's can change their mind and might not want to choice that path no more. Also, If that happens, young student's get's lots of time to think of another career path they want to take. For example, a kid is thinking about being a police but then later on he wants to be a doctor, that give the kid time to think about what he wants to be. Lastly, student's get a head start of what their future career is going to be like. In addition, This head start gives them time to plan and organize everything they need. For example, kid's have lots of things they want to be so they get a head start so they can get an idea of what career they choices to take.

My last example is, They will know what kinds of courses or classes they will be taking to to get to their goal. For example, student's can choice the right classes that will help them achieve their goal. Also, they don't have to stress out about them taking the wrong classes. Like, If a kid want's to be a doctor when he grows up he will already choice the courses of being a doctor. Lastly, student's knows what types of material they will need for the classes; to help them get prepare. In addition, This helps the student's a lot because they will already have the mind set to think of what they will be needing in the future. Like, that's a good skill to have, knowing what you need in the future and not worry about it in the last minute.

Some would argue that student's shouldn't start to think about their career in a young age because they will spend less time with their friends and family. For example, kid's are so full of energy and want to go out and have some fun all the time. Also, they want to make precious time and memories with their friends and family. Sure , it's nice to go have some fun and get to enjoy life with the ones you care about more. However, you got to remember that you going to be the one responsible for your own future and if you put effort your going to have an amazing impact in the future with your career.

In conclusion, student's should start to think about their career in a young age because it will give them an idea of what they want to do in their life and they will know what kinds of courses or classes they will be taking to get to their goal. It will keep them focuse on their goals and will make a big impact in their lives since they already have everything planed out. In addition, this will prepare them for the real world.

Reason number one students can feel a lot of pressure on them. Reason number two students still do not know what them want to be yet.

Students can get a lot of pressure because students have not found out what they want to do in life. Students can get over welled so easily. Students think about it to much what they want to be when they grow up. Especially freshman they just stated school they do not need any stress when it comes to think about their career. Freshman do not what they want to be yet. They are just new kids that have just stared high school and they do not need to think about it yet. Students already have enough stress and, they do not need anymore of that. Students already have stress from school, sports, home problems, and the list can go on.

Students still do not know what them want to be yet. It is hard to find something want you like to do in life as your career such as a young age. Students may thing they have found the one that they really want to do in life but, they change their mind and, they what want to go for the other career. Therefor, students need more time to think about what they want to do in life. It takes time to think about what students what to be to grow up. There is a lot of things to do for your career so students just have not found the right one yet. They need time to make sure what they really want to do in life and they feel it is the right one.

Some might says it is a good idea for students to commit a career such a young because it will benefit them in life. Here it is were I am go to prove them wrong. Students get stress so easily and they do not need any more of that. Students do not need to feel pressured and it is okay to say that they do not know what that want to be when they grow up. It is not okay to rush students as they enter high school. Students can make their own mind when the thing it is the right time and, also they think they really think what they want to be when they grow up just give them time.

No matter what they say, don't let it get in your head just focus on getting to master your talent first.

Practice makes everything perfect even if you found something new, and you want try it out. The first time you won't get it so easily like you thought you would, but though lots of practice you will get it right in no time and better at it to. An example of this is if you're riding a bike, you fall down, but through practice you'll be riding your bike without falling off of it anymore.

We were all born with some talent that we don't know of, we just got to figure out what it is. If you found something you're really good at, then stick with at all times, and never let that talent slip away. If it does then you will be forgetting everything, and the talent you once had, and you'll have to find a new one. Based on your experiences try to find something different but a little simmer.

For example, if you worked at fast food restaurant you might want to work at a store next time. They have one thing in common is money.

Whether having a talent or just practicing, know that you're having fun whether you hate it or love it, and not for very long you will master it in no time.

All the students that study in her home for online have that being responsible.

First, some students that have that working for help at her parents and also study in home. For example, Generic_Name that working everyday the week him want that her parents have a better life economic. Generic_Name to take a choice to go out the school and Generic_Name put at working. Him search the best way for have a job and help at her family with expense the home, Generic_Name also study choice take classes in home every night.

Generic_Name learned the her mistakes and finish her studies and now she was in the university study for nurse, and is a better person and responsable with her studies.

First, discusing in groups is one thing that partnership is. If one person doesn't get something another person can come up with other ideas. If I came up with new ideas i can share my ideas with the group i'm in. People can also hear what another student can up with in their own ways. Students can also correct themselves if they messed up on a word.

Second, working in groups is another idea of working with partners. People can help one another if they are having trouble understanding something. I can also learn new things just by hearing what a student came up with. In a group we can also check each others paper to see what they came up with. We can all work together to come up with new ideas so that our paper makes sence.

Third, by learning more we can get the hang of using that learn strategy. Coming up with new ideas to improve our writing. In group we can talk about each others paper if we think there should be a puncuation ore if a word is spelled wrong. If someone didn't puncuate a sentence correctly we can find a good puncuation to place it so that it would sound right. we acn also revise our paper to each other and hear what each others paper needs correction.

The reason are so many and complicated to explain right now, that is why I am only gonna explain and give example to three of those reason. One of them are that students should not go to college at very early age or go to the minlatary at very early age, Because of the their are not older anough and are not anough responsible handle to much presur in college and in high school, and most ot the time they don't really know what they want to be when grow up, and the course during summer and evenings are not much presur for the students.

They don't have the experience about what is life look like and how harts it is. They would not have any freedom duirng their all life if they follow that plan, because they always will be ""between four walls"", that's not the life that people want and that's not the sad path that parents want for the children I guess and I hope, but you never now what parents want and never ask what you want, and is another presur on their shoulders.

The elective courses are a way to expriment other classes and learn something else that students really want to do or maybe would like to do, I admint that students will learn the necessary, but not what they want, their will be sad if they never had a freedom to do what they want to.

In my conclusion: it's better to take things with calm and peace, not to take it to fast, we still have bunch of time to decide what's really matter and what's matter to us.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5

In my opinion I think it would be bad for them If teenagers stay until after 10 p. m and not having a curfew, so it is good for them to have it because of these three examples.

If this was a law I think it would be good for them to have the curfew because they will have a time limit and they'll know what time to not go outside, because if the stay outside until after 10 p. m they are basically breaking the law.

I think it will be good for them because if they don't have it it will interfere their lives and their life schedule. And it will make them and keep them unorganized about everything. Because they can't sleep well, they won't have enough energy to keep up with their daily works.

In my opinion it will be good for them to have it because, it would be more safe for them and they will be more safe and it will keep them away from danger and trouble. Because they will know that after 10 p. m it might not be safe for them.

In conclusion it is good for the teenagers to have a time limit or a curfew for them to go outside. Because it will keep them safe and out of trouble. And it will make them and keep them organized. And the point is that if it was a law. It would've be better for them.

6D21E6095A62,"Many schools are starting to offer online schooling for students. Students or teachers may believe this can be a very beneficial program. However, I believe that online classes can be difficult or tough on a student. Students some times need an actual teacher showing or explaining to them face to face content, others take extra-curricular activities, and many students may even forget they have an online class.

First, not every student can learn by just one explanation, many students need a teacher showing them or explaining how to do something. Take for example my cousin, She's taking online classes but has a difficult time learning the material because she doesn't understand the explanation they are giving her. Her struggles with the material is there because she doesn't have an actual teacher explaining why such ans such are like that. Not many students have the capacity to learn off of the words of a website. Many students need that extra help, whether its a different way of learning or just a better explanation.

Secondly, A large amount of students take extra-curricular activities. Many are in an art club, Spanish club, and maybe even drama. The struggles for taking an online class for those would be a large amount. For example, The time I took an online class for art, it was terrible, either I didn't know how to transfer my painting to the computer or I just didn't know how to draw the picture. Extra-curricular activities would be difficult to learn without the extra help of a teacher.

Lastly, Students can even forget they have an online class. Many have jobs, others just like to sleep, they'll forget they have a class online and forget to turn in the work. For example my cousin, she sleeps a lot, By the time she wakes up she realizes that her assignment was already due. Online classes don't send out reminders of the assignment so any student can easily forget and fall behind the rest of the class.

In conclusion, online schooling isn't very beneficial. I believe that it can be tougher and more difficult on students. Many need a teacher to show them face to face content, some take extra-curricular activities, and majority of the students forget they even have an online class. For those few reasons is why online schooling shouldn't be an option to students. ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5
6D6E937C3A67,"We do not choose our own character, if everyone gets to choose their own character nobody will have any bad people in this world, everyone would be full of good things because they will be able to pick their characteristics. If everyone had the same characteristics life would not be as good as it is now. Each person has different characteristics based on their culture, environment, childhood makes difference in their character. These are the three main reasons that differentiate people's characters, and makes them good in their own way.

Each person has had a different childhood which is an important part of people's characters. Childhood is very important because it is the the base of the building this is where person starts building their knowledge. Childhoods can effect kids when they grow up in a lot of different ways. A lot of teachers in the middle east hit their students when they do not do homework or get a bad grade on a test, this makes the students not wanting to go to school and hating school because they get hit in front of their friends, this does not give students enough confidence which is going to effect their characters in the future. Children who spend hours and hours on video game and making online friends, this make them anti-social people when they get older.

People's environment such as work place, friends has a lot of effects on their characters. If a person has a lot of bad friends that person's character is not gonna be the same as a person who hangs around with good friends, for example if a guy has friends who do drugs even if does not do them step by step they are going to get him to do it and that will start making changes in his character, on the other hand if a person has good friends who tell him let's go to the library to read or study that will have a positive effect on that person,s character. In work if a person is working and his manager yells at him that will lower his self confidence and have a negative impact on his character.

Culture has a big impact on a person's character in a lot of different ways. Culture is what is going on around the person and what he believes in or does not believe in. Sometimes cultures effect the person's character in good ways sometimes in bad ways. Culture makes people religious, pray and be good people. Sometimes culture does not give the person the freedom they need for example, in the middle east sex before marriage is not allowed which makes a lot of difference in peoples characters making them do secret stuff and not being able to communicate with the other gender because they are not even allowed to talk to each other because of culture.

In conclusion people do not get to choose their character. People's character is formed by a lot of different things such as environment, culture and childhood these are the most important to form a person's character. At the end of the day all characters are good in their own way, the difference between people is what makes them stand out and complete each other.

6D8B9B8431A6,"It has been said that working with a group benefit more than working alone because it can be more fun. Have you ever been in a situation where you feel alone and you don't want to do any homework. I agree that working with teammates can help us feel better and they push us to be better . Although some say working alone is beneficial because we don't waste our time, actually working with a group is more beneficial because we can share information and work fast.

Some say that working alone is beneficial because we don't waste our time. Working alone can save our time because we can work at home, we don't need to wait for the rest of the group or even go somewhere else. For example, last year, my Science teacher gave us a group assignment where we needed to meet each other outside of school. That day my group and I talked where to see each other, then we went to Generic_Name's house. We enjoyed talking and eating but we never talked about the project. All I can say, we all just waste our time.

However, working with a group is more beneficial because we can share information. It is true that many heads think better than one because if one comes with an idea then all together discuss about it. Furthermore, some child think better if one person gives them an idea. For example, before doing a class work I always have to ask my teacher if what I'm thinking is correct because my mind gets freeze out. Working alone doesn't help in answering doubt that we could have.

Also, working with a group is a great benefit because we can work fast. All the group can work at the same time, some can do the posters, others can look for information, and the rest can divide the information about what theme each one is going to talk during the presentation. A survey showed that a faster way to work is working in groups because all the team can work in different areas at the same time. It means that working with a group is a great benefit, it help us to have better thoughts.

Working with a group can bring joy to our soul by making new friends. We can work and have fun, also working with a team is great because we can talk not just about the project, but our lives. Moreover, a group work can make learning more passionate.

In conclusion, working alone is beneficial because it can save our time, actually working with a group is more beneficial because all the group can share information and that can bring a faster work.

6E3D46F9AAE1,"It is true that as soon as you stop learning, you stop growing as a person. Learning is what we spend most of our human lives doing; when you stop learning, you almost stop living -because what are you going to do then? Do the same things over and over again? You will always eventually reach a point when you are not even satisfied with what you do and know.

I think we all have struggled with dissatisfaction at many points of our lives, it is as if we have reached a point where we do not know what to do next. Satisfaction restricts creativity; you start doing the same things over and over again, and like a scratched disc, the music gets irritating. Life gets irritating. The stuff that used to bring us joy have been overdone and gotten boring, we need something new. We are always looking for something new. We never reach complete satisfaction. It is part of our nature, curiosity.

Even the things you are passionate about will lose their meaning. We need to do other stuff that we are not as passionate about to know what we are actually passionate about. Imagine me, a two-year guitar player with dreams of become a musician/music producer, going to college to study music and only music (mastering the guitar and only the guitar). It might be a bit unrealistic, we all know we have to take multiple classes to get a degree, but imagine if that was my only things. How will I bring something new to the table when all I know is what the past musicians have discovered and put together? My only option is to replicate and do over what has been done. I will need to find a new inspiration, a new thing to influence my music besides my music studies. This new inspiration will affect how my art grows, which is a reflection of how much I have grown as a person. We need growth.

Limiting what you do, causes you to shrink. I have always put limits to the kind of people I can become friends with. It was not always much of a choice, but now it is. I have reached points where I could not be with anyone because I was stuck in a group of people that I did not like. I still get to those points sometimes, and I get sad very easily because I am unsatisfied with my friendships. Dissatisfaction has become a normal and almost natural part of my existence, which makes life much harder than it has to be. You complicate the human experience and it makes you shrink as a person, something you should avoid doing (you should always be going after growth). Limitation in most cases is not a good thing.

Sure, many might say mastering on something that you love takes you through all the processes you need to grow as a person, but that is putting limits to how you grow and what you love. We can learn to do new things that we love and get to know ourselves better. There are always parts of you that you do not know or have not discovered because you limit your loves. As has been said before, we need to get to know things that we do not love to know what we love; it makes everything you love much more meaningful when you have to get to know something that you do not like.

Doing things beyond what we have mastered helps us to grow and be happier. Once you stop doing and learning, dissatisfaction (and sadness) consumes your life and leads to a dangerous path. Emerson was right and very wise about what he stated. We should always be going after growth.",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5

Maybe I can be a little annoying sometimes with my peers, but that doesn't mean that they don't like me. They hang around because they know how I am and what I do when they are around me. In the end of the day it doesn't bother me if they like me or not, because I know they are gonna come back and enjoy the day with me.

This first impression thing had me thinking about something that happen a long time ago. It's not based on my experienced, but one my best friend's that we go back a long way in middle school. He told me that he didn't like me that much so we didn't talk too much. He didn't even talked to me when we where around each other, but something happen that change our friendship. There was guy who always was there with him the guy had done something terrible and caught suspended for sometime. My friend and I started talking more, after the guy got suspended he told that he didn't like me because I was dating someone he liked that's what happen.

My first impressions where good cause everyone that I know are cool with me, but if it wasn't I could of make-up something to be good with them. This thing about first impressions is not that hard to if you have charisma or personality in you. I never had a hard time making friends, because I have personality and charisma this two things you need to have if you wanna be friends with someone or making a first impression. There was a time that I went to talk with my father-in-law that day I was super nervous to even talk to him. In the end my father-in-law was just a great guy we talk about every comment he had to talked.

I don't get nervous about nothing, but he was tall and looked like a hard-dude. Even thought I all ready knew him he still looked intimated to look at him. Her wife was the opposite of him she was pollute and nice with me, but I knew that all ready because I seen her in parties. It was a good impression in the end we broke-up in a few days, but we still friends her mom still remembers me that good. sometime it is hard to make a good impression with people you know.

It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. My conclusion I disagree about that, cause me personal I don't have issues with no one around me. It's just that you need personality and charisma to make a good impression in my opinion. So go and look for that its's not difficult to have that.

6F3C318ED62E,"Of course that i'm agree with Churchill's statement, because for to have success or to be successful in the life you need to have many failures. No one is perfect and you don't need to be it for be successful. This quote reminds me when my grandfather used to tell me "" Son, if you wanna be someone important on the life your gonna have ups and downs, don't matter how many failures your gonna have, but however, in spite of everything your gonna achieve your goals and dreams without matter what other people says about you, the most important is not loss the enthusiasm"".

I think that if you do your best on everything and you try to do it better always your gonna achieve your goals. You don't need to do it perfect all the time, because despite everything you always gonna have a failure but that doesn't mean that your gonna stop try to do your best or your gonna loss all your enthusiasm, it's mean that despite of each failure your gonna follow your goal. No matter how many times you need to do it, just try it!!!.

The failure plays a important role for be successful, everybody has ups and downs, for example:

In the school, if you have a test and you were studying for that test but you fail, don't stop just try it again and try do it better the next time.

For a job, if you are searching a new job and you completed many applications for any job but no one is requesting you for a interview, or unfortunately, you not were accepted on that job, don't matter, you will find another job, just don't loss the enthusiasm.

In a relationship, if you like a girl or boy and you declare your love at her/him but you not were accepted for her/him or what's more worse she/he doesn't like you, don't be sad you will find the right one for you.

In a career, if you wanna have a important job like lawyer but you have a failure in the progress, don't loss your enthusiasm you can try with another profession like nurse or another that you like it.

In the life, i say in the life because i have a stepfather that he always says that he is right all the time when it's not true but he never want to accept that he are wrong and that't a problem, because if you never listen at the other people that are right then your gonna have a failure in the future, for the same reason that you thought that you were right when you doesn't.

Be successful in the life is not something easy at the contrary it's hard because in the progress you always gonna have many failures, but however, nothing is impossible in the life with enthusiasm and to much effort you gonna achieve many big things, always fight for your dreams and goals. Remember nobody is perfect on this life and you are strong and intelligent don't matter how many troubles or failures you have just try to do your best and fight for everything that you want.

In conclusion to have failures is not bad at the contrary is very good for you because you learn more about how to do it better the next time. My mom always say: "" Each failure it's make you more strong and more intelligent "", and the truth that's true, you never gonna learn about your error if you don't have a lesson for to learn but everything without loss of enthusiasm.",3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,3.5
71131D46F019,"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose. People think it is a good idea for students to have phones for educational purpose. I believe students should not have phones in classrooms because students could easily get distracted, they will not have the chance to learn better, and having a phone should be a privilege.

First reason why I believe we should not have cell phones for educational purpose is ,students will get distracted. They will start using their phones for other purposes that are not educational or what their teacher has recommended. Students will start texting instead of doing their assigned work the teacher gave them. Students will start thinking it is okay for them to take out their phones when it is time for learning.

Second reason i believe it is wrong for students to have cell phones in classroom. Students will not have the chance to learn how it use to be. Students that actually take notes have a better chance to memorize what they learned and doing better in tests. When teachers do hands on work during class students can learn and teach their peers.

Last reason why i believe students should not have phones during class is ,phones are a privileged to have. Teachers should not allow phones during class time because students will not know when is the right time to have phones during class. Even if they put strict rules students will find a away to go around those rules.

In conclusion, this is why I believe some schools should not allow phones in classrooms. Students will get distracted, they will not get the chance to learn more, and having phones is a privilege.

She would tell me me not to use the word you. By the end of the year I was not using the word you. She had told me that my English skills were improving because I had been working on it all year. She told me that i was a strong writer. If one has the knowledge, skills , and information he can accomplish anything.

If one has information he can accomplish any goal in his way. When i was in high school I wanted to take welding as a class. I had no information on how to join the class. I asked my friend on how i could join he told me that I had to go to the office to get the information that I needed. With the information that I got I now had to fill it out so that I could join the class next year. if one has the knowledge,skills, and information he can accomplish anything.

If everybody in the community had the Knowledge ,skills, and the information then everybody would accomplish a goal. Although others think that they should not be focused on accomplishing a goal. One should have theses skills so that they can accomplish anything that they want.         ",3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

I'm a great candidate that employers are looking for because I spend time volunteering at school and working with job owners as a helper. I take care of people kids and work as a school bookkeeper all school year. however, some people may think having more experience is better than being responsible, having experience help but having responsible help employers trust you more with important job. But I manged how many people check out book out of school and I clean the library some times. Later in the year i volunteer at a two company has a filer. I plan paper for employer because they know that I'm responsible to do the job and get done.

In addition, Im a hard-working person because I have a job and play sport but I my time to volunteer some time. I do a lot of work so I don't have to do anything later or the next day.

72C0B0B91BFC,"There are so many things that can make good deed too someone with a good attitude even you can make yourself happy, But sometimes its hard to keep a good attitude while its a difficult time. I myself have witnessed someone with a good attitude it was my good old friend he was having a good attitude all day,But than someone in his family passed away he was really sad about it. Than his attitude was going bad I tired to make his day get better to go and get ice cream but than he was up for it so I was in a good attitude so was he so we were happy, But than his mom got really sick and the doctors said that she might not make it and than he shaded tears and than his day was just going horrible. So much was going on with his family like his mom is so sick she can barley move she was taken to the hospital because she had a high fever of 103. The day they took her to the hospital has got a heart attack at the night she was there and when she was there for a few days and than they brought her back home and that same night she got a heart attack again and my friends dad just said she can't leave the hospital or she might die if we take her back a few weeks passed and his mom recovered and now they are a happy family.

I have witnessed my family member have a good attitude even during a difficult time. One of my family members were going though depression but no one else knew because everyday he always looked happy there was always a smile on his face when someone saw him there was not a time he looked upset or sad but just happy all the time. No one knew what he was going through they didnt know he was getting bullied,failing his classes and last of all no friends he thought he had no one and he kept telling himself he was alone. Everyone thought he was mad at something little like him not getting a toy or something because he was just a 10yr boy the rest of the family thought he was just a regular little kid running around all over the place laughing at everything and even cry at little stuff, but no he did nun of that all he did was just stay in his room lights turned off and the door was shut and locked. But than one day he forgot to lock his room and than I walked in and he was just crying and kept saying ""I got nobody I got nobody"" and than i made him feel better and then we put him in counseling for a few months and he started getting better and better while time went on.

When you have a good attitude it can make your day be good and you'll be positive with everything. Even in a bad times like for example if a family member or a friend is sick you can make there day by getting them there favorite food or snack that can get them in a good attitude with you because they may be a little grumpy while there sick.

While your in a good attitude you'll feel like you accomplish something for today and while other people will try to take you down you mind and your feeling will be strong and you won't be able to be in a bad attitude. Most people would want to be be in a good attitude but others are the world should just be happy and not always mad at something. I wish everyone in the world can be happy and something they did and not be mad at everything like sometimes when you play sports when you lose its a little upsetting at first but than you lose your attitude get stronger and you start being your self way more.

I witnessed another of my friends trying to keep a good attitude his attitude was getting stronger and better because he played a lot of soccer but than his dad kept taking it to seriously. My friend was so tired that he wanted to take a break but his dad didnt let him he kept telling him get up lets go play everyday and on weekend his dad woke him up at 5 in the morning to go play soccer. Than on Monday when he got back to school he started getting eye bags under his eyes and than he was tired of it and went o his dad and i said '' Im tired of soccer and i give up''. His dad looked so shocked and upset that he left him speechless and than he said fine when you grow up you are not going to become a famous soccer player. My friend still played soccer but he only played when he wanted to and he still was really good at soccer that I bet you he is better than me.

One time my friend and I were in a good attitude right we were playing at the park and than my friend jumped off the slid and than he broke his arm is was so nasty His bone was popping out he was crying and yelling and Ididnt know what to do and i called his partents they came so fast and than they took him to the hospetil and I was sad because I felt like it was all my fault and than his partents cheered me up and they said ''its not yout fault its okay its just a common mistake and a few weeks later his arm got better his arm was in a case so he was good and I was the first one that sighned it so i was happy about that and than we were both happy we got ice cream and we had a sleepover and the rest of the day was good.",2.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
7373B4F44528,"Have you ever accomplished something in your life? Because people nowadays are very lazy and hard headed because they are easily distracted by social media, people around them, and also the society that's why they cannot focus on their goals in life. Although some might argue it is not better to work on something to accomplish, actually it is better to work on something to accomplish because you will gain more knowledge and people will be proud to what you've accomplished.

One reason why it is better to work on something to accomplish is because you will gain more knowledge. For instance, based on my personal experience when I was in middle school, I dont do my projects, homework, seat works because I'm too lazy and I just love talking with my friends everyday in our class. However, when I moved here in America last year things have changed because I'm new here in this country and I dont know anyone. I realized that my friends here are not the same like in the Generic_City that I used to talk to everyday. That's why I decided to study hard and make my parents proud again. I have an five A's in my classes right know and I'm proud because I accomplished something. And yes, Thomas Jefferson was right ""Determine never to be idle.. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something.""

we should never stop doing something that can benefit us. This proves that working on something will help you gain more knowledge in life and dont stop believing in yourself. Another example that proves it is better to work on something to accomplish is based on my dad's personal experience. My dad was a college graduate in the Generic_City, he dreamed to become a successful businessman and he made it. My dad started a business near to schools and shops so many people will go to his store. The first few months was amazing because his customers was very loyal to him my dad didn't expect that it will happen. Unfortunately, my dad's business went down because something happened that he didn't liked. People are robbing and digging all the way to my dad's store every night. That's why he was forced to closed his business and rest for a while. After a few years he didn't have a job because he was still shocked to what happened to his business. However, he decided to take culinary class to work again because he wants to help our family and to gain more knowledge about baking. After taking the culinary, he went to Generic_City to seek new opportunity. He is now currently working in five star restaurant owned by a rich man in Generic_City. This proves that it is better to work on something to accomplish like what my dad did in his life and he changed for a better living.

Another reason why it is better to work on something to accomplish is because people will be proud to what you've accomplished. For example, from the movie

PELE

it is about a young boy who dreamed to become a professional football player. He lived in a small house in Brazil and played football with his friends in his neighborhood. Pele was a poor little kid but plays well even he is very short unlike other people in his town. When they play against other teams, they always laugh at them because they dont have a proper gear for playing. And there is a guy who is recruiting players for their club. Pele was the youngest player in the club thats why he was treated like a slave. After few years playing in his club, its his time to shine to represent Brazil in the world cup. Pele scored a lot of goals and Brazil went to the finals. He was so incredible that time no one can stop him and Brazil won the world cup. This proves that you need hard work to accomplish something like Pele he never stop doing what he wanted to be and now people from Brazil and all over the world are proud of him. Another example that proves it is better to work on something to accomplish comes from Adidas' quote or saying ""All in or nothing"". For instance, that line is very effective to people especially the athletes around the world because doing your goals in life makes you more stronger and better than the others. And you should give your best all the time and make people proud to what you've done in life. This proves that is it better to work on something to accomplish like the owner of Adidas he became famous and rich because he worked hard, focused on his goals.

The other side will argue it is not better to work on something to accomplish because you will have more time to do what you want or something else. However, it is better to work on something because you can practice your weaknesses. For example, my friend Generic_Name who really dont know how to write a perfect essay but can speak fluent in English. He was really bad in writing essay when we were in middle school. Generic_Name was always shy to read or present his work to our teacher. So, I told him to work with my classmate who is really good in making essay and ask him to teach Generic_Name how to write a perfect essay. After a few weeks of learning, Generic_Name improved his writing skills. This proves that it is better work on something to accomplish like what my friend Generic_Name did he started practicing his weakness and became a good writer. Another example that proves that it is better to work on something to accomplish is based on my personal experience. For instance, I've been playing football since 5 years old because my dad is also a football player. When I was playing with my club my coach said my first touch is not really good unlike the other players. However, I practiced by myself like what what coach told me. And my mentality was I should prove my coach that I will be a better football player. This proves that practicing your weaknesses will make you more a better person.

To conclude all these statements above, it is better to work on something to accomplish because you will gain more knowledge and people will be proud to what you've accomplished. We people have different purposes in life, we should never be idle in life.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5
746A0BFABA84,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Why should first impressions defined who you are? Why are they so ""impossible"" to change? are first impressions really that important, why should something so small change the way you think about someone. First, no one is perfect. Everyone has very different personalities or ways of being. Second, it should't defined who we are. First impressions don't always go well, you should be able to change that. Finally, It could ruin your reputation. A lot of people care about their reputation a lot. To the point that it could be emotionally wrecking

First, no one is perfect. We aren't perfect beings, we all have different personalities. Different things we do that others don't and some people may think its weird or we are weird to do that. That's when first impressions come to play. Meeting someone for the first time can often be hard to manage since is the first time you are meeting this person. Truly anything could go very wrong. They could think they way you talk, eat, and act is weird because you are trying way to hard for it to not go bad and sometimes that comes out as bad. Life sometimes will go wrong and we can't change that or let it get the best of us because we aren't perfect and it's okay if sometimes things don't go our way of liking. if it goes bad we should be able to change it or try again.

Second, it should't defined who you are. Every human is not alike in any way possible, all of us are unique in our own way. Sometimes we make mistakes and theres cases where people don't like that. When you are on a stated of mind of anger, you could do something drastic but that doesn't defined who you are on your heart and mind. You have your own mistakes and flaws but that isn't you is just a part of you that doesn't think and does thing on impulse. When you are trying to make everything perfect that person it could stress you out really bad and anything could make you go off. when it's the first time meeting that person it can really tress you out bad but that's okay. First impressions should be able to be change because if that were to happen it could really damage a person if that certain person was important to them. You should be able to reschedule the date when everything is better and you can be normal. If they are truly your friend they will allow to you to that.

Finally, it could ruin your reputation. Let's say you are the most friendly person in your school and everyone likes you because of how fun or nice you are. you would love to keep that way. But one day a new student comes to your school and you introduce yourself but right out of the bat they don't like you without knowing anything about you. That thought could eat you up for the rest of the time, and you try and try to get that person to like you but they don't. Being able to change that first impression is all that you would like to do but it feels impossible. But it isn't impossible if that person wanted to get to know you they could but they don't want to and yes there's people like that all over the world. Having a second chance could change everything for you but we should't let it get the best of us that person will come around at their own time. We can't make people be our friend if they don't want to. If they want to get to know you they will.

Conclusion, First impressions are not important things will go wrong sometimes and that's okay. We can always try again another day, it should't get the best of us or makes us feel some type of way if that person truly wants to be your friend they will not care about the mistakes you make or anything around that. You are human and you make mistakes sometimes. And that's okay, it doesn't defined who you are;only you know who you are on the inside. First impressions should't even be a thing they stress you out and makes you over think. Being able to change the impossible is something we should be able to do always. Don't let anything like that make you think less of you. ",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5
74FF4379012C,"BEING YOURSELF.

Being yourself is by far the most fulfilling accomplishment any individual would have ever made. Not only does it take a lot of confidence, devotion, and self acceptance, but also the ability to learn, understand and love yourself both internally and externally.

people tend to have different role models for various reasons, for example my younger sister always wanted to be like the famous singer Beyonce because she had a beautiful voice. They might have some things in common which draws them closer to the idea of being just like them. Little do they know that them turning out exactly just like their role models is almost impossible because they lack their unique personality traits and acquire their own completely different set of traits which makes them who they are.

The sooner people realize that each individual is unique in one way or another the better. Being yourself does not mean breaking the rules because you like it but doing the right thing in your own unique way. Not only does that stand out but also makes you feel good about yourself. A perfect example would be comedian Liza Koshy from YouTube who made a whole career out of being unapologetically herself while she did comedy!.Using her as inspiration would be healthier than aspiring to be just like her.

With that I conclude that being yourself is not necessarily a walk in the park but putting effort into it would make a bigger difference than following the crowd. Ideas lead to actions and by visualizing yourself doing things correctly but in your own way is killing two birds with one stone! Author Waldo Emerson was right about being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else being the greatest accomplishment.           ",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0

759E0659FF69,"A city council is debating the adoption of a 10pm weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. does curfew help teenagers or not help teenagers. Curfew is a bad idea because curfew do not help teenagers on weekday and also the weekends. My tops three reasons are stay out more, sink in/out the house, and they can get in trouble.

When teenagers stay out more it because they want hang more with their friends. My friends and i hang out and we smoke. My curfew was 11pm and i didn't check the time then i know that it was past my curfew i ask my one of my friend if he can give me a ride home i got my house keys. When my friends drop me off at my house and i open door of my house than i saw my parents sleeping and the next day my mom ask if i came back to the house at my curfew and i said yes and i got always with it.

Teenagers also sink in/out of the house. Some may say that curfew help teenagers to be home on time. They are wrong because most teenagers sink out of their bed room window. One night around four in the morning i was sleep and then i heard lot of noise. I got up from my bed and i saw my sister sink in from my bed room window and so help her to get in my room but around that time we are sharing my room because we had a room met. We both went back to bed and i told we will talk about this in the morning. In the morning i ask her why she sink out the room and she said that she need to think things over, she could't sleep, and she want go outside. I told her what happened if someone just take you and then what happened. She said well no one did and i told yeah thank god. We didn't our parents.

Most teenagers can get in trouble with their parents. When teenagers get in trouble it mostly with their parents because most parents are strict. When parents are strict it that they want what best for their children than they had. When teenagers are in trouble the person they go running to is their parents because they know they something bad and now they need help for it. On a weekend my friends and i are doing weed in one of my friend basement and her parents catch us doing weed and her parents told my parents. When i got home my parents were in the table and we all talk. My parents told me to stop doing weed so i did but few years later i was doing weed again and again they found out somehow. We talk about it now i stop doing weed for good.

Curfew is a bad idea on a weekday and weekends. Curfew do not help teenagers on weekdays and weekends because they can stay out more, sink in/out the house, and they can in trouble. This are all my tops three reasons.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0
75B44E3CE6DD,"A positive attitude is not the key to success in life instead a hard working attitude is the the real key to success in life. Why? the answer is simple just because you are positive doesn't mean that you will accomplish your goals, complete your high school with an advance diploma or even find a job after years in the university, studying a career that you hated but decided to study that because its was the one that it will give you a better future. Therefore, you have to work, study, and move outside of your zone of comfort for you to have a successful life.

You will accomplish your goals with a hard working and diligent attitude. If you just have a positive attitude and maybe your goal is to have a car the coming year let me tell you, that you will not only need a positive attitude your will need a lot of requirements, like find find a car insurance whre you will have to pay monthly and also to the car company if you want a new car from there. After that you will have to work more an your payment will not be that same as before it will be less. Basically what I want to say is that just because you have a positive attitude it doesn't mean that you will have a car of the year, no it's not like that, for you to accomplish your goals you will need a hard working attitude and actually achieve your goals.

You are telling me that if you have a positive attitude you will graduate from high school with a advance diploma? No that is not possible, to graduate from high school is a work that you do for 12 years. And all those years your are telling me that you had a positive altitude? that's is not true, what happen to those days when you were sick in the school and you couldn't go to home because your house was alone and no one could pick you up from school, you thoughts were positive or they were just thoughts about how will you survive until the end of the school day?. Having a positive attitude is not the key for your success in school neither in your life everyone has moments when they want to give up on everything and live in a island were you will not have to support the society that this world has.

After years of studying a career that you didn't like hoping that when you finish you will find a suitable job for you to be successful and help your family. Years of working in a part time, nights of no sleeping, hundreds of essays, homework in the midnight and group projects, sometimes not able to pay the next semester, and a lot more is what a university student has to go for them to have a successful life not a positive attitude. And after all that they have to find a job to start paying their debt with the bank. They have to prove in their interview that they are the best of all those people before and after them.

In conclusion your successful life will come when you accomplish your goals, graduate from high school and university then find your suitable job. And not all the people can have a successful life because not everyone can go to high school neither university and those people live their life everyday hoping for a miracle to come to their life they will have to work everyday hoping that one day they will win the lottery and they will not have to work anymore. Your positive attitude will not take you anywhere.       ",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
761E2670197E,"Self-confidence is really important for people to feel good about their own selves. Building self-confidence may be hard on some students because the way they was raise or the way they are treated by others; Students should be able to build up self-esteem for their own good reasons in life, learning may be hard on some students at first but is just one of the task they have to get through putting a lot of effort in to it wot be that hard getting it done will be; Others may believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards.

There i'll be some difficult times where you will want to give up in life times where you will feel like you just can't do it anymore, but students struggle with their own personal problems but they can get through it all and that is what makes the build-up self-confidence about the risk and task they make in life.",2.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5
7658C61156C7,"According to the Generic_School, that believe that 70% high school students change their mind about what career they want to do after high school. I believe that high schools should never let students choose specific courses because, some of students don't even have in mind what they're trying to do after high school, another reason is that they're way too young to choose something that is going to affect your whole life, my last reason is that students may change their mind and choose another course and the school is not going to let them choose another course.

High school students change their mind all the time we may want to be a doctor today and tomorrow we want to be a barber or wanna go to the army, for example my best friend go to a school like that you have to choose some specific courses so when you get graduate you don't be confused about what you going do in college and he told me that he's trying go to a different school because that school doesn't let him change his courses because he was trying be a firefighter but now he change his mind and want to a doctor.

We high school students are way to young to choose some specific courses for our careers I believe they should make a conference and discuss all that with our parents.

My final reason is because students not really sure about what are we trying do in my opinion they should let us do that on the student's senior year because, on their senior year students have a clear mind set of what they going to do after students graduate, like my other friend that go to Generic_School now he's a senior and he's going to be doctor so the school just want him to take the nurse and biology class.

In conclusion, I believe that school should never let students choose their classes or courses, even though it would be nice if you want to be a doctor for example the school should force you to take doctor's relate classes so you can get use to do things that doctors does.",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0
770541C6A2C1,"Would you like to start your life early?

Graduating is a privilege in general for everyone. Most find it very very important if you want to succeed in life and make great money. on the other hand some many not and find it important and waste of time. I think everyone who doesnt find it important should really think twice. Yes I understand that some classes are better than others, but its all required for one to graduate.

In my opinion i support both sides of the story. Some people want to start their life early some do not. Even if you wanted to graduate early its a challenge. obvious you would have to take extra classes, and to make those up you have a choice to take it during the summer, online, or night school which ever is best. its nice to graduate early because if one goes to college they see that and they think best of you.

On the other hand i do not think it's a good a idea to graduate early. Only if you have the right skills and capability for it. Gradating early is not for everyone some struggle in the normal four standard years of high school. It is not a requirement at all. High school is not a race its preparing you for your future its good to take all the time you need maybe if need to stay in extra year or two.

In conclusion like I said ""I support both sides"" it is not necessary to graduate nor is it a requirement. Graduating early is only for those who already want to go to college or go into the work force. Graduating in the normal four years is grate if you dont know what your going to be yet after high school. There is never no rush. Always take your time its your future. ",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

Although, failure can also bring success, if you move smart. Yes, I agree with Prime Minister Churchill with this statement, it all adds up. This all depends on you're level of enthusiasm. How you can handle failure and just grow, learn from mistakes. Failure can bring success.

In life their is ups and downs. Nothing wrong with that at all. For example, you try so hard at something and still fail. All you can do is too learn and grow from that mistake. This just how life goes. When you have are down bad, just pick yourself up and move forward. Positive attitudes will help a lot. Failure teaches people lessons also.

If you're trying, working hard you are leading yourself to success, you could probably fail at times. Failure is part of life is my point.

(03/10/2020).

The oportunity the not miss one class and be in you house is the best thing the can happen to one school students, this benefist the school and the students beacuse they never going to miss one day of school and the homeworks and tests to. In the actually some kids miss the school for be sicks, some familiar pass away ,they in vacation and they not return in time to the country , they miss the bus school and they can't go to the school beacuse they not have car ,oh they wake up late. This is a benefit because they can learn about the class oh activity and not miss homework oh test and be prepare for the next class in the school, and be in his house relaxing and be in a safe place and always have ready you homework oh test to next class and its ah good benefits to the people ho its in the hospital and can go to the school for ah broken legh oh medical condition .

But not everething it's good about this idea some kids maybe oh actually they gonna stop going to the school and stay in his house and skiping the school. this its going to affect them beacuse they can't sociable with other people ,they can have ah computer oh in his house, they not have wife oh cellfone and other guys oh kids will skip the online class to and go play video games,and they parents are not gonna have idea about what his kid did oh do, and during the test they can copy using this class peapers oh using his fone to find out the answers. ( In my case i will always if they give me the opportunity to online classes i will always stay in my house relaxing in my bed when i listening the class ) but in the end this option of learn in his house have his good and bad bennefits (some school in the united states are not using this becuse they not have personal wedsites and can garanteed if the student are going to use this ) .

( I have one idea in how they can do this in ah good way. The students ho miss the school need to call the school and inform why they not going to the school and need the have a parent in his house, then they send them the link of the online class and notify the parent if they are doing work, oh they are skiping the online classes, and they can have ah limet time of online classes so they can be focus to his work and doit on time and when they are doing ah test they doing the test in a video coferincing with one teacher if they and not chating oh copy during the test. ).

My personal opinion:

In my opinion its ah good offer becouse sometimes i miss the school bus and i can't go to the school becuse i not have ah car and i always miss the class,homework and tests, and this can be help me a lot to have all the work in time and be prepare for the next day of school and be ready take the class oh to take one test .

one sad fact:

In the intere world some kids can have this oportunity to have online classes in some countries around the world they not have the tecnology to do that so if they miss the school one its like they are missing one day of his life and fact even they are kids ho not are going to the school bacuse the parents not have money to send them to the school ( yep in some countries the education cost money and they not have free schools like united states ) and they have to work in one short age to help his family in my country was like this thaks to good i was alow to go to the school thanks to my mother and come her to the united states so when i come to the school her in united states and i hear students said i hate the school and i wanna be in home i remember my country and i said thanks to this country for give me free education (even in her they do video school conferencing to the people ho not coming to the school and i said wow , Even they do that for the students, and the students are doing protest to have more off days so what i try to said is always thanks to you parents for the education they are give to you and thaks always to you country to give you free education to you can be some one in you future and have a nice work and never ask why i not have this. and always think some in around the world not have the stuff the you have and always thanks to GOD for the stuff you have ( I always do that wen i wake up).

Extra fact:

In some countries i the world like China,South Korea,Russia... etc, the education in vidio its ilegaly in all school this is bacuse they think the education its have to be like the oll days paepar pencil and uniform (some schools in united states more in the private schools) and they not use laptops to do classes the have to read every single book and the attendence its obligatory what i read if you miss the school in that countries they punch you in the hands with one metal stinck ( like in some countries in south america) and the leave detention in the school and you have to writte in 10 oh 20 pages the i have to come to the school every day . sometimes they stay in the school all day bacuese they need study for ah test.

777F0E16E55E,"Some people don't know how to play basket ball, Well I have some things that might help you with basket ball or build it or anything with the sport. The frist thing is the enviroment, most people play outside and others play inside, well I think you should play outside mostly on summer days because the enviroment is more cooler or warmer than other months. The second thing you should do is to try not to play in extreme temperature. The thrid thing is make sure its not high winds outside to be cold, this will effect your gameplay for basket ball if its high winds. Fourth thing is the good days to play basket ball, like summer days or sping time. The last thing for the enviroment is the day time and nigth time, you should play in the day time because nigth time you can't see much but in day time you can pretty much see everthing.

Equipment is important for basket ball, so here some things you would need for basket ball. The frist thing is a basket ball, make sure the ball is full of air and a frim grip. When play basket ball make sure the court is large enough for the sport. The court need to be a flat surface for the basket ball not to roll off. The next thing is a pole for the basket, make sure the pole is high enough for the basket and the ball to reach. The basket needs to be wide enough for the ball and a net that is short enough for the ball. The last thing for equipment is the out line of the court, it needs the out line for lineing up shots.

The skill of basket ball is important because of the gameplay is to win the game. Fitness is important for basket ball because it can bring up your stamina. Team work can make the game change from a losing game to a wining game, just by passing the ball to a teammate is important for skill. If you want to be good at the game then practice and trained your shots and make new openings. Strategy is important with teammates to win the game, think of new ways to beat the oppitsite team. Then you have planing, planing ahead is good way of back up plans to prevent losing. People just need to practice and trained if they want to be good at something.",2.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

The students will have a all year they can use. If they graduate one year ealy it would help they in college or after college, it would be helpful for them in their future job too.

The students will be able to experience a early college, and they will be able to take their time to get everything they need for their life after college, it will also help some of them in the job they dicide to do, they will have time to get more experience for their job.

It will give them the time they need to get the diplomats or the dregrees they need for the careers the will chose after college. for the one who will be working after high school, it would give them the time they need to get to know their future jobs better.

78A3B43DFF8E,"Former British Prime Mrimister Winston Churchill once said that ''success consists of going failure to failure loss of enthusiasm. ""Do you agree with of Churchil's statment about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success ? Take a position on this question. Use reasons and specific examples to support your ideas.

Yes I agree.

The Failure in My life.

The failure in the life is just the first step of counsel to success. From experince , I'm saying yes that the failure makes my life better. like when I came America with zero English that was the biggest straggle in my counsel. As emyplee , student and self developing.

Emyplee.

First, as emyplee it was not easy to find job because of English language. So way where was applying for jobs the company require have whether Spinsh or English so I can not speak any of other, for tow year I was just home, job no money to help my family back home because of language

But I did not stop after two years fund a job so I was dishwasher, it was too tough to communicate with my Mangers and employees too. They were making fun of me when I spook English. But that never stop me from what I want to do. Now I'm a superior in the pace I work for it. I did not let the language or anythings else to stop me back from what would me my life best.

School and Study .

Second , as student that was the hardest than that I though . No back round of school like knowledge or education because I never been in the school in my childhood so that made it for me so difficult to understand what the teachers were saying. So another attack of failure in my way, I did not no how to study because there was no one to help me what should I do in that time so fall at school. Because of what other people were saying about me like that impossible that you can go further than that you are now which is can not get high school diploma there were a lot of failure in my life .From failure to a big surprise that I making this year, I will be my graduation form high school and the nest will be collage. Because I do not what let other people make decision of what should I do or not.

Self development

Third was to wake to believe of myself and to make nay decision. there were a lot of pressure no me . I could not focus with what I was doing like school and work and other thing because of people around me. I could not eat well for two years and I got sick. All my families were worry about me. So over and over I fall of everything. And one day I asked one of my friend what you did to be successful in your life. ''she said be yourself and if you are important to yourself that will makes it different''. That word change my life to think positive. Nothing can make me stay a way from what make me successful.

And the end, as human our enthusiasm can make us stronger then failure. We have to look what other people did in the life because of enthusiasm. As human we can learn anyn things that we thought that is hard to learn it.

7A239E4D1966,"My thought on the prompt are that I think it's better to be active. Being active or doing something all the time is good. You can be very helpful by helping people out or doing chores. Doing something all the time can make you physically fit. You can be moving all the time and a lot it can be good exercise.

I like working out or helping people out especially my family. Many people enjoy or like to be active and it makes them feel good including myself. I can'not stay inactive for a long period of time like many people in this world. In some people's life activity play's a major role in there life's. Like a personal trainer or a coach.

Inactivity is sometimes bad especially if you do it for a long time. It can be frustrating to other people if everybody is working but you and they need your assistance. If I'am inactive for a long period of time i can get sick or really anybody if you have been laying around doing nothing for days. Your body needs movement or some type of exercise. That's why it's better to be active.

Therefore, inactivity can sometimes be good or necessary. For example, if you are watching a movie at the movie theater. You can'not be jumping and running all over the place you are going to get kicked out. In some situations when something bad is happening out side your home is better to stay as far away as you can and do'not intervene is better to stay idle.

Finally,I some occasions is inactivity serves a purpose. You do accomplish more if you stay active and you can meat your goals in life if you put hard work and not staying idle.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0
7A68E1FB7863,"Imagine an aboard student come from different country that is far away from United State, so she need a long summer break to return to her country for visit her family. Summer break is what educators and students are looking forward for. Whereas many people argue that the break should be year-round schools, and it should be a 3-4 week break in summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. The summer break should be longer and less short break because students need more time for their vacation, and they will not have to worry the homework that they left at home.

While many people believe that the summer break should be shorten, a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall because the educators feels that if the break too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall, this is a week argument. For instance, a break in the middle of the school year easy to get students forget what they have learn. Further more, students will not want to go back to school after few days off. Students need break but a short break is unnecessary.

To begin with, students are waiting for a long summer break where they can spend all their time at the place that they wish to be at. For example, an exchange student from Vietnam came to United State with her parents for emergrates, but her siblings still live in Vietnam because they were married before sign up. Summer break is the only time that allows the student to go back to her country for visiting. Furthermore, some students are working full time in summer to have a provision for their consumption in the future such as buying a car, college,etc. The part time work that students make during school year does help but not much for preparing or satisfy the claim inside teenager.

In addition, people want to have a relax time on a long vacation, none of the students want to be thinking that they still have work waiting for them at home and the deadline is coming. For instance, teachers love give homework during the break for no reason. Going out with friends but still have to bring paper and pencil to do homework is very humor. Furthermore, some teacher put onerous on students, which they giving out homework and big project for a test grade just because they don't want the student to forget the information that they have learn. Students didn't expect teachers to finish grading their work during the break, but teachers expect them to finish the big project, it is unfair for students.

As a final point, the summer break should be longer because students need more time for their vacation, and they will not have to worry the homework that they left at home. For long summer break teacher don't give homework, and students feel free to plan out their vacation for entire summer. The long break is much better than a short and unnecessary break.

We use technology for online and for our phones. So if we needed to contact someone it would be threw our phones. If we needed something to wear we go online buy something. If we needed go some where the in our phones theres GPS will guide us. We use our phones for lots of thing like looking at the news, or to see what time is it. Our phones has a lot of knowledge so if we need something new we use our technology

We use technology for work like if we needed finish something we know how to do it. If we needed look something up for work we do it threw our technology. If your boss calls you in for something hes using technology. So if we did not have technology we could not do anything that what we are doing today.

We use technology for our school like now Im taking test on my computer. We use technology for learning things like in history we are learning stuff from the past. We use technology for tests and to print some papers out. We use projectors for class if we need to see something. We use technology for our safety like cameras.

So without technology we could not do anything like call or text or shop online or learn. Are lives have changed a lot when technology was invented. Technology is all around everywhere you go theres going to be technology.",3.0,2.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5

So then you ask for more advice. Then at last you all ready know what to do. So you can more. I think u should ask for more help and advice. so you can pick the better choices.

You can get more info on the topic you are doing. Like for one person can tell you one thing and a other person can tell you something else. Thats how you can get some more info. It helps more by asking more people because while you have your info they have there info as will. So then you can have more knoallige about whatever you doing. Last of all it's better to ask more people because like I said you can get more knoallige on the topic and will help you one making the better choices as will. It's all ways good to get more info on your topic because you don't ever want to do something with out any knoallige.

People can help you answer stuff faster. you can probably can get the answer faster by telling more then one person. like for example you are doing some hard work at school and you want the right answer you are not just going to ask one person you are probably going to ask more then one person. All really because everybody thinks different. And last of all ask more then one person can probably get you the right answer. you should other people for help.

you can help you pick the right choices. You can ask some friends or family for some help then it can help you go the right way. But if you do ask a lot of people you can probably can get confused. And maybe get mad and not finish your work. Then you will have no clue how to being aging. But all so all the opinion you got can help you a long way. Because you have gotten so much fact and options you can finish faster.

All Am saying is ask for some help and you can get the right answers and you can probably make some friends too.  ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5
7B5BC2343286,"In some Societies, students are expecting to identify a career by the time they enter to high school,Their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific careers and take the classes they need for the career to practices more and be more specific in the career and have more thinks to know how it work for them, in some career they need a lot of think to try it and they need practice to be in high level of the career and at young age they are expecting what career they want to take when they get older and get to high school.

I think that's good idea for students to commit to a career at young age, because some career are really hard to take it and if they start talking about what career they can take from young age, they would know more about how the career work, and before they get to high school some of them would know what kinda of classes they can take and how it work to get better practice in the career because some career are really hard to take it, but some are not that hard to take it, but in high school they are many classes about careers and they talk about it and it work.

When they get to high school, they can ask what are better courses for this career and what is better for this career and get information. When they are younger they are thinking in many career and they talk to the teacher whats better in this career and what kinda classes they can help and bring up better in the career, When they get to high school the thinking in many more career and getting more ideas about careers and see which one is better and talk about it. and when they get age when they have take classes for the career they getting more ideas about the career.

By the time of the classes they meet someone who knows the about careers and they ask what they need for take classes, and visit the college or make a field trip and meet with the company of the career,

before they get to high school, they trying to be better in every classes they have and have good grades and take important classes that work for the career and trying to take everything what they need for the career and important thinks learning everything.

Most students from young age are thinking in career, when they start middle school are think what kinda of career they can take when they get to high school, and when they get to high school they are looking for the classes about their career, and see what can they do to learn more about what they think in their career and see how can they do to take it, and do the best with their classes to complete the career for their job and take about what they need for the college.

I think that's a good idea to be thinking from young age, so when they get to high school they already know what career they gonna take and what kinda classes they work for their career and be prepared for collage, and from younger age they are learning more about what they wanna be when they get older, When they get to their college they would have more experience with their career, because they start thinking from young and they take course that help for their dreams with the career.

7BBB35F9D1BD,"If I had to take a side I think I would disagree. One reason is that you cant always have success ,there's times where somethings don't work out. Then there's failure and thats how you have success in anything from learning from your failure But there is time where when you fail and your enthusiasm is gone because of that.

The one reason I agree is because there's time that you just cant have success. I have had that in my life in many situations. Once when I was playing soccer we had won all the games and then came to the day where we were playing for first place and we lost and that day all my enthusiasm was gone. I was so mad and just had no energy. I learned that there times that I wont win and times I will it's part of life but along the way I learn new things. Then there school there you do go from failure from failure to success because once you make a mistake and you learn from it and do better next time because your already know now but it does bring your enthusiasm down.

The next reason is that failure does does make you have success but also it make not encourage to keep going. From the first time you fail to the next will will learn something and later on when it happens again that's will you will get it. When you do fail and fail you lose enthusiasm but gain it back when you have success. You feel sad and mad and just not excited no more when you keep failing again and again. So when you fail and fail again you will away lose enthusiasm because you just can't get it.

So if I had to pick a side I would disagree because you cant just fail and fail and then have success and not lose enthusiasm. And I disagree from experience because in my life I fail and never still had enthusiasm after failing maybe some people do but I speak from my point of view.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0
7D94F809823A,"Many people agree, that the use of technology brings a positive impact by allowing people to complete many task like. looking for information, buying a book,

buying video games, and shopping. and looking for technology as a way to communicate which can limit the opportunities to use verbal communication.

I strongly disagree with this statement on the use of technology, because it limits the amount of outside interactions and technology can do everything for you. For example, now people mostly use text as a way to communicate with someone through social media. using only this form of communication can limit the use of verbal communication with a person. Resulting in negative relationships with a person causing misunderstandings and negative relationships. avioding verbal interactions is very bad for somone. Technology can also be damaging for the health.

Technology be both physically and emotionally unhealthy. For Instance the use of so much technology can damage the eyes and can cause brain damage this can result to unhealthy problems in the future. On the other hand people think that by using there phones, tablets and computers. They do not have to be mobile and do a task by themselves with no technology. By sitting around and not getting up to go out and finish a task can lead to loss of energy and many other physical problems. The lack of day to day verbal communication can cause negative emotions. For instance not verbally talking to people can make someone feel lonely and unhappy.

Using technology as a way to purchase things and avoiding to go to the stores can have some negative outcomes. For Example purchasing an electronic on a website and having it delivered it can result to being broken, missing pieces, and can be the wrong thing this can lead to loss of money and can lead to no possible refunds. people use this as way to shop for food, clothes, and books instead of being able to feel the object or know the quality of the item it self or asking an employee about the items pros and cons.

In conclusion, Many people agree that technology allows them to complete many tasks without having to come in contact with others. as a result Technology has a negative impact on people limiting contact with person to person resulting to negative impacts on there day to day life, Although, technology is smart it is always best idea is to be able to do things more off technology and using more verbal communication with a people rather then a phone or computer using verbal communication is a best way to being positive out comes and being able to go to a store instead of relying on technology.

7D955FAD0C73,"Likewise, many people belive that "" Determine never to be idle ... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". By all means that by being idle you wont get much done, but if active can get a lot of more stuff done. Others belive that by being idle, you can still get anything done as much as a person that is consistently active. I strongly agree that by being active will get more tasks complete and it will be less difficult. By always having something to do, your showing everyone your character and your morals. Inactivity and idleness is not good because by not having anything to do you wont learn as much as a person that has to do majority of time. Actively participator have better improved skills then those who dont do anything.

Firstly, being active is the best goal a mind set can have. It will be less likely for one to not complete a task or struggle with a task if is idle. Always doing something no matter if you have nothing to do, shows a lot about someones motivation and actions. Especially in a work place, if your boss sees you doing nothing while there being things to do, hes going to think your inactive. By showing everyone you always have something to do, your showing them that you are capable of doing anything. Theres no task to difficult or no job to big for you to complete because you are already used of always doing something in your everyday life and while being idle from the task isnt part of your expectation or motives. If you think of always being occupied and being successful it practically the same concept just because getting task done is like you doing anything you are asked to do and being successful is like achieving your goals.

Secondly, Idle and inactivity serves a purpose when you are a 100 percent sure you can do anything when asked to. For example my dad once told me, why are you always playing video games and that why dont i go and play outside with my friends. What i told him was that i did not want to and he told me that my actions show a lot about who i am. After that he signed me up for a youth soccer team, that i played being a defender. Although i wasnt good, i started trying my best and being active with the team. Later that day my coach was talking to my dad and telling him how i was participating and doing everything he told me to do. What he also had suggested to my dad was if he can move me up to a left forward because of all the hard work and commitment i had done for the pass warm ups and practice games.

Therefore, people that are always participating you will see improvement in grades, work ethic and body structure. People that always are doing something productive in there everyday life have good grades because they are used of finishing all their work, rather then the student that doesnt do anything and idled from the class. Humans that are always active rather than being idle and isolated have a better attitude and work experience. Going to the Gym doesnt only show that you have an excellent daily routine but you are person that has a goal to complete each and every day. Keeping your self occupied thew out any circumstance is a good skill and shows that you are not inactive and that nothing is excluding you from doing anything you have to do.

In conclusion, do you think always having something to do all the time shows who you really are? Participating shows a lot about a person goals and achievements. Inactive people show their lack of interest and the type of attitude shown. While a person that is consistently doing things and keeping there self occupied and does not tend to complain about what they are ever asked to do. Always doing stuff will make you want to complete more each and every time.",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0
7E530A20DA68,"People and students' have some amazing talents and skills. Talents are very impressing and challenging for an example,people that can juggle with oranges or bottles and people that can sing. Some talents can be very difficult at first and people can give up easily but when people practice and they try they do not give up. The skills and talents I enjoy the most is playing the violin,cooking,and makeup on my own time.

When people play the violin they say It is very difficult and it is very boring. Some adults that have played the violins and the chelos are very talented and their skills are by playing the violin Is just slowly moving the bow towards up and slowly moving it down. When I first played the violin It was not easy moving the bow fast towards the bridge of the violin and knowing the songs that some students' had to play by their self. When I had my first Pyrimid Concert In Elementary school I had a great time playing and learning how to play the violin.

Cooking is another talent that some people like to enjoy while they are home or they help their mom cook. Cooking can be fun and people can experience new kinds of food that they never tried. When I was little I always wanted to cook with my mom and she cooked all different kinds of food like Rice with Chicken,she made Pizza,and also baked Cookies and Inchiladas. They are resturants that have good flavor foods like when people go to the Buffet or to IHOP.When I cook with my mom or my sister I experience that cooking can be hard because people do not know what ingrediants they have to use or the taste is disgusting.

Makeup Is one of the funest. They are some teenage girls that love to do their own makeup or they just do it for fun. A lot of teenage girls start learning how to do makeup by watching on the internet step by step. Teenage girls have really good talents in fashion and using good color shade on thier eye lid. Talents In makeup are fun when people have their own time with their firends when they come over. Some girls feel more comfortable by using makeup and some girls do not. Makeup can be enjoyable and fun to experience.

They are some difficult talents and skills that people give up on. When people experience or find something they like they would like to try it. Cooking Is like a talent where people like to enjoy cooking like the cheifs they make really good food. Makeup is fun to do and it is really amazing when people are a makeup artist and really good at fashion.

7F336F4B9442,"Yes,I agree failure plays in the pursuit of success. Some people when they fail they learn what they did wrong and next time they fix it. If they don't understand or learn from there mistakes. They can't get success in there life. If anyone did any mistake try to fix it. If you can't fix it. Get help from your family or your friends.

When i was in 9th Grade. I don't like math. Because i don't understand math question. I read my question and find mistakes. What i did wrong. Then i fix my mistakes. I do my work again and again. I do my work very hard. I ask my teacher about anything that i don't understand. She help me lat to learn math. Because i did my work hard now i get the success. Now i am good in math.

When i came in United State. I don't Speak and understand English. I made many mistakes to write the work or speak. I try my best and I learn English from my teachers from my friends. Any word i don't understand i look in dictionary. If i can't find word in dictionary i ask my teachers. I speak English at home with my brother and sister they fix my mistakes and its help me to speak better English.

Some people when they loss they don't try it again. Because they think that we are not good at this. Cause of that they can't get success. peoples who are around them they need to help them motivate them so they can try it again. like Sport coaches motivate there team before they match. When someone motivate other they get energy to do something. Don't be afraid to loss next time try with more power. Everyone loss in there life and they learn from that.

Reasons why people fail. Because no one understand them so they think that no one care about them. people need to understand other problems and help them. Tell them that you make this mistake try to fix this and you will be better.

When someone break his/her leg. Then he/she is so afraid to walk. because he/she think that it's very painful. Then someone help his/her put his/her hand on the shoulder. Then they slowly slowly put weight his/her leg. Like this you don't need to lose enthusiasm in your life. When you feel failure see other people read about them that how they fight when they fail.

Many American famous people loss in there missions but they don't loss there hope. They try it again and now we are read about them. Because they did many things. Thats help us make easy and fast to do our work or travel. Like Airplane, Electricity, Computers, Cars, and many others things.

Some people fail in there life. They try again but still they fail. So try something else that easy for you and you can make your life better. Like if you are not in a basketball try soccer or baseball. which one is easy for you. Choose that and do hard work on that. practice every day don't be lazy.

I want to say that do what ever do you want to do. But do that you are good in and easy for you. If you like another thing thats hard for you. do hard work on it and make easy for you.

7F4706C105DE,"Do you agree with Churchill statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? Yes because in order for you to be successful you have to fail a couple of times. For an example when

I was 10 years old I lived in Miami Florida and I played football. Every kid I went up against they were faster than me and better and I got mad because I was not good enough. One day the coach pulled me after practice and told me what's up this is not the kid I saw play football in Miami Beach. He then matched me up with the best receiver he had and I still didn't surprise him with that kid he saw on the beach.

After a while of training and training back to back coach then matched us up again now I was faster and better it got to the point where I was his star receiver that season we finished 10-0. We went to playoffs and finished 5-0 coach was really happy in 10 years of coaching he had never achieved something like that with his football team. But it was the final game everything changed the team we went up against had stronger and bigger players they first took out are running back with a neck injury so that left me playing two positions. We were up 21-7 its second half 2 minutes before half and next thing you know I had both tight ends and safety hit me at the same time both tight ends hit me in my knee and I was done. What hurt the most was seeing my coach not being able to concentrate he had then even left the special team coach run the plays all because coach went to check on me.

He asked the doctors was I okay and they said he is done he cant play neither can he walk. After that coach went outside mad he was really mad and he then saw the score board it said 28-7. We were still up than theres the halftime coach talks to the players even I did so and they go back on the field we are on the 40 yard line and next thing you know boom are star quarter back is hit. He is not getting up his spine was broken and he could not even move after that coach knew we lost the game but coach did not know that i was feeling better without coach knowing i wen't back on the field the score is 28-28 theres 30 second left and the ball is on the 50 yard line. Coach starts to see the formation he than knew I was on the field and he tried calling timeout but there was no time out left coach knew I could throw but the team did not know my friend Ricky is running he cuts back and runs back up the field as fast as he can I throw the ball he catches it on the 10 yard line and he gets the touchdown coach than ran on the field and picked me up.

Coach then said how did u manage to hold in all the pain after being hit like that I told him the same way my brother managed to cover me when there was a drive by and he was shot 9 times. Coach knows I came from a rough spot in Miami especially the projects. Now i am 17 and i learned from my passed i learned from being a failure for you to be able to be great you gotta fail no matter what nobody is perfect. My brothers always told me if you eat okay now you will eat better tomorrow it is a saying just about being able to actually grind and stay humble. sometimes in life things will not always be easy because that is just the way things are and i personally will be better from yesterday.

How do you think all the star people from now and days have so much money they were not good from the jump they failed a lot in life nothing will never come easy to be great you gotta beat the great. Football players dont just get to be star just like that they gotta earn it. Rappers dont get to get platinum just like that they gotta make good songs. Everything in life is a sacrifice you gotta humble yourself and be able to go out and get it because nothing will be bought to you. you can feed a horse but you cant force them to eat it.

7FF600C1F829,"There are some young teenagers that already know a specific career they want to follow after finishing high school. Some teenagers have planned to go to college after high school and some have planned to start with a job. However, there are also some teenagers that dont have any future plans and they dont care about it. In today's societie, Schools expect students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. To help that, high schools offers many courses to help their students identify a specific career and to also guide towards them.

Starting with the disadvantage of choosing a specific career at a young age. Of a young child, it's dream career is to become a policemen or policewomen, firemen or firewomen, a actor or actress or even an astronaut. By the time the young child gets older, it's interest changes in many categories such as their dream job. Starting as a freshmen in high school, students have a big and a open mind to almost everything and so they think they already know what they want to do after high school. However, after time passes, students will learn and experience new stuff in school and out of school, and they might get to know different intreset, and opinions of their friends and classmates. Those could change a young teenagers mind and interest easily. Therefore, some students will change their courses over and over again, till they final identified a career that they really like, and enjoy. However, some other students get tired of chasing a career they once dreamed of, that they change every school year and get lazy or dont care anymore.

Another disadvantage would be that students only concentrate on their future careers and focus on their difficult classes they take, and this might sound confusing because, that is the reason why students go to school, however only focusing on work doesn't mean it's healthy for a young teenager. Taking school not seriously is not the point here, however taking school work too serious ""For the good of the students future"" can cause serious damage in important relationships, such as the relationship between a child and his or her parents could be damaged because, the child has to much pressure on his or her mind and if his or her parents interrupt, a fight between parents and child would break out. Another problem would be that the young teenager will have difficulties making friends or has difficulties to talk to other classmates about anything besides school. During the teenagers free time, the teenager wont go out and play with his friends or maybe he doesn't have any and stays at home playing video games. That's why some parents disagree with today's societies. The reason why is because, they don't like that the schools expects students to identify a career by the time they enter high school, saying that the schools should give the young teenagers time to experience and learn new things before they have to chose what they want to be in the future.

However, not all students feel the same way as the other students. In fact, many students already know what they want to do after school and appreciate the opportunity to chose specific classes. Students can better concentrate on specific class to help them and guide them towards their dream career, of course there are other classes that have to be taken, in able to graduate however, students still have the opportunity to chose specific classes. Besides having a great opportunity to get helped and prepared for their future, is that young teenagers will have more fun in class that in regular class. The reason why is because, they will have more fun working on something that their interest in then working on other class work. Making friends will also be a lot easier, because the students in the same class will have the same interest and maybe the same opinion.

Choosing a specific career that they want to follow, at a young age is big step, in fact it's maybe a to big of step for a young teenager. However, there are also many young teenagers that already identified a career that they want to follow, it pretends on how the young boy or young girl acts, motivation and working speed.

It would be better to give the young teenagers a little bit more time to think about the future and maybe to just let them experience new things and learn more about our societie, so at the end they have a clearer view on what is going on and what they maybe will be in the future, so they can better prepare themselves. However, the optional courses should not be change and they should be stay like that because, they are very helpful and perfect to prepare and guide the students towards their dream career.

As we all can see there are many pros and contras to this subject that could be disgust and argued about. Those were my .",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5,4.0

Wilnston churchill, he say that success in life or anyother things, theres a failure and don't lose enthusiasm because of that litlle things or because you fail one time in your try.

I agree with the minister churchill say because succsee it's a way to improve your skills or be betther in what you did and you try to not haves more make mistakes annymore, success can have failure but also you can lern for them, and learn how to rersolve your pronlemsand see how far you can go by trying, how you can have more expiriense by traying and traying again and again, no making mistakes annymore so the next time you don't have the same mistakes or pronblems because you larn about it.

I think with success you can learn a lot of experiance in your life, because with your failure you learn about it, because if you leave it like that you not trying and you are not exploing your self, so if you exploit your self you can see how far you can go to resolve the problems or the mistake you have.

So if you explod your self trying more and more you can maybe resolve the problem or see how far you can go to find a solution, the thing is if you keep trying your best in somthing you don't know exacly what it is or how to resolve it in many times you can find a solution and fix it.

failure is not you are not going to resolve it because if you are doing your best but you keep failure is becuase you need to find the problem you are not seeing, to resolve it failuture is not because is not working success is because you didn't find the solution at your problem.

For my conclusion for success you have to pass for a lot of problems and mistakes so you can find a solution for it, in your life if you don't explow your self you won't know what was the problem to that but if you explow your self you can find the solution and also learn from that, trying hard and hard moust of the times you can find a solution for evryting and that is how you also you can help others with they problems like when they say two heads is better then one.",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.0

First of all,some students when offered distance learning will not pay attention to their lessons. They will distracted either by their cell phones or electronic devices. And we all know students always like to be on their cell phones at anytime and anywhere. Also,Students can be distracted either by their parents or siblings which may cause them lack behind ahead of their lessons. So when all of this happens , students may be delayed which will cause them to fail and waste of time. For example,my cousin came to the United States of America with his siblings and he was permitted to to take one of his subjects or courses online. And anytime he gets home,he doesnt get a peace of mind because of the disturbances and worries from his siblings. Due to this,he fell apart in his studies which caused him to fail the course.

Another reason is that,some students finds it difficult and boring to learn on their own pace. Because they encounter a lot of problems in their studies. Students finds it very hard to understand lessons without the presence and explanation of a teacher. And again,students finds it very boring when learning on their own because there is no form of oral conversation between the teacher and student. Some students prefer being active in studies rather being dull or inactive. So when all these happens,the students may skip the contents because he or she doesn't get any understanding,

or close the contents and go to sleep. For instance,I had a friend who was struggling with these same problems,he feels bored and difficult to understand in distance learning. So anytime he gets to sit for the lessons,he feels sleepy during a short period of time. He sometimes drink a whole cup of thick coffee but it doesn't make any changes. So what he does is to off the computer and go to bed. And this hinders his academic performance each year.

Lastly,students feel fatigue or weak in distance learning since they don't get time to take rest after school. Some students even have to close work after school before taking the online class. With these,it makes student lazy and sleepy when he or she sits in fronts of the computer to learn. And me myself is experiencing this problem. When school closes, I have to walk half a mile before I gets home,and from there,I work on my assignments and take my shower. So by the time I will be done,then it is getting late, and I still have to take this classes online. I feel tired in learning at times which retards my level of learning.

From these reasons, I would like to conclude that,students would not benefit from distance learning because there are so many disadvantages from it which has brought low level academics in their studies.

In my soccer team, I have practice everyday, after school. Sometimes

I don't feel good to practice,

because the food was not heath to my body or it wasn't enough. My team mates told me that they bring their own food because the lunch menu of the school do not like them, and they are tired to eat the same food every single day

Some students have to go out to buy healthier food.

Another reason why the lunch menu should be change is because an healthier lunch, keeps you awake and with energy. Some student need to eat health because they are in school teams. Also, sometimes you feel tired when you are studying. you feel that your stomach hurts and feel that something is wrong with your body, you feel sleepy, sometimes hungry, and you can not concentrate in the class. For example, I have Personal Fitness on my last period, when I eat my regular lunch menu, I feel tired and sometimes I don't want to do anything because I feel my body too heavy. My doctor, told me that I have to eat healthier. Since, when you are growing up, your body needs food that help it.

A change of the school menu could be beneficial for all of us. An healthy body, stronger, and with good aptitude. Our health, depends on all of you.

Some may disagree with the quote because there is nothing else to learn .

When I was in first grade I came to school not knowing any English. Honestly I felt isolated because the language barrier I did not know what the teacher was telling me. All I said was ""Yes"" and ""No"" thats all I knew. I think it was a few weeks later that they call my parents . They notify my parents that

I was not doing well in school. My mother as always told me practice makes perfect. My mother with little bit of English that she knew she helped me to perfect it. Now, I could speak both languages fluently because of that effort I have more opportunities for a better job .

In Christmas the year 2017, I got the probably the best and worst gift of my life. It was an X box one at first felt happy because it was my second gaming console, but I did not know how to use it. It took me two weeks to understand the full operation. Then when I starting playing the first game that I bought was Fifa 18 by the way I did not pay for the game it was my dads credit card.

After that I downloaded Fortnite it was free so I didn't get in trouble . I found the games difficult , I started to practice a lot , then a few weeks later it became an addiction. I couldn't focus in school my grades were falling off where I had them before I got the X box one. My father told me if I did not get better grades he be forced to take away . So I started to focus on my grades ,but yet still thought the gaming console .

Some may disagree that what Ralph Waldo wrote. For example, if your'e a teacher you probably know what to teach for the semester. The job you have does not require that much only a master degree. Or being a car washer you just clean cars.

83165647126E,"One way to improve student achievement is to create a homework club. I think making a homework club is wonderful for students a homework club can help students improve their grades,have more free time,

less tired from school, and grateful to turn to that and get help from teachers and students at the same time.

First, of all, establishing a homework club is creative because it helps students improve their grades. Students get more work done when teachers and other students are helping them. They also, get to study more and don't have to worry about failing the test. Lets say a student is having difficulties on a question on their homework. A student can stay after school and get help with the questions they have trouble with or needs help with.

Also, students have more free time after school. Students have the ability to spend time with their family and friends, and go places. A homework club sounds like a club i would join because after i come home i'd relax or go out or hangout with some friends. if i joined a club like that i'd be happy because i wouln't be the only one who struggles on work and we could help each other out on work we don't understand.

Furthermore, A homework club helps students less tired. They don't need to worry their grades being bad because they had help from teachers and students. They get to sleep more and wake up the very next day and get ready for school. Students should have it easy because theses days students go through so much in life. Just imagine what their going through right now.

Next, Homework clubs and help students on many different things but at least they learn something new. Everyday Students these day try and try the best they can but they lose hope because they feel like they can't do anything. I

believe every student has the courage to get something they done just like that.

Finally, I think creating a homework club is great for the students because it helps students improve their grades, give them more free time when they get home, less tired from school, and grateful that they have this club.

840D73A3804A,"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? I believe that if we do more, then we get more things done. I say that because if you just do what you're gonna say, rather than talking about it, you can get very far in life, and you will be successful. You know why? because you're a action taker, and not just a dreamer, who just expects stuff without the hard work. You also get more noticed, and people will like to be around you, because you're more active, and you're more unique, than most people.

My first reason is that if you just put that action into movement, then you're powerful already. No one can stop you, because your mindset is on a whole new other level. People can't ketch up to you, and people will be jealous of your success. You will have haters. Hate on you, but don't let that slow you down! keep doing, and achieving and great things will come down to your way. For example:There is a saying that If someone is hating on you, then you're doing something great, if they're not hating on you, then you're not doing anything really.

My second reason is that you're a type of person willing to do anything to achieve your goals. You will let nothing in your way. You are ready to grab life by it's neck, and just yank it, cause it's yours. You gotta take over your life now. Don't wish, and wait. Start now, and don't let stuff handed to you. You gotta work for it, and just love the process. Trust me you will not regret it, if you just start making good habits for yourself. For example: doing your homework, and stop procrastinating on the stuff you need to do, or want to do, doing tasks when you don't feel like it. You will be great, and you'll thank yourself in the future.

My third reason, and final reason is you get more noticed, and people will like to be around you, because you're more active, and you're more unique, than most people. Ah, yes nobody likes a person that's just ""normal"". I find that quite lame, and boring. They would like a person that is quite different, and not the same as everybody else you know. For example: You wouldn't want to meet the same people every time now would you? of course not. You would want to meet different people, and find new things, and also most importantly learn new stuff by different people. You would want people with different personalities, not the same ones, as that would be boring. You are more active, than just sitting down. You are taking your chances, and not blowing it. You are taking advantage of life, than just wasting it. Nobody wants to hang out, or deal with someone that is just negative all day, or a loser. They would want to hang with someone that is quite active, respectful, and successful.

My conclusion: Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? I believe that if we do more, then we get more things done. I say that because if you just do what you're going to say, rather than talking about it, you can get very far in life, and you will be successful.

I just want to start this letter by telling you a little bit more about my interest towards your company . As a matter of fact, the day I heard about the oportunities our school were giving to some students to be able to visit some companies. I absolutely want it participate, Because I want to develope more practice and skills about the job I would want to have when I get out of Collage .

Farther more, I'm very interest to work for a Microsoft company that has being my dreams sinse the day I started using computers and I would want it create something that can help others and create new technology for future Generations. However in my school theres not a lot of programs or clases about computer management or software programing, that could help me and other students to improve our nolage about computer Software. I would want to learn more and get more experience about crearting and fixing computers.

For sure woking at a Microsoft company is what I want to do for a living. Also allowing me to come and visit one of the companies would help me undertand what I'm going to be facing in the future when I start working for a big company

For example, what is exactly the job I'm going to be doing or what job I be able do enjoy doing , or what is going to take to get there etc.

If you allow me this oportunity I can show you my skills and you can see and judge me by my job or what I can do. I belive I can be caplabe to do very creative work and come up with ideas in a matter of seconds to improve new producs. And this oportunity can help me figure out what other type of work i can be able to do.

I appreciate the oppotunities your companies are giving to our school and other schools in general, but now I would want to know if you could give me chace and the privilege to come to one of your companies and learn more about Microsoft Programing and computers. I believe I can apport a lot to this company.",3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5
85D3E5A1D64E,"Students chould not be required to take a music, a drama or an art class. Student should only be required to take classes that they actually need. Having to take those classes just adds classes you need to graduate. It is also all a waist of time if the students are not actually in to it.

Firstly, these classes are just extra classes that we dont really need. In my opnion, I believe that student should be able to graduate highschool with the classes they need. English, Math, History and Science are all classes that can support them when they go to college. If student don't take these classes they may also graduate ealier then they are supposed to. For example, I go to a highschool where I get the credits I need and I am able to graduate a year earlier. Which I think everyone should have the chance too.

Lastly, if a student is not interested in one of these classes they won't try. Even if they do try and fail then its just holding them back. They will start stressing over it when they won't actually end up needing it. Student will also consume most of their time bringing up their grade in these classes that they will not work on other classes. Then they will end up failing.

On the other hand, some might say these classes should be required because student might find interest in one of those and would like to persue it after graduating. I think that if a student is interested then they should be allowed to take the class of your choice. However, if your not then you should not be pushed to take them when you dont want to.

In conclusion, student should not be forced to take elcective classes. If they want to they should but if not then they shouldnt need it to graduate. Electives are just extra classes needed to graduate and they also have no pont if the student are not actually interested. po p",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0
863550AEB938,"I agree, they should adopt the 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew. Parents wouldn't be worrying all the time, kids would be focusing more on school, and curfew could teach kids how to be more responsible. Teenagers mostly want to go out and have fun with their friends. Teens are more outgoing when their around their friends. Teenagers might even be disrespectful to their parents if they don't let them go out. Teenagers should feel more grateful because of this curfew law.

Parents are mainly worried about where their children might be because nowadays there are so many things going on in society and we might not even know. That's why parents would feel like it's a great idea for the city council to put this new law. When parents let their children go out with their friends they usually tell them a time they may go and a time to come back. Most of the time kids don't even listen to their parents and they just come back at whatever time they want, but if they put this law parents wouldn't feel as worried as they usually do when they let their children go out. Kids would actually listen to what their parents are telling them and not just leave and come back at whatever time they want like if they didn't have parent's. Society now is really dangerous compared to back then because theres a lot of kidnapping, even killing teenagers. Now the fact that they brought this law parents might start to feel relived because they know that if their children are out on the streets after ten p. m. then they will get caught by the police and they'll have to face their actions.

If they put the 10 P.M. curfew law. Kids would go home early to their parents. Kids would go to sleep early. If teenagers would go to sleep early they would be getting a good night sleep and also they would probably not be falling asleep in class most of the time and actually paying attention in class. Teenagers sometimes think it's not important to learn like if it isn't important. Thats why they go out with their friends and forget theres even school the next day, but their wrong. We indeed need school to educate ourselves and so we can be a better person in the future. There are so many things teens can avoid so they can focus in their school and grades, but sometimes we make poor decisions by not listening to the adults.

Curfew teaches teens to be more responsible. They learn how to manage time and see if they can make it on time because if they don't. They know their going to get in trouble. Teenagers shouldn't be in the streets after 10 P.M. and if they are then its probably not something good their doing. Teens could avoid getting in trouble by the cops or anything by simply going home. Sometimes teenagers like to learn the hard way instead of the easy way. If they don't listen after they've been told a million times then they have to face their consequences. Teens should look at this new law as protection from not getting hurt or anything harmful.

In conclucion, If they choose the ten p. m. curfew hopefully teenagers start listening and respecting the time their parents want them home. Hopefully theres a change in teenagers learning in school, and on how responsible they are. Hopefully they know how to manage their time around their friends and not get in trouble. They should be more considerate about how much their parents worry about them every time they go out and anywhere they are at. At the end of the day this is only doing the best to help teenagers from being in any type of trouble. ",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0

Let's say you fail a test and you have a really bad adtuided and you asked many people what could you do to help and what they say can make you feel better which causes you to have a better a adtuided. Having different perspective also gives you different opinion.

Advice also helps the community. It is proven that when advice is given the community becomes better. I believe that the community can become better when given advice. Part of becoming a better community is teaching others how they can become better. I think that this can be done with giving others advice.

Advice needs to be spread all over the world and to make all our communities a better place. Advice can not only impact the community but the world as well

87692B9A8184,"Have you ever felt that the weekend isn't enough? that you might wanted to do some kind of activities during weekend, but the time wasn't enough. I bet that you did it, and I'm going show you my point of view of why we should keep having a normal school week of five days instead of a four-day school week.

Although some say that my school should adopt a four-day school week by adding two hours each day. Actually, my school should not adopt that kind schedule, because the standard week with eight hours each day increases the productive time, and the standard week allows student to do other activities after school, such as: work, to do homework, sports or even spend more time with family and friends.

Those who believe that the school should changed their schedule from standard five-day work week to a different schedule model that consists of ten hours per day have their reasons. They think that weekends aren't enough and they really need and extra day off to cover their needs. They also think that two extra hours each day are not a big sacrifice, knowing that they are going to have an extended weekend and making the same amount of hours which means the same paycheck amount, and they might have time.

One reason why the school should not changed their schedule of five-day school week to four-day school week is because, the standard week of five days increases the productive time of each student. In this case students might feel tired of being ten hours in school, and at the end during the last period of class they wouldn't pay attention to the class, because they would feel to tired of had spent almost half-day in school. As example of this is myself. If my school adopt this new policy, I wouldn't be able to keep my grades high and I wouldn't pay attention to the last period of class, because by that time I would be tired and bored of have stayed that long and having classes the all day. Therefore the schedule of five-day school week should not be changed.

Another reason why my school should keep its schedule of five-day school week is that, the standard week of five days gives the opportunity to do activities after school, such as: work, homework, sports or spend more time with our families. A perfect example of this is my friend, PROPER_NAME. PROPER_NAME goes to school, but he lives alone. So, he pays rent, his cell-phone payment and food. Then, he really needs to work after school to pay himself. If our school changes the schedule of five-day school week that each day is formed for eight hours, instead having a four-day school week of ten hours per day, but having an extra day off. PROPER_NAME would be involved on a problem, because he wouldn't be able to have a job after school. Therefore my school should not change

its schedule of having five days of school.

Based on the reason that I gave, it's clearly to see that having four-day school week offers good benefits that the regular standard weed of five-day does not give, but I strongly believe that the five-day school week is way better then the four-day school week. Although some say that my school should adopt a new kind of schedule that some business are implementing called four-day work week that consists of extending the school day two hours. Actually, my school should not adopt this new idea, because the standard week formed by five day of eight hours increases the productive time, and it allows student to do different kind of activities like have a job, homework, play sports or even share time with family. Therefore four-day school week should not be accepted in my school. ",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0
87694700310E,"First impressions is always something that i pay attention to when meeting a person for the first time. I will always agree with the fact that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Why? imagine meeting a person and the only thing you think about when they cross your mind is the way they first greet you or the way that they introduced themselves to you.

For instance, in my opinion, i feel that people will always put on a different character for their ""first impression"". For example, calling a job for a interview is something you'd want to change your normal character into a more formal and nice responsible person. You can never change your very first thought of someone, it may change later but not the first second of your conversation. Another example could be is getting someone introduced to you from a friend. On the other hand, there's always an ""i wonder"" question in my mind about everyone, because it's totally normal. When meeting someone new there is many of ways people act towards you. They may act shy and make you feel awkward, or they may act friendly and make you feel welcome. So, with that saying, you can never change the way you first think of someone, first impressions will always be a permanent statement that your brain can't erase.

Accordingly, if you do have the abilities, you can always tell what type of person they are. With just one impression someone can teach you about themselves a bit, theres no doubt in that. It's fun of how our brains permanently label people from our first impression until it is changed to something else. For example, imagine seeing some person that is always quiet, always seems like their mad or doesn't want to be at the function. What first impression would you get from that person? I would honestly not even bother to talk to them, they could say anything mean to me, But with first impressions changing overtime, you never know once that person starts talking they wont stop smiling or talking. You never know truly about something until you experiment it.

In conclusion, the first day of school where you have to introduce yourself, or being at public place and someone asks you for something in a nice way, what do you think about that person? From first impressions, after seeing that person for the second time you would always go back and think about how the first time went. While getting to know them that same thought changes about them because now you truly know who they are. The first times will always be different than the regular times. I will always agree that it is impossible for first impressions to change because of our natural human traits.             ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

People should make there own decisions, Because, As a self reliant person, making a decision based on someone else's advise can be very risky. For example, buying an insurance plan, going based in someone else's coverage will cover something you dont need, while if chosen based on your needs there wouldnt be a problem.

Self reliance is very important for person to become independent. If one dose not trust themselves how will they grow. for example, A famous quote by Micheal Jordan say's ""You miss 100% of the shots you dont take"". this quote eludes to the fact that as an individual it is important to have self confidence in their decision making, because if you dont take a risk in making your own decision you will 100% miss the shot's you take.

Furthermore Making o's own decisions are important ,because, People will not always be there, and you will be forced to make your own decisions. For example choosing your own apartment isnt anybodies else's job but yours. Choosing an apartment is very important and one must have self reliance in order to make the right decision for them selves.

I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Distance learning students attend classes on time by online. Distance learning students also attend to school everyday. By way online you can attend to classes from anywhere.

First, distance learning students attend classes on time by online. In many states students live far from schools. Sometimes they can't be on time because of highway traffic. Sometimes cause of bad weather you have to drive slow than speed limit. And you can be late for school. If they late in every first classes they might fail that classes. Suppose they use the online conferencing they can be on time in every classes.

Also, attend to school everyday. Even if you sick for a week you still able to attend to school everyday by way of online or video conferencing. If weather is such a bad you can't go out of the house still able to attend classes from home. Although none is home to drop you off to the school. You can attend school by way of online or video conferencing.

Then, By way online you can attend to classes from anywhere. You can join to the class even if you go to your friends house. Also if you plan to go out the state for few days you can attend to classes from there. Students can enjoy also they can study. They're able to work in online.

88FCD4D35128,"That some schools offer the option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think that this option is a really good idea for the students. This option can benefit many students that cannot attend schools in the regular schedule. Many students don not have the resources, time or for others personal reasons to attend schools and this option can be helpful for them to finished the studies.

Online classes. This is one of the option for those students that want finished the schools. This option can help them. They can take the classes from theirs home without go to the school and according the time that they have. Time can be a really impediment to attend school, a lot students that leave schools is because they have to work after school and they do not have enough time to do homework or other school activities. They start falling their classes and at the end they diced to leave the school and go to work. Because they may have to feed their families. Family and money can be other reason why the guys leave school some of then came here and don not have any family. so they have to studied and work at the same time to get some money to sent back to their families. But now with this option they can continue with their studies.

The other option can be the video conferences. This option also is a good idea to keep studying. Like online classes this also you can take it from your home any time that you want or depend the schedule that the teacher give you. Because on this option you are going to be taken classes in real time with teachers, that you will see each other by camera. This option can be helpful because while you are taking the class, you can talk to the teacher and ask about something that may be confuse you, and keep practice with him like you was in a school classroom.

One thing that make this great is that wile you are studying you can keep work and doing personal activities that you usually do. and the good of this program is that not only work for young people, adult also can attend this courses and finished their high school. Because other reason why people leave school is because they are over age or too old to go high school. But with this option you do not have that problem because this involve all people.

As we know in this time more and more teenagers are leaving the school. Some of then because do not have other option and others just because they are lazy. But now that the schools are providing this option many student that left school and other people can be benefit with that, and be a easy way for a lot students to finished their studies at get a better future.

I think that if more schools provide distance learning as option for the student, more people can get involve and be benefit with this program, and get better opportunities on their life. Because now that the school are doing this is not excuses to not finished the school.                      ",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
894C9DC473A0,"Albert Einstein said "" Imagination is more important that knowledge"" do I agree with Albert Einstein or do i disagree I picked agree and I'm going to tell you why I picked it.

Reason one imagination is all about being creative like thinking about stuff to do and stuff to wear and writing a song you got to use your imagination and speaking you got to use your imagination just to know what your about to say before you even say the word.

Reason two Albert Einstein used his imagination to be really smart and creative. Also people who invented stuff they used their imagination and not only that they made millions just by using there imagination, and construction workers got to use there own imagination just to construct a big buildings and houses.

Reason three you can make money from just using your imagination I seen people make lots of money just selling stuff they made at there own homes and seen so many companies go from not making anything like money to being this really large company that made millions just from using there imagination.

89506A98AC2B,"People say, having a positive attitude is the key to a success in life.

I strongly agree with them, if you come to think about it been positive may give you the corage to do surtend things.

You would belive in yourself and most possiblie make your goals come true.

It also would be hard for you to get your feelings hurt.

People wont be able to brake you down that easily.

So in my personal opinion, having a possitive attitude actually is the key to a success in life.

When i said it gives you the corage to do surtend things i mean it.

Because, you might want to make a goal in you life come true, but your probably to shy or your thinking ""oh theres no way im going to make it"".

Thats the main problem, you have a negative energy witch bring you to have a negative action.

Sometimes your words reflect your actions.

This is why i think if you have a possitive attitude you will sucess in life.

Been positive or having a positive energy is like the meaning of ""faith"".

Lets talk about why i mention ""faith"".

Having faith makes you believe in yourself'

When you have a negative attitude your of course going to have a negative action.

But in many religions if you have faith everything is possible.

This is why i compare these two words, that are very similar to each other.

So if you have ""Faith"" you must have a possitive attitude.

Having a positive attitude can help you out emotionaly too.

If your possitive at all times no matter what people say about you it wont hurt you as bad.

The reason i belive it wont hurt you as bad is because, you would believe in your self and wont let other negative attitude ruin yours.

For example, if i say to myself ""Man i alredy know i aint going to pass this test , i aint even going to try"".

Oviosly im going to fail because, having a negative energy reflects not to even try.

So if you want to sucess in life like i do, you should try to change your attitude and try been positive at all times.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5
898A8417D70E,"Do you know that 80% of students that goes to the after school program and received more extra help succeeded more than the students who didn't go? After school program helps students that needs more help to succeed, pulls up students grades, and they will have extra time to complete missing work and home works.

If a student wasn't available in a class and missed the class lesson;They would have the opportunity to stay after school with their teachers and learn what they missed and complete their missing work that they haven't done in class. Students stay after to study with their friend and teacher for the test and receive help on difficult lessons by that grades will increase for students that will make them succeed in the future. And it's a better way for teachers to explain the lesson without interrupting the class and make other students confused.

Having you missing work done at school might be hard to do in classes but by having the after school program you will have the time to complete them with your teacher and your friends and taking more help by asking the teacher about what you don't understand. Sometimes some students needs more time completing the tests or the quizzes so the only way to complete them is staying after so they won't lose points and grades.

On the other hand some students think that staying after is a waist of time and you won't receive any benefits, and some dont care if they have missing work or classes they missed ,but its all wrong staying after is a much better way for pulling grades up its a really big opportunity that teachers give their own time to their students by complete missing work, making the teacher explain the lesson again to the students to make them understand the lesson and what its talking about so they won't be confused or fail the class.

In retrospect after schools programs is big good opportunity that most schools provide for students to receive that extra help from teachers to complete what their missing to make students succeed in school and pull up their grades thats why we should persuade students to go after school for help, that's why I'm base with school programs.",4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0

I really want to see the fancy cars that Italy make's like the Lamborghini or the Ferrari an the Alpha Romero or other car that i normally dont see here were i live. I also want to know more about their culture. i wan to learn their language i want to eat their food i want to know how they live if ts ruff or easy or even both. I really want to eat the real Italian food! i always wanted to see if their would be a difference. One other main reason i want to come is for the tours, i want to get on the cannou then paddle and ride the whole channel.

The reason why i really wan to see the fancy cars is because i have a big thing for cars. Ever since i was a little kid my dad will always talk about cars and i'll always be with him ill play with toy cars and and when ever i see i nice car i always call it out saying ""thats my mustang gt"" or ""thats my supra"".

When i grow up i'm going to be a car guy like him. Another reason why i want to go to Italy to see the cars is because were i live you would see a Ferrari like once every 1-2 years and over in Italy seeing a Lamborghini must be like seeing a mustang. so that is why i want to see the luxury cars.

I really want to know how their culture is. i want to know how life is over their i want to see if their kind or mean. i want to learn their language so i can talk with them. To me learning their language or understand it will be an easy thing to do. I think it will be easy because Italian and Spanish language is closely the same. I just don't want to be in on part of the country i also want to go to other places because i know that their are different cultures around the country.

I mainly want to try the real Italian food i dont want to be eating the American version of Italian food. I want to see if their a difference of the the foods i want to know witch one tastes better or if they taste the same. thats what i want to know about their culture.

Another thing that i want to do over their is go in tours. i want to go on tours because when i see on the TV shows, movies, and commercials i always say ""im tryna go their!"". I also want to go to tours over their because i can see the cultures and how places look their. When i go on tour i find out stuff that i didn't know about and finding about new thing is good for your brain. I also always wanted to go to the cannel waters and ride. ever since i was a little kid i would see that people would ride on the cannel waters.

Nothing can make you stronger then failure. It make's you more success In life, even helps you to learn a life lesson, that you can do much more then what you could image to build your life and happens.

However If you did something learn you mistake lesson to not do It again and forget the mistake.

However, It's not good to have failure some people can't handle It so they kill them self. On the other hand, failure Is good because they know how strong and powerful thy are and nothing can break you or failure you.

Attending to school can have a huge impact in your life. How would it affect you, if you don't atten to school?. would it be the same if you learn all the materials by watching videos?. would you be able to ask questions just the same way other students do?. Making a decision of taking class from home can make a huge impact in your life and the future. For example a high schooler that takes classes online that wants to be a history teacher they can struggle a lot because a video can't give you enough information, for you to know the story. a video only summarize the story comapring to when you're in class you can ask questions and also have more information from your teacher. Having a teacher explalining you everything and working with other students can help your grade and also your GPA for you to attened to good collages and be able to have a lot of advantages.

Students will have more benefits and advantages of learning the materials, if they atten to school. students will also have good grades and apportunities for them to get a scholarship and have a higher GPA that would help them attened the collage they want to go to. For example if students don't have a high GPA, the most common thing that would happen would be that they will be rejected by a lot of collages. Having a high GPA can help you get into good collages without having to pay and you can also earn money while you're attending collage. students will be able to graduate early from collage and with a really high degree that could benefit them by finding job where they start at the top like others professionals people.

Students will struggle a lot looking for collages that are not too expensive or collages that can help them save money. For example nova is an academic instutude collage that has a lot of benifits for students such as saving money for collage. Have apportunities of going to others university or instutudes where you can work as an asisting and get well paid. Nova can be very helpful institutude that students can attened to because they only attened to nova for two years. At nova they prepare students to when they are ready to move on to a four year collage but you need to have a good GPA and have all the requirements that nova asks for.

However not everyone agrees that atteneding to school is benificial for students. some students think that having to show up to school is a waste of time and that it would be better if they learn by looking tutorials on youtube or being able to attend classes from home. For example if students don't attened to school they won't be able to understand anything which it will cause them to stress out and make them give up on there dreams. students won't adchieve if we let them attend classes from home. Students also don't agree about having good grades and a good GPA. For example students think that they can still go to the collages they want to attened without matter of there grades and GPA that all they had to do is pay. but the question is ""do you have the money to pay collage?"".

You want to know why? it was because I was always keeping myself busy with work. We accomplish more if we are always doing something because you get more work done, you can be more successful, and you can be more healthy.

First, you get more work done, for example I had a science project due in one month and I decided to get working on it until I had finished it, consequently I had more time to work on my other school work. My friend, Generic_Name she is always working at McDonalds and she never takes any days off. She refuses to stay home and be lazy, therefore you will always see her working on something productive. It could be school work, her job, or anything else that benefits her. Generic_Name had a book project to do and since she was always working she accomplished more than her friend, Generic_Name.

Secondly, you can be more successful, for example my cousin, Generic_Name was always exploring with cars until he found out he wanted mechanic to be his major. Since he knows a lot about cars he can always help people when their cars break down and can also make money that way. Generic_Name can later on open his own mechanic shop in the future. My friend, Generic_Name has also been very successful. She absolutely loves doing makeup on her and on other people. Generic_Name's makeup looks are so amazing she has become a famous makeup artist. I also became successful when I opened up my baleada shop. Every one loved the taste of my homemade tortillas filled with beans, eggs, avocado, and cheese.

Finally, you can be more healthy, for example I go out to run each morning instead of sleeping in. Running outside in the morning can be very healthy because you are stretching your muscles to start the day. Although some people may think inactivity serves a purpose, they are incorrect because inactivity can be unhealthy. My friend, Generic_Name got in shape because he goes to Golds Gym every day after work. He rather go to the gym on his free days instead of staying home watching Naruto because that will not benefit him.

You can get more work done, you can be more successful, and you can be more healthy when you accomplish more if you are always doing something.

I also strongly believe that students should have freedom to choose which elective him or her want's to take. A student that has the freedom to choose his or hers electives, he or she views the classes as more divers fun and interactive, then required art classes.

First of all most people believes that all students are required to take art class, music, and drama class. Most of all others think that students will actually cooperate to there fullest, and pass the class with higher letter grads. Like in an unrequited class most students will not actually take the art classes seriously, and fail with low letter grades. In comparison students with a required class will most likely take the class seriously knowing if they dont tighten up, and do what is asked the'll get low grades on multiple assignments like projects, class projects, and event tests. An nonparticipating students score will drop significantly. Which in fact they are wrong student shouldnt have to take the art classes to begin with.

In my true opinion student should have the chance to express his or her true feelings, and reach a main goal in life. People arent going to tell use students what career paths to fallow we simply choose our own paths. Really in fact art classes should be an elective instead of it having to be required. Art classes are fun I my self take art by choose and enjoy ever single part of it. Again arts should not be a requirement for students it is unethical, and unheard of as far as i know.

Music, drama, and art class are three amazing electives, and forever will be electives. what sense is it to make an art class a requirement to pass? No sense in my opinion art allows us students to express out inner happiness, deepest emotions, and embrace them. However, at the end of the day art classes should be and always stay an elective. What use will it be to us students in the real world? No use at all, unless a student wants to fallow a career path in art.

All the more reasons why I know art classes such as drama, acting, and music classes should not be a requirement for students. Electives are much more divers, fun, and interactive. Also students should have the freedom to choose his or her electives. There is no sense in making an art class a requiermnet for use students. Most students are not fallowing a type of caree in art, and will not be of much use to us in the future. ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,2.5

The technology in the world is change all time or each year, sometime people use the phone with excessive time; practically we live on red social. The cellphone it's the first device that the humans use more time in the world.

How we can see at the pass to the years the technology advance to fast around to the world, and thanks to the technology we forget how is the content in a book; in my personal opinion is happens.

I think that the technology was some revolutionary for the humanity because the technology come to make the life more easy to the humans in the world. We are blinds because we prefer pass more time in the phone than pass more time with our family, we dedicate our time in red social, where only we are lose the time.

Did you ever try to create a new substance from chemicals? Will this is how people in the lab can do it. First, they measure the liquid and check the temperature. Then, they add another substance to react with the liquid and measure it again and check the temperature. Lastly, the liquid will precipitate or create a gas form. To conclude, this is how people create a new substance and chemicals in the lab.

You can't do a experiment without learning more about chemicals and their reactions. People who want to study about science take science class or a course to learn more about substance and chemicals. Also, people in the lab learn about chemical compounds and their specific names. To conclude, this is how people studying or learning about chemicals and substances.

911DD337DD61,"In my opinion, students should take electives instead of music, drama, or arts. Some students may dislike to be in music or drama because they don't have experience to be singing or drawing. They should focus on what they are good at for themselves.

One reason that students should take electives, they will pay attention to their classes and finish up their work to get the credit. Some students can't multi-task if they do drama class and math at the same time. They would have to focus on the important things that they're good at. Students shouldn't be wasting time on taking drama or music classes because they may not be interested in doing those classes. It'll be easier for the students to learn more with their assignments, instead of worrying about arts or dram classes.

For example, during in my junior year, the school wanted me to take art and music. I never wanted to take art because I knew I would be awful at drawing and fail the class. I had to take music also, I was horrible playing the guitar and I was failing in that class. I've told the teacher that I couldnt take art nor music because I wasn't great at it. I just wanted to focus on my course classes, so that I can graduate and get pass all my classes to graduate my year.

Second reason that students shouldnt take it, they will finish with their course classes and will get to graduate their year. It's hard when some students can't do what others can do at drama or musics. It'll be the best opportunity for the students to focus and work hard on their course classes. They should not worry about the electives because that can be done at the end of the year. They won't have to stress about their grades to be below F if they don't take the electives. They wouldn't stress about taking electives and course classes at the same time because it'll stress them out.

Last reason, students shouldn't take advantage of making themselves work more as they are now. They should only worry about their course classes because those are the only classes that will make them graduate. Some students have no talent or experienced to do art or to be in musics classes. It's better for them to finish their course classes and then at the end, they can take their electives.

Therefore, these are the reasons why students shouldn't be required to take classes in arts, musics, or drama.                                                                                                                                 ",3.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0

I would love to be studying from my house because I would never have any distractions, and I can just stay comfortable the whole time. People say online school is better than online school, but online school is more comfortable and nicer for students because they don't have to get dressed and ready just for school, they can take their time with the school work, and they have more time to do more stuff like get a job or play a sport.

A lot of students get stressed in the morning because they don't know what to wear for school. What if they didn't have to worry about that anymore? I don't like to get up just to dress and get ready for school. Online school, the type of school that students don't have to worry about what you wear or how people think of you because no one will ever see you. We all get lazy at some point in life, and we just want somethinh that will make us feel comfortable while studying.

All students get rushed because they have too much work to do, and sometimes, they don't do it on time because it's too stressful for them to finish it all. Online school gives you a long time to finish all your work and maybe a little extra time to relax. My friends and I are always stressed because of how much school work we have to do, but if we could do online school, it would all be so easy and less stressful. Online school is the best way to get time for all your work.

Everyone that goes to a school knows how hard it is to keep up with the work and what they do outside of school. Maybe it's a sport or a job or it could be both. It would be great if we all had that extra time to do all that without stressing. I rarely have time for school and work , but my friend, Generic_Name, does online school, and she has all time she needs to finish her school work, go to her job, and play lacrosse.

Some might say that going to a normal school is the best way to study; however, online school is a better and safer for students because they are able to take their time with the school work. they don't need to get up and stress themselves about what they should wear or how they look, and they have more time for other stuffthat aren't related to school like sports or jobs. How nice would it be if we didn't have to worry about any of these problems? Online school will have you relaxed most of the time.             ",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5

He is always happy and smiling he shows wisdom and makes other around him happy. My other person the shares wisdom and experience is my grandma.

She has share a lot of her experience of cooking I learn something new from her cooking ability she is a bit old but it does't stop her she has a lot of energy to make food for her family I learn from by seeing her cook an egg or make chicken I see her, and learn from her experience.

When we go to the beach my grandma always takes food so she wakes up early and starts cooking.

From the experience from my grandma I learn how to use spices and cuts of meats in a dish,

Also learn the amount of vegetables or spices that some dishes have my grandma been cooking for almost all her life she knows what taste good and what taste bad.

She teaches me how to cook some basic but delicious plates.

I think Learning from the experience of others is better because they been alive longer and know a lot about the topic like cooking, playing a sport, Driving, swimming or teaching they study or practice a lot that they became masters at it. They also been a live longer and knows how it works. Like my grandma she is good at cooking so I press attention to her cooking and see what new things I learn. An Example is when you are a teenager you want to buy the best of the best pair of shoes to show your friends that you got something that they done But if your parents say to not buy them and to save the money instead to buy something better and more special later in life like a car there is were we should press attention to what they say about spending money because they are older there brain is fully developed and they know what to save for because they are older and have been here longer and know how to use money.

Thats why I listed to what the older grandpas and grandmas have to say when I do something Bad or incorrect because they pass that and know how it was and they want us to Be susses full in our on life and they share with us wisdom and experience and thats Important because they we can learn from them.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5

But for this idea people have different opinion. Someone say school should not follow this model by extending the school day two hours because only four-day school students can not learned enough knowledge. But in my opinion I think school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours because this pattern is very good for economize resources and four-day school may promote students efficient study.

Some parents think four-day school is too sort for them children can not learned enough knowledge. And three-day weekend is too long. them children may do not study. So parents worry about the foreground for them children.

In my opinion I think school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours because this pattern is very good for economize resources. We can do a easy math for this question. How many electric for one lamp? How many lamp in one school? How many school in US? You can image it is a big resources spend just for electric. That is why I am agreed the four-day school.

The four-day school have benefit to student also. Because students need learn five-day knowledge in four-day. It may promote students efficient study. The efficient study is useful for the study and work at future.

946D8B23ECA6,"I agree with Albert Einstein when he said that imagination is more important than knowledge. within you knowledge comes you imagination. in that imagination you see that it will help you receive your knowledge from somewhere that you did imagined. even tho sometime you imagination can mess your Brain a little when you go ahead of yourself. Like when you think about a subject that takes you way over that your brain wont handle itself.

but mabey sometimes your knowledge can be more efficient than your imagination because your brain is acting more mature when it comes to obstacles that are difficult. your brain acts more when its come to a problem like that time you got stuck on that question on that math test you've taken. sometime even when you are reading a book. reading a book may help you vocabulary when you read.

but there're time when they both help each other. both knowledge and imagination can help when you construct something. mabey you wanted to built something but you had no idea what. thats why you have you imagination comes right on in to tell you many ideas on what to build. once you think of the build you knowledge is there to help out to figure out on how you should build it. your brain get all the knowledge to help to build that dimension of the building there s how both can work together,

but still there're some negative times when it come to imagination and knowledge. like that time you are felling a bit down and your imagination said that you cant find anything to make you happy. sometime when your imagination goes a bit to far like that time you play with friends when you were younger you can make thing a bit unfair with your imagination and can loose that friend. in middle school with that knowledge of yours can change many things on a test. you can do good or bad. but say you did good and you were the student that had the highest score but you friend go one of the lowest score but you bragged about it yo can also loose that friend.

imagen if a 16 year old boy wanted a job. he may have not be the smartest but he has a few bad grades. either he will get a get a good job or he'll stay jobless cause if how much knowledge he had since he does no study hard enough. so other students may have better knowledge and have received the job they have wanted. mabey t he 16 year old boy needed the job to pay for food but he had to ask all his friend to buy food since he had no ob nor the money. so in the future he became homeless because he had to pay the money back to the friends he had cause he needed money.

young children have the most imagination since they have nothing to expect. but at night children think they see monster are on closets and want to have their mom and dad to come see it for themselves but their parents say that there are no monsters. later the night they start hearing noises but cant tell were its coming from so they scream mom dad again because the child thought there was still a monster in the room. but the parents still say that there are still no monster in the room. later on the child starts to think that there it still a monster so the child went on outside the room and notice that it was no monster it was just their parent just making noise just to scare their child just for fun.",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5

I want to go to a university, but to achieve this goal, I have to put forth effort my going to school and studying all the time. I am always doing something while I am in school, and I am not allowed to be on my cell phone. This will not help me pass in school, even after school I sometimes stay in tutoring for Math and English, because I have trouble. This will be true in school, sports, and in life like my mother tells me all the time. I have to agree that always staying busy will allow you to accomplish more in life.

In my school, soccer also helps me stay busy, because I am on the team. We have to practice everyday to have a chance to win. I want to be the best player that I can be, and to do this I have to always practice. My coach tells me the more I practice, and the busier that I am the better condition I will be in for the game. Soccer takes a lot of energy and you are always active in the game and you need to be more active than the other team to win. Always doing something in sports allows you to be better.

My mom told me when she was growing up that she was poor, and she did not always have food to eat so she picked mangoes off of the tree. She did go to school, but when she was not in school she had to always stay busy. She would go to her grandmother's house to wash clothes or sell some of the mangoes that she picked in the street. She was fifteen years old, and she had no shoes so she worked for rich people in their house cleaning. She tells me this so that I will understand that I have to stay active and she has worked hard to give me a better life.

951DBA563386,"Do you make your own decisions or do you seek guidance from experts ? I believe that people should be able make their own decisions. I believe this because people are not away right about things and what they say. Another reason would be because only yourself know what chooses you want to make in life and so those are your decisions. My third reasons why I would say that people should be able to make their own decisions is because you shouldnt follow what others do. You always see people making good or bad chooses or making not good decisions but does that mean you got to do what others do, no because you have to make those chooses on your own.

My decision for people to make their own decisions would be because trusting others on what they say isnt always the right things. Would you want your best friend making a decisions for you ? Maybe not because you never know if she/he could be right or telling a lie. People in life are not always right about things ,you dont want to get in trouble for doing something dumb or that isn't the right thing for you to do . If you make a good decision on something at school or basically anywhere you can show others on how to make good chooses so they wouldn't make mistakes . This why you shouldn't listen to people making decisions for you this is because they can cause problem and get you in a situation where you dont want to be put in.

In life theirs so many things you can do but it all up to you . You decide what you want to do, you shouldn't let other people judge you in your decisions because they shouldnt get in involved . This is because everyone does what they want to do in life . If you make a bad decision thats all on you because you made the decision not someone else you can't blame others for that when it comes to you getting involved in a situation that you got yourself put in. I know your children in school might've gotten in trouble with something and if not it because they are great children who don't follow what others do. There are ton of students in school who make bad decisions and this because they like to do what others do by following what others do and seeing others do bad chooses. In that case that is not right because it makes them get in trouble and they lose time of education for making bad decision.

When it comes to making your decisions you make your chooses. Only you know what chooses you want to make. If you do don't want to do something you should't do it . Don't be afraid to not do something because you think it a bad decisions just first before everything think about what your doing. You should always question yourself is it a good choose or not because your the one making your own chooses. Everyone is their self you shouldn't be controlled by anyone. When it came to me making new friends at school I choose wisely with who I would want to be friends with because I didn't want me to be influenced by making bad chooses by others. No one has the right to choose to do things for others when it comes to making chooses it all depends on yourself.

In conclusion just always remember that you should always pick your decisions and not others for you. I know in the world we live in we all know that not everyone makes good chooses which is okay in some cases. This just means that not everyone is perfect which is true because their is at least one thing in life that you made a bad decision on. People just need time to think about what chooses or decisions they want to make so that after they make the chooses or decisions they don't think about it twice and why they should've made a wisely decision.

When someone know you or see you for the first time, the way you act, speak or the way you look is what they use to create an idea of how you really are. And when people already have an idea of how you are it is very hard to make them think different. Sometimes when you tell them you are a different person, they won't give you a chance to demostrate if is true, and they will just keep the idea they already have. People who knew you time ago and did not see you again they will keep the idea that they have about you, even if you already change.

Sometimes you meet people in the wrong moment, and they get a bad impression about you. Then they just keep their distance or go away and you can not do anything to change their opinion. First impressions are very hard to change because the majority of people judge you on the first thing they notice about you, it can be your appearence or the way you act.

Although I think first impression are almost impossible to change there are people who thinks that it is not hard to change first impressions , and they may be not wrong also, because there are people who give you an opportunity to start over and show them that you are different; However even if there are some ways you can change the impression that someone has about you, there are more reasons why it is almost impossible to change first impressions.

When students enter at high school are likely to get interest in anything and I believe their great skills they can show at high school, the support from their parents and think about their own future, is a good idea for students commit to a specific career at young age.

The great skills that a student can show in any course say a lot. There are many students that have differents roles inside the high school. Some of the roles they play are in different environments. There are students that really like Fine Arts, Music Band, Chorus, Act, etc. However, students usually get interest to show skills in differents areas to be a professional like Masters, Lawyers, Bachelors, Doctors, etc. Actually, these careers are more convenient to students but also they need support.

The most students gain total support by their parents and is a big priviledge. Nowdays, there are students that leave the school because they do not have enough support from their parents and this is a awful situation into the society.

Students should be supported to do their job as students and not be concerned about any other stuff beside school. Parents have not to be just the supporters. All the school staff can also support students. The support is very import into society because students are future of the entire wolrd and I know we can make a change at worlwild.

Think in a great and awesome future for us and new generation is amazing. For youngers students is easy to figure out what is necessary and what not. That's why the world needs brilliant minds and leave a legacy that can make bigger differences. More culture, respect to the Rights, more opportunities of jobs, more health to everyone, feed to everyone, and a health and wealthy world are some needs students and people wish to live in good environment to everyone.

In conclusion, students are guided and helped to think in a specific carrer by influnces like cources and lifetime in and out of the high school. The skills that a student can shows is simply awesome, they have great imagination. The support for students is in our hands, students have to be supported. The most important area is focus in their future as the best, doing big differences and doing a legacy. To be young is awesome.",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5

my reason for why i agree with the school boards planning to add one hour and a half is because if we are doing a worksheet or any notes and we dont finish the notes because of how less of a time we have in the class and with that that extra hour we can get some more time to finish work we need to finish.

Another reason why i think that would be a really good idea is because it would not only give us more time to finish and do work but it would also be very helpful to the teachers. because it would give them more time to teach us and finish things they need to do. and Teachers won't have to worry about not finishing their lesson because of how much time they have in that class.

I also believe that if we do extend the school day longer we would learn more because of the extra time we are getting. and it would give us more time to learn. if we dont know how to do that subject the Teacher would have more time to go over it again and tell us step by step how to do it and help us to improve and get better at it.

Another good reason is because that extra hour can help us get better at the subject you dont like or can help you get better grades because the Teachers can show you how to do it and you won't struggle in test because the

Teacher reviewed it with you and it would benefit you because you would start getting better at it.

The extended hour can benefit the teachers a lot because it would give them more time for planning and doing stuff they need to do and what that extra hour we can make up all the work that we didn't finish.

The problem's if we do not get the extra hour is Teachers wont have time to get through their lesson because they wont have much time. and student's wont be able to get help on what they need help on. another reason is that students will fall behind because they won't have much time to get through the subject they need to finish and they will have to finish the next day while other people will be finished with that subject.

These are my reasons why i would agree on the school extending the school day one hour and a half longer because it would benefit the students and the Teachers.        ",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5

But many famous people has shared their own stories of life and it show how working alone can open your brain to another level and acomplish more of what others think that just can be done in group. I read an old story of my favorite wrestler , and he explained how he worked really hard at the gym to become one of the best wrestler man in the whole story;that's why I think is better to work alone because working alone help to increase your understanding , it show that you are willing to grow on your own, and it will be one more step forward of your knowledgy.

Consider,for a moment, working alone will help to increase your understanding and if working alone have so many people on the top of hall of fame why we should not try to be one of those people , but to be one of those people we need to work harder than ever. However, people must work alone and they must feel the pain of the hard work that they need to get done. Furthermore,to increase your understanding you must try to learn or do something new every single day of your life, In order to see the result of the hard work that you are doing , does not matter if that is a meantal or physical work as long as you are doing a safe work to succed in those goals.

Besides, working by yourself is safer than working in group and when people work alone it show the desires to grow by their own experiences because a lot of times we trust people that we should not trust for many reason as envious of what you are cusseding at, pervert people in your group doing the wrong work that they should not do,and many times they do the wrong work just to see you down or because they are not interesting on the topic or kind of work than the group supposed to be doing. According with paragraph one ,working alone will definitely take you to succed in your goals and you will get each of your goals done. However, you must be focus and give all the motivation to those dreams that you have in life.

There is a lot of people that think is better to be working in group than by ourselves because five heads think better than a single one. True , I agrees that five heads think better than one , but how about not every menber in the group is agree with the topic or the material that they are working on; what could happen there is problems between themselves because none of them have the same goals or thoughts. Moreover, it could even cause discussiones with teachers, and it will be worse for the group, so which means working alone would be the best option for everyone to take. That way every person can work on their goals and express their diffrent thoughts without getting into discussions.

Sometimes student do not sleep as well, or they do not have much energy to play, because they do not eat before start the game. Everybody needs to know before they have a game we need to eat healthy, and drink enough water. Sometimes famous death for that kind of reason, so we need to learn about the experience. Life is very important for everybody, so we need to look what's the first thing we can do before they think and act too.

Family is more important than the game, so they do not have time to practice. Sometimes family want to explore places for example; New York, Florida, and Boston that state has beautiful place to swim play, and we can do everything. That's why student do not have time to practice the game. Game is an important thing they can learn too much, and maybe in the future they can get a award like a professional or famous on games.

Some students do not have time to practice, because they need to work to pay the bills for example; pay the insurance for the car, pay the rent where they live, and also pay the bill for the cellphone. That's is the reason we do not have time to practice. That's why we failure the game, because we work at night and then we are going to school all day. When it is time to practice the game we do not have energy to play, so that is the cause we lost the game every time. We needed to work a part-time on that way we got more time to practice the game, so the next time we can win the game. Sometimes the family do not help them, because they said we need to learn how they make a money to obtain the food for each person.

Eating healthy is good for everyone, so we need to eat every day. Also we can eat fruit every time, because that has to much protein. That's is the first thing we can do before beat the team, because that make they strong. they need to go the gym too, because that help you to get a healthy body. Sometimes the first thing we can do is eating, and then go to sleep this is not a good choice for them.

Please help all the students who is trying to work and continuing to go to school, because they are the future on the world. We need to help them because sometimes we have a dream, but no body try to help that's why students can't realized they dreams.

Some others people realized right before they are committing the mistake and they are just avoiding them. Although some say, successing in life without failures, our lifes wouldn't make sense, because we would not learn how to be success in our life's. Actually, successing in life with failures is more baneficial to our life's, because we learn how to believes on us, and we may have a life without doubts.

As a result, if we are the kind of person who doesn't makes any mistakes and realizing to success. i think that we wouldn't know what are we doing wrong to be determinated person. Also most of the people wouldn't have knowlwdge to succes in their lifes. Actually, when people cling to themselves isn't good for their goals in lifes.

However, I believe that making failures is how we move on to succe ss in life and is more beneficial to our life's. Otherwise i can tell the 80% of the people belives that making failures is how we learn to success and we become a civilized person. Sometimes most of the people have goals to achieve in their life's. As a matter of fact,

when we are setting goals to our life's and we can't get that goal it's because we are doing something wrong and we don't even realize what's wrong with it. its when we are learning to be focus and making sure next time to be success and whatever we did wrong.

In fact, sometimes it's hard to when we have had failures a fewers times, because we do not want to commit mistakes, but i think that is a beneficial for most of the people. Because the most mistakes we have and at the same time we overcome to have more experience in life. First of all, when we fix what we did wrong. Also I believe that fixing problems is a good way to be success in life. second of all, my suggestions are that to be a positive person, and determinate, smart, and wise person it make us a better person in success.

In conclusion, some people believes that having failures is how we are success in life and others don't think that way. However i do believe so that to be a success person, we have to fail a fewers times, because it's really important to me to be a determinate person.

9947BA6C3149,"The option of distance learning can be helpful for students in many ways. Internet have the access of having to take classes online or communicating with a teacher. Students can get the same knowledge in school or in their house but easier. Bullying is the major problem in school;however, teachers can avoid bully by having the option of distance learning. Teenagers might be bad influence for other teenagers by forcing students to drink,smoke, or even worse to use drugs. The majority of students have responsibilities to take care of after school, taking other classes online,taking care of their siblings, or have a job.

Even though teachers try to avoid bully, is hard to make sure students are well behave some do not listen at all and not care or some are lazy. Some student's lives are tough for many reasons it can be by their parents that do not pay attention to them, stress by having too much school work, or some of them have already a job, and adding one more by bully, it can bring bad consequences. In many cases students suicide because of the stress, or they are tired of people not paying attention to them, and not care about what happens in their life. They are cases that teachers are aware of bully, but they ignore the fact that the school is not a save place to be anymore and that they are big problems going on at the school and having to deal with it is better than having to call their parents and do something about it. Teenagers do not realized the fact that they can be responsible for someones death and they be can put in jail by many years, and ruin their live by making fun of someone,or punching other students, it can be something silly and that little things can ruin their lives.

Some students might be a bad influence for other students by forcing them to do several things that can bring consequences for the rest of their lives by being in jail,being unhealthy,or change their life in a bad way. In this days is normal or cool for a student to drink, smoke, use drugs and forcing other students to do the same. The ""if you do not do this I am not your friend no more"", or "" you do not love me if you do not this"" or even worse ""if you do not drink with me I am going to tell everyone your secrets"" that makes students be afraid of losing their friend, girlfriend/boyfriend forcing them to make actions that do not beneficial them at any pint of their lives. Teachers in high school are though to students; however, some students do not care about their education at all and they go to school to talk to a friend or distract other students effecting other students education. Some students are always energetic, getting in trouble all the time,distracting other students, being a bad influence, instead of giving them referrals or suspending them it can be recommend to do home school to avoid any type of problems.

It is a good idea to start saving money for college/future and having a job. It is difficult to study or do homework while having a job students get stress and frustrated to have to attended to school and a job. School waste time in lunch or having other activity when students can do all their work in home and a few hours they are done and can take care of other responsibilities. In students houses can take their time and not have to rush in a assignment or in a test, having the opportunity to not get stress over school work. Having to wake up at the morning it is a hard thing to do for the majority of students, not having a good rest at night can effect students by ,grades, not concentrating, falling asleep at class, not paying attention,always been tired,or skipping some classes can effect when they graduate.

In conclusion having the opportunity to do home school can make a big difference in a good way to the school and to the students education. That it is something that can be a easy way to learn and have the same knowledge like the other students, but in easier way. Internet have the access to many apps to help students can be a fun way to learn instead be sitting in a classroom for two hours. Students can avoid the fact that are some students that do not care at all and if they do not care about their live they are more possible not care about other student education.

99CAD0AF3560,"Is playing a sport a fun activity for students? Does it help students exercise? Does it help students get healthier? I agree that playing a sport is a fun activity to all students for many reasons.

To begin with, playing a sport is a good way to be more energetic. Playing a sport can help students exercise. Students might do some warm up games, do some work outs or they can practice at home with their families. Playing a sport can also help students get healthier. Students get more energetic, eat healthy food, and get in good shape. Playing a sport can help students do better things. They could run faster, get stronger, and it can help them do better in class

On the other hand, playing a sport is bad for some students. Students might get sick for being outside. If is winter and students are playing outside all day they might get sick from the cold or if is spring they might get sick from pollution. Some students might get injured. Students might break their arms or legs for playing with others students that are bigger than them. Some students might not be good at sports. Students might suck at soccer, football, or basketball and they won't play.

Even though playing a sport is bad for some students, they can still play. Even though students get sick they can still play. If some students get sick they can get medicine and go back to play. Even though some students might get injured they can recover. Some students might break their legs or arms, they can wait a few weeks and go back to play. Even though some students might not be good at sports they can still learn. Some students might suck at soccer, football. or basketball with practice they can learn how to play.

In conclusion, playing a sport is fun because you play with your friends, run around, or just feel the wind in your face. It helps students exercise by doing some warm up games, work outs, or practice at home with their families. It helps students get healthier by eating healthy food and get in good shape.

99ECAD55ABD3,"I think it's great for the older students to work with the younger student, because some young students haven't learned about what the older students learned, being a helper to younger ones especially in a school can be an amazing thing to do for example

They can help to teach them how to walk for the preschoolers

They can teach how to welcome people

It also helps them to have a great future

The Older students can also (maybe) earn some money for being an excellent helper to the younger students. It can also be a great hobbies for the older students to teach younger students how to live their normal lives and to greet others. Another reason why the older students to help the younger students is an excellent idea is how to be respectful and trustworthy to others. There can be a chance where the older students can teach younger students how to help others as well for example

Pick up someone else stuff if it fell on the floor

Help an old person cross the road

Teach kids how to write neatly

This kind of program could help the environment so much. The students can also travel around the world to help younger students in other countries for example

United Kingdom

Norway

Sweden

Denmark

Canada

And more! Having this type of need and help could this world so much. It helps across the country, around the world, all types of students can help others younger students how to live their lives, it can help go to collage and get a job that their very great at and in their job they can learn as well, it can make them get a talent from their job so they can learn how to do stuff in their jobs and become very good at. So yes I would recommend for the older students to help younger students (even around the world) how to live their normal lives. It can help so much for others and it teaches respect and that's why in every school they should have older students helping younger students and in other countries they should also have older students help younger students how to live normal lives and have a great future and they can also help their families and other families.

9A36D8AB4818,"Community parks provide a lot of fun ways to spend time outdoors. One of my three favorite ways to spend time outside would be playing sports, gardening and exercising. It's a productive way to spend your weekends.

First, Playing sports outdoors is very fun way to spend the day. You can play with your family and friends. You learn about communication and teamwork while playing sports. Communication is a life skill that is used everyday. You'll always talk to someone weather your saying good morning or good night speaking is always needed when talking to someone. Teamwork shows you how to value players on a team. Knowing your teammates worth and dreams is always a great way to start a lifetime friendship. Playing sports outdoors is a great way to spend your time.

Next, Gardening is a way to help out plants and to have fun. Gardening or watering plants gives the plants energy. Gardening may be done with family and friends. Your spending quality time with those around you. Buying seeds and planting them helps out the plant world by giving them new places to live. You may fix up the parks gardens to make it look nice. You don't lose anything from watering plants. Cutting grass or cleaning up around the neighbor hood is a good thing to do. Your doing a favor to your neighbors and nature. Gardening is a relaxing and fun way to spend your day outdoors.

Finally, Exercising isn't done by many people, people just want to spent time indoors and just watch television. Exercising is very important for humans to do. An average human is suppose to exercise three times a week. Going to the park and going for a run is a great way to exercise. Your loosing body fat and building up muscles. You may see animals and plants while your running. You can also exercise with your family and friends you don't have to exercise alone. Exercising is very relaxing and it's helps with blood pressure. You don't have to eat that healthy but its good to exercise at least three times a day.

In Conclusion, Spending time outdoors is very enjoyable. You can do these activities with the people around you. Three enjoyable ways you can spend time outdoors is by playing sports, gardening and exercising ",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.5
9A93D940C694,"Is it true that some students at some point in their life want vacation time? Yes, because not everyone is a retard that wants to be studying and going to school all the time. Almost every student wants rest from homework. I think having a summer break for students is a good idea because it gives students some time to relax their brain and body. It gives them time to spend some time with their family and enjoy thier every minute of life.

First of all, I think it's a good idea to have summer break because it gives students some time to relax their brain and body. It gives students some free time to do what they want to do like trying new things out, playing new sports and finding what their real talents are, instead of doing school work and other activites all the time. Doing meditation is really good for your brain and mind, and it's only done when you have time for it and nothing to distract you.

Secondly, I think it's a good idea to have summer break for students because it gives them time to spend some time with their family. Some of us are really bad at giving our parents time in life because it's just too much to do everyday. Half of student's day they spend in school and get no extra time for their parents. Spending time with parents is not wasting time when your really enoying it and it's a good time spend.

On the other hand, some people might argue that it's not a good idea for students to have summer break because they will waste their time by being home all day or texting their friends. It will kill their education time and won't give them enought time to get to where they want to be in future.

In conclution, I think it's a good idea for students to have summer break because it gives them the opportunity to go new places they never been to and try out new dishes they never tasted. I think life is too short to be doing homework and studying for tests, and planning for your future. Life is about having some fun time and enjoying every little moment with your family and friends instead of focused on one thing all day and everyday which is school.    ",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5
9AC838864995,"Im talking about if the school days should be extended by one and a half hours or not and the effects it'll have towards the students, teachers, and the whole school together.

So adding an hour and a half to a school can open a lot of opportunities to learn, more electives, and what most students would think of a longer day at school is bordem, but school is where you socialize the most during the day and as a kid school is where you meet most of your long time friends so there is more then just being bored at school it's a place you can socialize, have fun, and learn all in one day.

If it were up to me whether to leave the school schedule as it is or to add an hour and half to the school day I would have to disagree because if the teachers were to give piles of homework then when you get home you'd be exhausted and drained to the point where you arent able to then even if you did manage to then you would be so tired that it would effect the next day which would cause you to barely do any work in school so the students need to get out of school so they can get their homework done.

If students were to stay at school till 4pm assuming there bedtime is around 9pm then the would basically only have 5 hours to do their homework but wait so then imagine if they had chores to do around the house then once they've done their chores they'd be even more exhausted so after all that they had done what if they wanted to relax a little bit now they have such little time to do anything during their time off from school that they might have to stay up longer then they usually do now it's about 6am in the morning after last night they could barely get a goods night rest and their body and mind are completely drained for today and all they have is good breakfast to get their mind to at least keep them knowledgeable for the day and this whole cycle repeats over and over but then you can at least get a good weekend of relaxing so that you'll be refreshed for the weekdays.

I disagree with the decision to extend the school day because of the effects that it has towards students and how it can effect their mind and how much productivity they are able to produce could be affected due to overwhelming amount of work put upon a child. There are definitely many pros to having a good education and to be able to live a good life. Students may not want to go to school and can find it very overwhelming but at the same time the students are working very hard so they can have the best possible life they can. School is a place where you go to learn, have fun, and the school has provided the time so that students can learn what they want by having electives that they like the best because that what they might want to be when they grow up because if the school didn't have such excellent teachers the students could never succeed on their own and that's why the teachers have to relate to the student so they can have a much better understanding so that they can proceed to adulthood where their decisions can affect them badly.

9B5E878ED861,"Everyone would like to receive praise for their work, even if the work is not their best effort, that will make them not to think low of themselves and just give up. In my opinion, true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives an individual determination, and self confidence.

Although, some people believe that self-esteem comes from an achievement because it gives self-discipline; for instance, a student did a poor job on a classroom test , that means he is not receiving any praise and didn't achieve anything, but because of that he will be self-discipline, so he would do a good job next time and receive an achievement.

I think true self-esteem come from praise because it gives an individual determination. For example, if a student gets a non pleasant grade in class, and the teacher praises the student but also tell him to do better next time, that would give the student hope and determination to do better next time.

In addition, true self-esteem comes from self-confidence. For instance, I am in a soccer club, but every time we practice I don't do better because I don't have the confidence, but instead of the coach cutting me off the team, he came up to me and told me that I can do better. He praised me and courage me to do better. That is going me to build self-confident in me and I would start doing better during practice.

According to my reason and examples stated above, I think true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives a student determination and help build self-confidence in a student. To all the teachers, please praise a student work and let the student feel like the can do more and better.      ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5

Our principal told us that we should participate in at least one of our school activity. First I did not like it. Then I thought of one kid that went to my school and got a 1000 dollars just because he was good at his activity. So I agree with this decision because students can get to know each other, students can a college degree, and it helps them learn new things.

This activity can get students and new students to know each other. They can find there new best friend in there.

New students can get out of there shy sell and can make new friends there. Even old students can make new friends there too. Probably the whole class room can become friends !

Kids can get to know each other more better if there in a school activity.

If a student is good or great at there activity. They can also get a big college degree in it. Like Art or sports. there art work can go in a Art Show or in sports you can go in a big show ! Maybe you can get a college degree in any activity. Also can get money and a college degree.

Students can learn new things in there school activity. Students don't know yet what and what not there good at yet. So students need to try out for these activates so they can know. Student can explore too. They still have time to try out new things and to find out what there good at. They might be good at drawing and they just don't know it yet. Probably your good at drawing too. Theses school activities can help you and your future out.

9DDBBA28EBD0,"I agree with Michelangelo's words, because some time when we whant to do things we start a low level because we think we aren't not good enough to do it, even known that we can do it good. And you think others have more opportunitties to have success and you would not have any of them, and it only matter how fast you can learn and how good you do them.

One good example of it could be sports and I have had a time when something like that happened to me. These happened when I was at my last school Generic_School, I knew that the practices to try out for the teams were going to start in 2 days. And I thought about that I could make it to play with which ever one, but when one of my friends told me that a lot of students were going to try out. When he told me that I thought that wasen't good enough and that others could be a lot better than me, so I decided to not try out and I was already playing for one team of Generic_City and they told that if I whant it I could play for both and I answered no. I didn't accept to play with my school and next year I did the try outs just to see if at least I have a good level compared to others and the coach saw how I played and he put my on Varsity team. I played almost all games I got a record, and I archieve one goal that was to proved to me that I could play at a high level even knowing that a year before I was scare to try out.

Another reason Its that really frecuently that people got scared to try a challenge, and to show themself that they can do thing at a higher level than what they think. A similar expample is one of my cousins knew how to work in construction in El Salvador and he was really good at it, and when he just got here in US he knew that there was contruction sites and places that he could work on it. First he told me that we was excited and that he would get one of those joobs and somehow the next day he told me that he wasen't getting it any more. That was not inetersted any more and told that he didn't have enough skills and it was going to be to hard for him. I told him that yes It was going to be hard but he had a lots of skills and knowleage about it and it would take less time for him to learn what they do there. He said he was going to think about it and after a time he got the joob and it olny took him less than a month to know how they operated there and got hired more fast than others, because he was doing a good joob on everything that he has to do. He told me that he was happy to take that joob and first he was wrong when he said that he had not enought skills for that joob.

Also another reason of why I agree with Michelangelo is that I remenber that around 3 and the hallf years ago I played soccer just with friends afterschool and we played just for fun and to relax. I didin't whant it to play for a team because I felt that I was not to good to play for them. One day I was playing soccer afterschool with some friends, and one of my friends dad was a coach for a team of Generic_City and remenbered that he said to all of us that if we whant it to play for him in his team. All my friend got in the team and I was the only one that did not got in, because I felt that I wasen't good enought so i decided to not join the team. And for the next season he was loking for a goalkeeper and I accept it to got in because my friends convinced me to join. After I going and play my first games I sorprise my self and the team to cause I was playing a really good level and we won the league that season. For next season I got a record that was not receiving any goals in 10 games and that lead me to win the best goalkeeper in that season. And at the beggining of my third season our captain left ,and I got surprised that all all in the team wan't it me as a captain and my coach said that I was the captain of the teamI just got really happy.

And won the league and the All Starts tournament that year and since there I have played like 8 season because every year there are 2. I have won for my third year in a row the best goalkeeper in the league. First no one was interested on my and after some seasons almost all team in Generic_City teams whant it me and teams from Generic_City I had like 7 teams that whant it me to play with them.

In conclusion I strongly agree with Michelangelo's words, its really common that the worst danger for most of us is to set our aim too low and achieving less than what we can do, I have had some reason and example but in all of them I realise that if I work hard I can accomplish more than I think I deserve.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,2.5

I'll say the policy #1 because student its a good rule that student can only use there cell phone during the lunch and other free time so that the student can do something that make them fun during lunch time. its also good because student uses there phone to call there parent to pick them up or they forgot something on there house he or she can just call there parent to bring it to school.

Bring cell phone in school is important because cell phone is not just for texting its also for emergency for your parent if you need something or you have to go somewhere after school. you can also call and tell them that don't pick me up because I'm going to my friend house and i call you when you have to pick me up.

High school is a great place to know people that could help you in the future, and help you to reach your goals also high school is a great place to learn a lot of things and have fun at the same time.

In my opinion, 4 years of high school are better than 3 years because you have more time to study, you are able to have a break during summer, and keep your stress lower.

During this 4 years of school you are able to have enough time to study and prepare for a test, if you have a History test you have time to ask to your History teacher to help you, before or after school to make a review or practice, and get ready for the test. This is one reason why 4 years of school are better then 3 years of school, and you will be able to prepare for your next test also you can have some rest in summer.

In 4 years of school you will have a break during summer, and able to enjoy it with your family or friends doing some activities as going to some parks or museums, and any other different activities that you will like to do, and maybe go back to the school with more energy after summer. This reason also could help you to keep your stress lower when you are in high school.

When you are in high school you can stress a lot because you have to many homework and you need to study for a test, and if you take the 4 years of high you will have a lot of time to study do your homework and keep your stress lower, and during this 4 years you can practice some sports or any activity that you like in your school or outside the school and also this could help you to keep your stress lower. During this process of learning you could find people that are not agree with your opinion and they can say 3 years of school are better then 4 yours of school.

3 years of high school sounds great for some people they want to start working or maybe they think it could be easy but you will not able to enjoy your summer because you have a program to follow during summer, and sometimes you would need to stay after school for study, and you are not able to do the different activities that you like.

In my opinion 4 years of high school are better then 3 years of high school and in this 4 years of high school you will be able to graduate and you can enjoy the process of learning, and know a lot of people that could help you to graduate and reach your goals in the future.

9F68BAB4FB63,"Students graduated in three year of the High School!

I think is good idea because all student that want a best future try to do a good thing that it is a benefit for the school. when a student is smart make the time important for take other course for to have for credit is for that some student don't need to take the four grade in the high school, A student also that have excellent grade in all the classes, and only have a difficult classes, this student that had the opportunity for graduated early that other students.

Example:

A student of Generic_School is in 9 grade, but this student have a difficult classes, but this students is focus just in the classes, and have a excellent grade also this student take a deport after school all the days. The student he's prepared every time for the quiz, and for test.

Finish the school the student is the best student of the year in the school because He passed all the classes and the SOL. During the summer He go to the summer school for to pass other class that he going to have in 10 grade, finish the summer school He pass the class with excellent grade, so this student had a so much credit of the normal.

He stars the 10 grade, so He had other advanced classes, because in summer school he pass the classes that He was going to have in 10 grade. This student continue that, He pass all the classes, and SOL that He need for graduated. Now this students is in 11 grade, but the student had a big credit and He go to the school for 4 classes so this student have the opportunity for graduated in 11 grade because is a excellent student.

He finally is graduated the school in 11 grade, so He finish the school, but He said that want to go the collage because want to prepare more for to go to the university, because He want to be a excellent lawyer.

The excellent student finish the collage, and the university, so now He is a big lawyer with a great statutes. The parents of this excellent students, and good person, so they feeling fortunate for have a big son.

All we have the opportunity for to be a best person in the life, all depended how we wants to be in the life. Many student wants to have a excellent grade but don't put of they part for be a good students.

Now in day the most students just want to come to school for 3 or 4 classes but don't want study for had a good grade,many students go to school but don't go the classes, and other students is stay outside of school for smoky, because the most students used cigarette or other thing.

We don't know appreciated the best opportunity of the life.

Reasons for graduated in three year

All students who graduated early have a big opportunity in the collage, and the university, and the work or whatever place.

why?

because the old person thinking that this type of person are responsible in all the thing.

Are a people responsible!

Why?

because when have a big responsibility never said 'NO' and have care for all thing.

Example:

I'm Generic_Name, I work in Bank Of America, today my boss need to leave early because He had a compromised with other important person, and He give me the responsibility for received the money of today.

Be carefully!

Why?

because they try to make with carefully the work or whatever thing.

Example:

My name is Generic_Name, and I work a company of cake, and my supervisor said me congratulation because you are very carefully with the work all the time.

My Idea!

I think all the people we have the best opportunity in the life to be a best person in the live,but the major opportunity is that when we have somebody is protected, and supported our decisions.

When we start the education needed to keep the marge for be the person who we want to be. The thing are best when we support all bad thing.

The best idea is continue with the school and be a good students, because all student that it is educated, they type students have a more opportunity that other who they don't want to be a best person in the future.

Why the younger people just thinking in pass the life in party or in the street?

Why now in day we see a kids abandoned in the street?

Because many mother don't have a good education for to have a compromise of the had a kids, this type of mother just thinking in that the drugs,alcohol,or party is the major thing.

Many mother having a bad decisions!

So is for that what we need to prepare for to make more easy our life.

Have a diploma of the High School is very important because we work less, and we have a good job,when we have a good job we have a lot money, and when this happened we are prepare for take a funny moment in our life, But just for that is not the base for make whatever thing, first we need think what we need to do!

We know that this life is so hurt, and is more hurt when we take a bad decision like not finish the school or don't put care to our thing for to be prospered.

Some time is good help take course when the people don't finish the school.

Example:

take a course for by the license, and put a beauty salon.

take a course for by idea how to have a company of electricity.

take a course for be some body also a little important in the life.

take a course for be a teacher of music.

We have so much course for prepare more when we don't finish the school.

Some time when a students go to the school, and they not finish is responsibility of the parent guardian because the parent need to see for the son or daughter keep going the school, I think when the students don't finish the school part of this is fault of the parents.

How we can finished the school, and how can I do graduated?

The things for to finished the school is:

Go to the school every day.

Make the homework.

Prepared for the quiz or test.

Pass all the SOL.

Pass all the classes.

When you make all the work in the classes or in the school, and you pass all the thing, you can graduated. If you not want to go to the collage, the diploma of the High School is very important for have a good job in your life.          ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5
9FA1ED280D8E,"Do you think that the school hours should extend?

School is already not fun for many of the students, and by staying more in school students may have a bad mood or adituted, and it may lead to bad behavior and not make them get good grades! I disagree because it can be very tiring to stay school more longer, it can change your mood of being in school, and you may want to got out with friends or family.

The First reason, Is because if we stay more longer in school you are gonna get more tired. If you get tired in school you are not gonna have more energy to go outside and entertain yourself. And you would just go home and sleep all day long. However, if we don't extend the school hours, we won't be as tired, and we would have energy to go outside.

The Second reason, Is that if we stay longer in school it can change the way you are. Staying in school longer can change your mood because you won't be as happy. Because you would have to stay in school longer. Also you might have teachers you don't really like and you would have to see them longer. However, it doesn't have to be that way, if we don't extend the school hours.

The Final reason, Is that you woudn't have time to spend with your friends or family. Because most of that time you would be in school. ANd spending time with friends/family is the most important thing in life and school shouldn't take all the space froem your life.

In conclusion, I disagree that the school should add more school hours. because it is a waste of time, and it gets you more tired, it change youself, and it doesn't give more time to spend with friends/family.",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5
A02E1D0BEACF,"Hello, this is Generic_Name and i go to Generic_School. Today ill be taking position on an issue i have been hearing alot about .The issue is should students go to school or study online and take online classes. School provides more social life more teachers, and more classes that you have to go to everyday. When online classes are providing the classes you need to gradute but its online and for free unless you are trying to take extra classes to gradute earlier. It will be all your responsablity.

Students that go to school. They will have to wake up early around 6:30 - 7:00 to catch their bus to go to school because the bell will ring at 7:55. School also provides lunch and breakfast which i think are very good for you. they care about how your nutriton is or if the food is fresh or not. They have vegeteran food for those who are vegeteran and they got chicken and rice which i find pretty healthy. There will be social life going on during school because you will be meeting all these people from different places which i find very intresting to meet other people from different countries. You have to be very responsible on how to talk to people and how to act in public because it can get you in a serious trouble if you dont act straight. You will have 5 minutes to get to each class otherwise you are late!! be on time always. You are also getting so much help from the teachers you are not alone. If your teacher isnt there you have your friends in class they can help you figure out what you are stuck on school starts from 7:55 and it ends at 2:55. School will help you find your college there will bea class for you which is called career center that can assist you and help you find whats best for you and contact them if you decide.

Online or video conferencing (home school) is what people usually call it. If you are homeschooled you get to wake up whenever you want and you can go to bed whenever you want. You can start working along studying and balance your time and see what benifts you in the future. The choice is yours of what you want to eat. You will have more freedom, there will be noone there to bother you if you get bothered easily or like to work quite. I personally know alot of people that care about what others think of them and if they have friends or not or would people judge them because of what their wearing. If you are homeschooled you dont have to worry about that. The course will take you where you need to be its very straight forward , and they will quiz you very often to make sure your on the right path. You can decide when to study or what days that will depend on your schedual if you are working or not. There will be onone pressuring you to do homework or yelling at you if your late to school or class. Students consider taking online classes people judge alot nowdays and if you arent smart enough you will get your feelings hurt and that might cause depression for some people which can affect the student life.

My position on this issue. this issue is very common and i hear alot of students considering taking online classes .I think students should go to school and learn there because their will be all the help they need. They will take care of you not only that you also learn how to deal with people in real life and experience stories that can maybe one day make you laugh or maybe some stories that we all have learned lessons from. for example: lets say you get in a fight with someone and you and the other guy both got in trouble over something silly during your time in high school you will realize that its not worth it fighting people therefore you should take at least 10 seconds to think before you do anything that you might regret in the future. You will have teachers that can tutor you after and before class if you need to they will be on you because that will benift both of you guys. teachers would have very good history of good students and good grades teacher and students will have a good grade that can get them to college. If your taking online school you might fail to organize your time and the year might just go to waste. I say that becasue you will be with your family or working trying to save money for yourself but then you run out of time and your finding it very difficult at this point. i think its a very risky move to do because you will miss out alot of good days and a great atmosipher to be in with all these people around you and the teachers who try to help you success in your life and help you achieve all your goals by going to your dream college.

A0A2D6856B0E,"(1)A talent I have is pranking people. Something that inspired me to do pranks on people was a

YouTube creator. He went out in public and did these prank that inspired me to try them. My first prank I did was on my family by putting a woppie cushion on they seat it was fun and it made me laugh. I started to do more pranks on them but the pranks started to get boring they were no more good ideas.

My new ideas were using the pranks in new ways. Not what they were designed to do in new creative ways like putting a cockroach under a cookie that idea went really well it scared a lot of people that was one of my creative pranks.

my second one was. It was called Valentines through the hand box. This one took a little bit more effort then the rest of them because you had to cut a big hole through the box that was the size of your hand. How this work was on Valentines I would of gave someone a big box that is the shape of a heart and cover the bottom of the box were the hand would go in and they would open it and a hand would pop out at them. this is how I started to develop to use pranks to make people laugh. I still use these pranks I buy them off

Amazon and at 5 Below. Now I .use the prank more on teachers for the most part and how I use it is is in public I place a fake poop on the ground and people got disgusted and I once had a robot cockroach made people freak out. Well I think it is important to have some pranks in our life it make us feel joy and happy afterword because how the world is now a days, they is not that much joy in life more people then ever are sad so we all need sometimes a laugh in our lives no better way to do it by a harmless prank. pranking people is my talent those are some reason why I am good at pranking people and that how I use pranking in my life.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
A10E91E49973,"Yes, I do believe that imagination is important more than our knowledge. Albert Einstein is recognized as the most brilliant person who has ever lived. He used his imagination more than his knowledge, which made him accomplish so many things. He imagined things first, then used his knowledge to make that happen. If we couldn't imagine things, it would've been difficult for anyone to invent something or do a lot of things. All the inventors, who has invented things first used their imagination to create an image on their mind to see how it will look like, which helped them to make the item. Imagination helps us to accomplish our goal. It shows us what we can do to achieve it. Imagining helps us in many ways.

I always think or imagine before I do something big. I always imagine before making a choice or decision because I do not know how it will turn out. Sometimes some people think its funny and laughs that imagination can't come true but I do believe that no matter how hard is to accomplish my success, I will always try. My parents always tells me to imagine what I truly want to be when I grow, which is amazing. I think many parents are strict and tells their children to stop imagining things and always study, which I believe education is very important but telling someone to stop imagining is not quite right, Once I read in a article where it said that imagining thing is a natural habit and you will imagine things unless you have disability or blindness.

Once I also read a article that says that according to physcology imagining things is important for our brain . We imagine things everyday. When we are imagining things or just thinking, it helps to improve our brain. Scientist always has a prediction or imagines before doing an experience because they don't know what is going to happen. That helps them to be prepared so that if something happens their going to be ready for it. Albert Einstein had a an amazing knowledge also he believed that imagination is important, which made him be a successful person. There are so many celebrities, who wrote a quote about how imagining helped them achieve their goal. For example Taylor swift always imagined that shes going to be a singer when she was young and now she is a singer. Sometimes people can use imagination in a bad way like imagining to rob a bank but its not good, but they need to think deeply how it can affect them.

If you also don't use your knowledge can't succeed because you have to use imagination and knowledge to succeed, you have to use both. I will always remember this quote.",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5
A1DE235AFFC8,"What are we in the future. Who are we now from then. How did we get this way. The fact is a lot of people are born everyday. We can not stop who people are and become. Character traits start in ones teenage years. When you grow big you keep some and throw some. If it was your choice or some else who influence. There are a lot of people who change them selves. People who change for others . There is a lot of ways to become you.

When you know who you want to be as a person thats when you pick up traits. When you want to be something you start learning things. You can't have character if you don't want to be someone. Character traits are things people notice about you. Like right now there are to Women right now one is dressed nice has done her hair. She like to be fancy she blow her nose outside. She teaches Spanish I think so she travels for sure. She actually beautiful so you know she married. This another women is dressed causal and is wear a school jacket. She has a bun

But seems to be nice. She teaches science she most be smarts.

You thoughts of a lot of traits for them. How do you think they built them. They lived in different house and different schools and have a lot of different traits. Everyone can different trait and same one. You can never find someone with all the same traits. People see them in other and copy. People learn from them selves and make them. Traits are something you learn and keep.

Now if traits were something beyond your control thats different. If something beyond are control was doing this you'd think different. If you are talking about TV thats cool yeah I think so but not like that. TV is kinda like school but a lot of different things. You learn a lot of things from the TV that aren't the same. So you build off that. If you are talking like someone controlling of thats a whole different story. People would be more a like and thats how you tell we are in control.

People make their on character always. People will always be different from others . We all want to be are own person in the near future. Who wants to be someone else thats boring. We make new character and be are selves. We have control over who we are. You can live the same life as everyone and end up different. You control your own life.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0
A1EC959B8C13,"Would it be surprising to know if students to know that students learning at home helps them not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by the students getting to much school work that cannot be handed in one night. Students complain about having too much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Allowing any students to work on their own schedule help them become more motivated to work on their assignments. Students being educated at home gain more time to study and make up their own rules but responsible with it. Learning at home and not at school helps students to benefit themselves to get better grades.

One of the advantage of homeschooling is it can be done anywhere and at anytime. Because it can be done by a touch of a good night sleep, students rise up in morning fresh and have a flexible time schedule. The students can work around their parents schedule instead of the parent working around the student's schedule when it is time do some distance learning. Some students have trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pace set by teachers. The students cannot always work at the pace set by teachers. Distance learning allows students to work on their own pace and on their own schedule. Additionally, that there are no misguided rules about tardiness or how to dress. Because instead of worrying about the rules the students can focus on their studies. Distance learning can improve certain students learning process by having a more available schedule and by letting them learn in their own way.

When taking a test or notes at school there are many distractions that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. This is another reason that learning from home benefits students. Learning from home doesn't have the distractions that a classroom has. As a result of this, students won't lose focus on the work they are doing resulting in better grades. One of the reasons students get distracted in the first place is because they are in a class where other just fooling around which makes others who want to stay focus feel uncomfortable. If a student learns from home they will feel more relaxed and comfortable and won't stress about work. In school, you are stuck at a desk listening to the teacher's teachings for six hours and have a limited time to eat and take bathroom breaks. But there is other way around, if you are home, you can eat and do what you want when you want. Because of this, students will feel less pressured and get better grades then they would have if they were in school.

There are still a few reasons not to do distance learning. There many more opportunities with public and private schools. People from different colleges don't go to student's homes and try to advertise their career options. Making friends from home would be difficult without social interaction. Public and Private schools are great places to socialize during free time. If everyone goes home to attend school, funding for public schooling will fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of budget cuts. In public schools and private schools, depending on the teacher, cheating is hard to do. On the other hand, schooling at home, the students can easily look up the answers on the internet on a different device. So for all that matter it was you choose from not what want, it what you need.

Students should be offered classes online or at home because it is less distracting and less stressful. The flexibility of the time students are allowed to complete work would benefit the mental health and grades of the student. With a more flexible schedule, students would be more likely to succeed and make good grades. Even though socialization in the school environment allows students to make friends. The conclusion of the argument was that it is highly doubtful that the lack of interaction could affect the student in adulthood. Many students all over the world successfully take some, and even all classes from home. In the near future, school systems and all districts should provide distance learning.",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5
A2BA5F95C077,"Why high school school students should not take school programs that allow to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years .Students who take this program most take class after school , summer time or they not allow to take elective courses .Consequently students who take this program have less time to do homework, spend time with family or friends, enjoy the summer time or they not allow to take important elective classes like, foreign language, nutrition, music classes, computer skill class, or HPE.

Also students who take this program they could take classes for the same subject like, English nine and English teen at the same year. However students who take this program and they are going to college they could finish more early college and students who not going to college they can start working more early. But students who take this program are more exposed to fail or give up for the rush time that is in the programs and regular school years don`t have that problem.

A35B4B7CBD24,"There are some of the school districts offer programs that allow high schools students to graduate in three years. There are also some good students who always have good grades in all the classes. To graduate one year earlier, students must take extra online classes or elective courses. Otherwise, they will not get enough credit to graduate in three years instead doing it in traditional four years. It is a good idea to graduate one year earlier and enter college or the work force one year earlier because if students finish high school one year earlier, they can admit into a good colleges and fixed their career little faster for lifetime, they can help their family with economic problems, they can also make their own purchases.

Initially, this idea to finish high school one year earlier is the best idea for them who want to fixed their lifetime career earlier. Some of the student who come from the other countries just by themselves also graduate in three years, may be because their entire family lives in back home.

Suppose, they do not live good life in their back home. That's when students want to give them a better life by bringing them here. To bring them here, the students have to be able to have enough money and to feed them enough after bringing. And students can do all these works earlier if they finish high school in three years instead being in a high school for traditional four years.

Secondly, this idea is good for the students who's entire family already lives here, and there are some economic problem in the family. Student have permission to graduate high school earlier and enter work force earlier to help their family with economic problems. They graduate in three years and get a better full time job and help their family with economic problems. So, that way their family will not get stuck anywhere for the economic problems.

Finally, this idea to graduate one year earlier is good for them who want to finish high school earlier, to go to college and also to have a part time job on the other hand. So, they can make their own purchases, like phone, paying phone bill, going out to eat with friends, going on a trip with friends, etc.

Students can also have a full time job who do not want to go to college.

There is nothing wrong with graduating from high school in three years by working hard.

Some students do it to make their dream become true faster, some students do it for their family problems, some students do it for their own problems. However or whenever students graduate but parents want them all to graduate and make their future bright. After all, graduating from school is most important thing in every students life.

A3C5DE6588D0,"Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person. I think it's a positive effect on peoeple's lives. It can make there lives way more easier. Someone may not like going anywhere to check out books and shop so they prefer to order them online.

Technology helps a lot of people in their lives, an example can be someone that doesn't wants to attend public school so they prefer taking online classes. Online classes are helpful for students because they may have jobs to go to and they don't have time to attend so they can take online courses. Not just students but also teachers, instead of grading papers they can grade them online if they want to. Technology helps a lot of students with school and teachers with grading and other stuff.

Technology can help people lives in other ways, someone that doesn't like to go shopping can order them through online without speaking to anybody. Maybe they don't have time to go to the store and don't have transportation to get there. Technology can not just help you to order stuff but it can help you find an item that you don't know where it is without speaking to another person. There are many stores that you can check out by yourselves instead of waiting in line for another person that can ring you up. Technology helps a lot of people's lives in shopping.

So yes, I think technology has a positive effect on people's lives. It helps them in a lot of ways. Not just ordering stuff online but also physically. Someone that is it a wheelchair can get a chair with buttons on it for it can move on its own instead of pushing themselves. Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others.                ",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0
A47106D7B784,"My school should not follow the model by extending the school day two hours. A four day school week would be wonderful but, however, student would not like the fact that they have to stay in school for two extra hours. If my school extend the day for two hours; more students would skip class and not come to school. Some parents would be mad because they would spend less time at home with they children because of that. Generic_School should really cut school week to four days. I Think that its really unnecessary to extend the school day to two hours.

If My school decide to extent the school day by two hours, class would be longer and student's would get less sleep and come to school tired everyday. They can only extend the school day if we only go to school tree days a week. A four days a week school is still too much for kids to be going to. A bunch students barely wants to go to school for a whole week. Some student wouldn't have enough time to stay back in school for two extra hours ,because they work right after they get out of school.

Parents would be really mad if they had to wait two extra hours for they kids to get out of school. Most parent would rather they kids to stay in school for the whole week so they can get out on time. A four-day school school week would be good but staying in school for two extra hours is not worth it. Students would be in school for almost half a day if they stay back for the two hours. I rather be on my regular school schedule.

If Generic_School extend the school hours, kids would have more time to run the halls and skip they classes. By adding extra hours to our regular time , kids will have more time to get in trouble or get suspended. School shouldnt be no more than 7hours long. Every students should go to school on time so they can get out on time.

Extending the school hours is really unnecessary. Kids shouldnt stay in school for extra hours if they got to go to school for a whole week. School should just let out on regular time so the students could go home and get some rest. We should never have to stay in school for extra hours unless if its snowing outside. So its best that we stay on our regular school schedule and not add extra hours.           ",3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

They are people who don't have the life as you do. they wish and dream to have a better life to do what they want to do the things they wish to but you already have a live and everything you need in your life so dream big and make it come true. don't just sit idle and do nothing

Think about what you going to do. like some students say that they just want to be a famous ,if you want to a famous or important you better do something in your life, the other famous people did something they weren't idle in fact they spend their time just to tell us to do something in our life. like if you want to be a doctor you have to study for your dreams to be what ever you wanted to be. being a idle it's not going tho help you you life depends on you and your ideas. if you have dreams

Life needs energy to do something imagine you have a good ideas about doing a project in engineering and you designed really impressive, and the teacher like it and you entered the engineering science.

A5567EF4C8EA,"I believe that students should not have to commit to a career at a young age because they will not take the career serious they will take it as a joke. In addition they are young they do not know what is to have such a big responsibility. Students that are just to enter high school do not really know how hard they are going to have to work to be good in the career they would have selected.

First students do not really know what they have a passion for, they should not have to commit to a career they do not know if they are going to like after awhile in the career. Students should be able to really think about what they like and what interest them about a career before having just get in to it. A career is something you have to think before you get in to an specific career because later on you might want to change the career your in right now. At a young age kids do not really have a clue on what they really like or have an interest career wise. Kids that are young do not really think in careers they mostly think on being with there friends and going out to have fun. Also students should not have to be forced to be in a career they do not like thats why they should have time to think on what they like and what they do not like.

Next students are still young to know what career to get in to they should be forced to figure it out so quickly they should get more time to really think on it. In most situations kids change there minds and decide that the career they got in to does not favor them and they want to change the career. We do not really know what we really like until like the end of the year of high school I believe because at that time we are more matured. A career is something to take serious because in the future that would be where you will be working and if you do not like that will not be a pleasant job to work at. You be able to like the career you chose because if not you will not enjoy being in the career. Should enjoy the career you pick because it gives you passion and strength to keep getting up from bed and get ready to go to school to study that career.

Finally some students at a young age that are just about to enter high school do not pay enough attention to school or the career they are studying. In high school a lot of kids change and not for good they make bad decision and totally forget why they go to school for. They go to school to create a future for themselves to be able to have a better life not all kids think like that until something wrong happens. If they do not pay attention or take it serious they will not succeed in the career as well in life because they will not be able to get a good job. Some students in high school do not really think about it, but the reason why they go to school to better there lives in the future. If we did not have schools that give you the opportunity to study a career I wonder where would we be would we have good jobs that pays good enough money.

In conclusion, I do not think is a good Idea for students should commit to a career in at a young age. Kids that are still young do not really think about careers or what they can do with the career they study. It is a case of kids that take things seriously not all kids take everything serious and talking about school and careers that is a problem. That means that they do not want a better life or to better themselves they do not want the help.              ",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0
A5E9417DBC88,"Have you ever thought about how many people are ""success by going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm?."" This are are the words that British Minister Winston Churchill once said, and I am totally agree with him, to failure without loss of enthusiasm will creeate a person with experience and knowledge.

Once

I fail one time people think that I am a losser, but I see it in different way because I learned what

I did wrong in the first place, and I can fix the problem to make it perfect the second time. Moreover, every single mistake that I make give the opportunity to be success in life, so

I will never give up for any reason.

This remind a few years ago when I was in nine grade when my class took a test and I could not do it, so my teacher involve him self to make it try again as mush as I want it, so I decided to try the second time and still fail, for the first time in my life

I was going to give up, until my mom told me if you never fail and keep trying you are different than others. Hardly, but I decided to try again and this time the third time I new every single question and at the end I was the kid with the best score in class. if you ever thought about giving up with your first mistake you're wrong or because you fail one time you will never be successful, keep trying until you overcome every silgle obstacle.

Many people that are simbly of knowledge and success now were failure once. The important role that failure play in persouit of success. Failure show what kind of people I am and from where I coming, what makes me special and different from others.

On the other hand, people might say once you fail you will keep failing for the rest of your life or that I will never be successful person, but all what people say

I can use it to improve my self.

To resume, what the Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said "" success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.""? Its absultely true, if one day you want tio be succesful person you have to learn that there will be mistakes and fails no once,twices or maybe more times, but do not lossing enthusiasm will keep you in right way.

Getting to know who the person is by askin them about them self not just be like of there not good enough. For a example if someone is tired and your gunna be like oh their lazy you cant just base them from there firsr impresstions.

Is it impossible to change no its not impposble because it i ur mentality. In life nothing is inpossible you can easily chnage to a whole diffrent lets say, your a very mean person you can always change and be super nice to everyone. You can always change for who you are and for me i was very quiet i would never wanna go talk to poeple because i was really shy with people but now i like to talking to everyone else and i dont care who the person is i always introduce my self.

So i strongly agree with this statement you cannot jude someone by their first impressions some people thought i was really mean when they first met me bcause i would be tired end of the day and i wouldnt walk people because i was lazy and i didnt have that enery to talk. Thats why i changed my mentality so people would not call me lazy because its anoying so thats why i changed my whole life around i didnt wanna be so the same so i just changed, that made me super happy just for having a new life style.

When someone says it is impossible to change their wrong because they dont belive in them selfs that they can change has a new perosn i didnt think i was going to be a whole new diffrent person. and now i do really like who i am always smileing. Back then i would not like to smile i was a really boring person. I wont lie i have based poeple have their first impressions and be like dam there not cool people and end of the day they are cool people.

A72A4397F9F5,"Does the success consist of going through failure?

Yes, I am agree with this quote.

As we all know been successful is not easy. Some people say that hard things make hard soldiers; Therefore, failure is part of the success, but that does not make it easy for us; Why? Because no one likes the idea of suffer in order to be successful in life. As a matter of facts; Failure help us to become who we really want to be or who we are suppose to be, but no all of us get the chance to feel successful or not even see any progress; yet some people choose to give up, instead of fight for a better life; A life with success. But do we loss enthusiasm during our way to success? yes we do!

It is OK to loss enthusiasm in our way to success; that is showing every body else, and you as well that we are humans, and we can get tire sometimes; But what is not OK is to give up, because you will showing everybody that you are weak.

By showing us how difficult life can get, and tough us that you are the only one who choose to continue or to give up in your life; Oprah Winfred would be a great overcoming example. Oprah had suffer a lot since she was a child; yet she decided to continue with her life. Even though it was not easy to act like nothing happened, but she knew what king of person she wanted to be. Therefore, she decided to fight for those things she always wanted; instead of been crying all her life. Do not doubt that the sky is the limit even for the suffering. Oprah was a determinate woman; a woman who wanted to be successful. Yet everybody else was saying that she would not be able to accomplish what she wanted; instead of supporting her they were feeling sorry for her, and not doing anything. Therefore, she became more stronger than she had ever been, and now she is showing as that even after everything she has been through you can smile with placer and success.

On the other hand we have immigrants; those people who fight day by day to get no even what they want, but what they need. As an immigrant; success is the biggest word we all are working to accomplish, some people do not even believe they can accomplish more than what they have accomplished already; Even though everything we have accomplished until this day is because of failure; because each morning we decided to go out a fight to get something else than just failure. Eugenio Dervez is an example of overcoming in a different country, language, and culture. He is an inspire person for immigrant people in the USA. Eugenio has been proving us that dreams can come true. He showed us that everything is possible, you just need to believe in yourself, and trust that you are capable of so much more. Even though some people could be selfish even in your own family; Instead of been worry about others opinion worry about your future; so one day you can be successful, too.

Finally, in my experience I have fail so many times; but I am sure that any of those times I have fail will not stop me from what I want to do or who I want to be. Somehow my family does not have faith in me; and even though that if I fail I have no one to support me; I am afraid. However I know that I am capable of so much more, and I will fight until the end of this. Also, I always wanted to show everyone that they were wrong about me that I am capable as everyone else. Yet everybody was judging me, I decided to teach myself how do become a better version of me. I will continue fighting for myself. As you should do!

In conclusion, in order to success we have to go from failure to failure. As I was said before; there are so many people that have been showing us that everything is possible. Instead of been afraid for our mistakes we need to learn from them, so we can success in our life. Therefore, we have to think about the future that we want and start working on it, so we can be the people we want to be; the people our parents want us to be. By fighting this battles day by day we are not just creating a better country for ourselves, but a better country for our families. Remember that hard battles make hard soldiers.                                                                                                              ",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5

Being active has a grate purse in life. When people are active and awake, there aware of the surroundings. People wake up from the night sleep they had and having breakfast, getting ready for work, or heading out to the gym. But inactivity is a good too. In the of the day people sleep in the night or morning. Also many people need some rest to keep the same energy they had yesterday in the morning or night.

The best part when someone or yourself is active they can accomplish so many things. Having the good energy you can finish the work that is needed to be done at work or at home. Feeling about yourself of finishing your work or task is the bets feeling ever.

To have the same energy you just need some rest let the body relax to get the same energy, just like batter of your phone when charging.

Having a good night rest is good for the body, your body needs the energy to work and have a good system. When you don't have rest the body is slow, you're moody.

When you work alone it can get very boring and you may need help with something but also if you are working alone you can work at your own pace. With a group you may be pressure to finish something quicker but your teamates can help you with that. When someone is in a group they can act silly at times and give the teacher or the boss a headache but, when they focus they can get work done faster. Working with a group is not just for the work, it is for people to be social and so people can see how they act around other's. You can learn new things with other people that you did not already know or you can teach them something but at some point the whole group teaches everyone somehting new.

Working in a group you would probaly be pressured to stop being foolish and get your part done but if you have nice teamates then someone can help you with your part. Some people, perfer to work alone because they do not like to be pressured for no reason but in some ocasions those people are the one's to turn in late work or has incorrect information. In a group they correct you if you did not do something right and hellp you out if you ask for help and someone can help you becuase that's what a group is for to help each other learn new things. If a due date is coming up there can be so much pressure because maybe you have not even done your part or you are just lazy to do it some your teamates start to get mad at you and you do not know what to do.

Learning new things can be fun with a group because you might not be shy to ask questions so you learn new things and maybe someone else from your group learn that same thing as you. If the group learn's something new then they can use that thing in the future when they work alone or with a different group. Helping each other is one of the easiest way to get done with something but working alone you may take longer because you have to search up things and some times they do not know where to start.

Teachers put students in a group to see how they act around each other like if they act goofy or if they do not have self control. When working with a group there has to be self control because if the group is just being goofy then they would not get work done and they can get a bad grade and not work together in that class ever again. The teachers see how the students act and they see who should be with who and who should not be with someone. Working alone the teachers know that it will be quite and they would not know how the students act with friends around or a group.

Working together is way better then working alone because you become more social and not so much of a shy person. A group can also help you focus and have a good time all at once, also they can hep with having a good grade in that class because they helped you a lot. Students learn new things when they working with people and they might not be so shy.

A9544F0E8868,"First impressions always count no matter what and sometimes even impossible to change. Because,when meeting a new person or family member people judge on how people tend to act and speak. For example,if a women would like to apply for a new job and talked to the manager in a rudely manner her way of speaking and acting would affect her opportunity of working. So maybe think before what you're going to say because it affects your life. But,not only you but the others in the surrounding Therefore, being nice and kind to others helps the way people look and act when they show their first impressions to others.

First of all, first impressions not only are by judged by the person of a face but ,can sometimes leave a good mark or bad one because the way people look and the attitude they give. Sometimes that's why when people are going to give a first impression it has to be a clear and nice way so that the other gives back to people. Otherwise, when meeting with them later in the future they will regret to have spoken and talken to you because lack of behavior. So maybe think clearly andi treat others the way they do to others. Next time think of what positive things to share around and impressions to others.

Secondly, sometimes its impossible to change impressions and thats why we think before we speak. One way by noticing is when meeting a new person and by their first impression. Its says a lot by just looking at their behavior and attitude not only because the way they speak but interact with others. For example. when meeting a new employee at my job employees have to introduce themselves to each others so that they can create a long-lasting relationship. But, when meeting a new employee there was a guy and I introduced myself to him and he had just passed by without saying anything and was shocked when that happened.. Because, when meeting new people you have to introduce yourself to others like any other person in the world. Not only because their new but it helps people interact with each other.

Lastly, being able to give the first impression to others means a lot because it represents who you really are and the person you want to be. Therefore, people will comprehend the way you feel about others and how you treat them. So that your family and friends can be proud of who you are and realize who you've become as a person. Then, treat other with respect and kindness so that many others can spread positive things in life. maybe so later in life you can become someone and treat others the way you treat yourself. Then realize that first impressions always count as a good way to introduce yourself to others.

To summarize, the person who you are today is the person that can be later in life. Thats why first impressions always count no matter what and where you are and how you act as a person. Not only that but it also say a lot about people and you. Being kind and generous to others can affect the world by a lot not only by being kind but can help the people around you. Just by having a good impression of yourself people can take it to other good ways in life.

A9DA6C8A9555,"Albert Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge.""

I do agree because in your imagination you can think or do anyting you want. Knowledge is just using ur brain but it's not the same as imagination. Many people might agree with me because its just true. You can think of many ways; Therefore, all the things you think can come true but not all the time. Im going to tell you all the reason why!

Imagination is a whole new world, not many people can say that. You can create anything just by using ur brain.

In your mind think of scary movie, funny movie, and horror thing that can scare you. Sometime you can make up a plan by using ur imagination; Meanwhile, you can use ur Imagination for homework or any problem that you have at home. Think about it, you are goiign to love it.

Albert Einstein is one of the smartest people if you don't belive me read an article about him trust me. If you use your knowledge what the fun on that you can't even create nothing. Some people just say, use your knowledge for a problem instead of your imagination. knowledge is important but using your imagination is more important.

If you don't belive me belive Albert Einstien!

What would you like to use more your knowldge or your Imagination. Well think of the fun thing you can do with your Imagination. Well Albert Einstein would not have said, using your imagination is more important then knowledge. This is my opiaion but it could be your opiaion to. You need to try it, Im telling you it's so fun.

Imagination is really fun and helpfull in life; However not many people think that, Imagination fun because they never try it. Many people might think it boring and that there no point to it. But there wrong becuase how do you think that many people got out of there bubble or problem they had in school or home. Just use your imagination It might even help you in life or anywhere.

A9E9851F3E7E,"Some schools offer distance learning as an opinion for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some parents think it is a good idea for students to stay at home for education. Students should not attend classes from home. Here are the three reasons why students should not attend classes from home.

The first reason is students are just wasting time at home doing work, but they are really just playing video games or watching T.V. Also Most of the students that are home schooled can easily get distracted from Cellular devices too. What if the students have siblings, they might not have the time to do there work on time. Students at home may not have any connection. So, students will not be able to do any homework.

The second reason is students can struggle with homework. Students can focus on doing there homework or class work. But what if students are blind and can not do any work at home. If a student is blind, parents would have to hire or contact someone to help that blind student at home for some help. A student from a different country may not speak English. That also can be a struggle for a parent or gaurdian because they might not be able to afford classes at home.

The third reason is wasting money on books or classes. Most states have classes for free books or classes, but some other states might not. Parents might have not have the money for the classes or for the books. But wasting money on classes or books is not a good idea. Parents have to pay bills but what if the student needs the money for the classes.

Some schools offer distance learning as an opinion for students to attend classes from home or by video conferencing. Parents may think it is a good idea for students to stay home for education at home. Students should never attend distance learning for there education.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5
A9F7B20A9483,"On my opinion I be agree with the statement because He was one of the minister,who has more power from other's. Ms Winston had to help other's. For example giving hand and talk about what they can do. The minister Winston, had the responsibility to help others around he, and give enthusiasm to what they can do and how far they can go.

Them Let's say on my class my teacher ask to work with others I had to work and show up. For example: let's talk about work in group,help each other giving ideas to we can add on the project. The terms was tried if you fails show up and do cause there is how you can be better. If you make a mistake no problem on other time you can do more better on my opinion there is how the minister can work.

In addition there the things can Minister Winston do was talk about with others if they be agree. Because if they do not be agree with the statement was cause they had to know that and see is the achievement work successful too.

Now I take the my position on my opinion many people like me came to this country and looking for better opportunities to we don't have in our country. Also we had to learn the languages what is hard but we tried to what we can do and show up how we can be better on the future.

But many student had a long history or someone didn't graduated cause many student had to pay rent or thing to what's hard to work after school and don't have to much time to sleep, any ways we had to work hard.

Also many student show what they can do and how far they can go, Also many emigrant people came here to found a safe place to live so the mind on our country we don't many security.

Now I'M be here work hard, sometimes I like to help people when they get travel or didn't understand what we do. Also I tells them to din't do bad things cause if you get travel you get problem them your record contain a bad thing, until now I to my best it's hard sometime to understand but everyday when I be at home I practice or read book thats one thing can help everyone who want to learn more English. For example if you read a book like 20 minutes you learn and know how to pronounce that work that help you to main ten your vocabulary an read faster.

AA0919FCDEDC,"The Primer Minister Winston Churrchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" And the question is about angree or desag.

My opinion is desagree because the Primer Minister wiston not is try to motivate to onther person to do again. First,reason when something person loss manytime something and feel what if continue does again can obtain something good in the future. Because never said end. Second, reason the failure plays inthe life a paper strong in the life of every person in the world. But when any person not try more time that one is clear that is going to failure and never feel what is obtain something good in the futured. The decition every person have nothing can said what try againt. The decition is of your selft. My position is what if I whole my life said not and not continue consist in something never can obtain something.

When have the oportunity of obtain something and gain something never say I failure least when have a enthusiasm of obtain. Never person have the right to says you never can't do. forever cave you personas negatives and thoght negative in the life. But every pesona have the right to attain something. For example: I have goals in my life what is gradution and have my diploma and can continue in the college. For can gain this gold and my dream i have enthusiasn and an person positive. Also if I have failure in my gold I have of up and againt.

Form not failure has try more of one times. The reasons are clear if an have enthusiasm for something I loss the possible to go back to againt. I also think what the Prime Minister Winstor Churchill loss something for what the that try todo is what the person not continue there are and losss your enthusiasm for something what hill obtain. There are many success about failure but the failure arrive when the problem don't have solution. Becasuse also have the right to fight for obtain the solocion to the failure.

When us arrive to the failure have the right of to do again but other form. Sometime the life us play's different suitation what think that not obtain solution but many pesons said what there are form all have solution lest when an dead. These is other example when one person dead and before to dead have failure many time in yours objetives an don't know say there are fight for obtain the solution.

The life arrow as the world an never have the solution in the hand to all problems butnot signific what noy have solution. Never there are said not can't. The final of failure forever have solution. Is as when an company is goint to bankarrot. They try to share solution form the failure. For there nevere said that no can't share solution to the every failure.

My conclusion is that never lost the energy for figth for the solution. Forever cave sometihing what have hopeful in your self. No lost yor hope eve search the solution to the failure.

AA9B263544A9,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? In my opinion, I dont think the students would benefit taking classes at the comfort of their homes. That is because it's not the same thing as going to school. Taking classes at home is not the same as taking classes in school because in school you have a teacher that can help you, if you don't understand what's going on in the class. Also another reason is that in school you have a teacher that can teach the student actual lessons that the student can benefit from. Third reason is because sometimes you will just be lazy and not do the work and just do whatever you want since you're at home. No one will stop you, or give you remainders to do your work. Overall, I don't think the students would benefit from taking classes at their homes.

I would think that online classes would be harder and difficult to understand. In fact, being in a normal class you learn more and you are all catched up with your work. Being in school will help you communicate more with others, you can make or meet some new friends,the teacher will help you with some work if you need it. Online classes are harder because the student might not know what to do and he/she will be lost. Some people might find that online classes are hard and some might not it just depends on the individual. Some people just learn differently.

In conclusion everyone is different. What might work for you, might not work for the next person. Some people might benefit from talking online and some might not it. Honestly it just depends on what the students perfers online classes or school classes. I think that taking class in school is way better, teachers help you, you get better knowledge, you communicate more with others.

AB7823891008,"I think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age.

My first response is some children can commit to a career at a young age, if they want to improve and they want a good future, they have to go to school and many of children can helped from their parents.

For example; if someone want a career at young age they have to work hard, and pay attention, some time is going to be difficult for them but they can do it.

Children engage in a career at a young age to prepare themselves for their future .

Also, is a good idea for students to a career at a young age because they are improve in a good age and they thinking about their future, but in a career at young age some children want to graduated at a young age, first they have to work hard at school, and there are many way, and programs to be graduated from Hig School for a career at a young age.

In conclusion, kids who take advantage of programs, and High Schools, are qualifying these students for their lives ahead in order to have a good future with a career they want. I definitely think that programs make a positive input in these helping young life.

ABEA8B5724EF,"The World We Live in

More than 4 billion people with different culture,different background and different mentality live in our planet Earth; and each person have their own way of life style. Naturally, we have to associate our self with others, to manage our way of living. It means life push us to open our doors and see different people quality and life style. Emerson's statement "" To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" In my opinion, this is wrong. Sometimes, we have to allow our self and live other people lives. It means we have to change our face mask everyday to be a head of somebody. this will help us to avoid conflicts, to accomplish our personal goals and to live in any environment.

Sometimes, I fell like we should change the name "" world "" to "" different."" It explain the meaning a lot more. our world is different. every living matter have their own characters and identity. Birds can fly but lions can't. Plants, they can't move but we can. This can show us how our world is divided in many ways. This is leading us to conflicts and fights in every aspects. For example, we can see a political conflict between Donald Tranp and the Democrat. Personally I don,t agree with Donald Tranp's ideas and terms. But if my community agrees and supports Tranp's ideas, It is mush easier if I put a new a mask in my face and put a fake smile on top of it and pertained that i am on same track like them witch is supporting Donald Tranp. It will help to avoid conflicts between me and my community.

Every strong person uses methods to accomplish their drams and goals. focusing is one of the beast way a person use it to be on the top of everybody. strong person fight to win and to be number one no matter what the situation is. Giving up is the beget enemy in their life. Not being somebody else cannot be the reason to give up in a dream. For example, If your goal is to be number one fighter, you have to fight first. Even if you have a lover personality. If you want to be a fighter you have to fight. thats the reality. You can't love some one and punch them in the face at the time. you have to switch up to get to your dreams ( to being number one fighter). American secrete service agents go to Afghanistan to catch terrorist. They are not Muslims but they have to dress up like Muslim and learn their language and culture just to make their country safe from terrorist. Being somebody else help them to achieve there goals.

I believe, becoming somebody else, can help you to learn about that someone personality.

This can help you to adapt the behavior of that person, witch can help you to establish a good relationship. For example, I am originally from Ethiopia living in the US. Sometimes I have to act like American just to establish a good environment around me. Thanksgiving is a well know holly day in American culture . But we dont celebrate it in Ethiopia. Just to respect for my community, i celebrate thanks giving with fake smile with others just to create a good environment in my area.

In my conclusion , sometimes we should be somebody else to live in our divided society. This can also solve our conflicts , helps us to accomplish our goals and to be live in any environment. I believe we have to be logic and see the other side. This could be the smartest way to live our life with our crazy the society .                ",2.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5

Students tend to postpone work and project since there isn't a teacher physically in front of them constantly reminding them ""do your work"" or ""heads up this assignment is due next week.""

Although some may say students benefit more being home schooled they won't because they will get comfortable. Students will have the sense that they can do the work whenever they want , so therefore they won't complete the assignment. Students will later find all the amount of assignments that have to be complete will increase the student will feel overwhelmed then later fail, quit , and drop out.

School prepares you for the real world. They take in consideration attendance and responsibility. For instance a job as well requires these characteristics. If your home school your not training yourself or the mindset to adjust to being responsible.

Deligence leads us to a road of success. For example, The successful people are always willing to spend times and put efforts in their work. In history, a lot of leaders showed us that success comes from keeping doing and trying things over and over to make it what it is today.

When we become deligent, we spend our time doing meaningful things. We become more efficient and tend to be more responsible for our lifes, it pushes us forward to our destinations in a good way.

Experiencing lets us learn more. For example, We learn from books and documentaries about what other people have experienced or doing different things by ourselves then gain perspectives from it. Those things make us talented and gives us guides about how things might be when we grow up. It also gives us advantages when we encounter difficult things and try to deal with it. The more we experience, the more valuable and proficent we will be.

While some people believe that we accomplish more if we are always doing something. Other argue that inactivity also serve a purpose, for example, They say that we only live once, why give ourselves such hardtimes and do not do things that make us feel comfortable and happy. Although this may be true, it will just makes us lazy and does not give our lifes meanings and purposes.

We will accomplish more if we are always doing somthings. Deligence makes us have a positive attitude to put efforts in our works, we can become more responsible for ourselves.

You can see how different poeple think by just starting a conversation, different people might have better advice than others becase of the way they think or how they were taught to do things. Its also good to talk to the people that have been through your situation becase they have been through it and they can give you tips on how to be positive or how to be relaxed in that situition if it ever happens agian.

You can also talk to your familiy members becase they are are close people that you can always trust to help you like a project or just homework things like that so it doesent stress you out so much.

AE0DB193F5B5,"Today, in the actuality, a lot of people have a big dreams that we can to complete have a better life for our future family or also to own self but a many people be surrender becuase most of the time have the fuilures, when they are doing something; I think that our life without the fuilures will be bored and easy becuase we don't have the energies to work hard or fight for our goals or dreams. I agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because you can help other to complete their dreams or their goals, also you can have more spirit and a positives attitudes than you have in the begging, also you can be a successful and strong person.

You can help others to complete with their dreams or their goals, because sometimes a lot of people who want to comply their dreams or goals they don't have the motivation of their families or the economy necessary to buy all the studies or all the things that they need, so when you finish all the goals that you make you, you can assist to others. I know an experience of child from Mexico, his name was Generic_Name. Generic_Name was a child with the low economy resources, I remember that he toll us all the things that he was comply to get a better life for his family and him self. So one day, Generic_Name received a big notice from a presidency of Generic_City, the place were we live, that he can have a opportunity to study whatever he want. He and his family were happy for the big opportunity that Generic_Name have. At pass of the years, when Generic_Name finished study the collage, I know that Generic_Name is a big entrepreneur from a big company that he created after finished the college. Today, also Generic_Name likes help other people who want to be a successful in their life like the presidency help him. In my observation to be a good person likes Generic_Name makes that you have a lot of open opportunities to get the success or the things that Generic_Name every day was dreamed.

Also you can be a successful and strong person because all people knows that the life is not easy and less if you want to do something hard or something that you need put a lot of time in it to pursuit of success and if you think that your goals or dreams are difficult to complete. Sometimes we need strive more that the people or your mind think. Another of my experiences is when was in Mexico, I was little girl, I remember that most of my days I talked with my family, my mother, my father and also sometimes with my grandfathers; about that I want study the High School in Untied States because I saw a TV Shows and movies shows all the schools and also my father lived a lot of years in this country so, he talk me about the schools, the teachers, the classmates, the classes and classrooms that were to different form my country, the lunch time and I think that the thing that was more exercise was with the lockers because in my country don't have lockers or something to put our things likes books, pencils, notebooks and sometimes, the food. At the time that was grow up, I was continue with the same mentality to come to this country to comply my studies. I remember that have a lot of failures in the time to the arrival to United States but,even if never let that my thoughts or the commentaries of the negative people will be fell bad about my big dream. I think that was a strong person because is hard to come to other place with different culture and customers in everything and also is hard and sad separate to the persons who love.

Other might say that the importance role that failure plays in the pursuit of success does not matter or they are disagree because you can lose your forces to continue and accomplish your goals and sometimes this failure can make us fell sad. However, you can have more spirit and positives attitudes than you have in the begging because when you have a failure in something that you study a lot or put your all time in it, you can have the mentality that you can to do well it, just you need strive a little be more that you make before. This is one of my experiences in my life; the last week, in my History class with Generic_Name, we have a quiz form the first unit so, we did the quiz, but the majority of my classmates and me, we don't pass the quiz, my teacher talked with us to give us a another opportunity to pass it. A lot of my classmates tell her that they do not were think that they can pass it even though they study a lot before the retake but, I have the spirit and the positives attitudes that I can passed the quiz with a good grade and study well at home. I think that my experience, it is good example because a lot of people who want to complete their dreams does not matter the times that they need to try to get a good result and a good recompense for the effort that they make.

In my opinion, I think that Churchill's statement ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" it is important and I agree with it because you can motive other people to be a good person with good feelings and goals, another reason is because you can to be a successful and respectful person and you can have a good attitudes through haved a bad results, every time you need stay be happy. Most of the people we have the big goals to comply something that always we dreaming.",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5

One of the activities that one can do outdoors is going to the community park to have some fun alone or with their family to enjoy the environment and leave their life the way they want to, also they can take their dog with them and have fun with them some of the activities they can be doing with the dog is training them how to jump,catch things,and also how to make friends with other dogs in the area of the park they are. and also if they go alone they can also have some alone time on their own or even make friends with other people who also brought their dogs with the,and by this they will have some fun outdoors and also find that going to the park was a fun idea.

Another way to have fun or spend time outdoors is to go to the beach on your free time to clear your mind from all the things you did on workdays like from Monday to Friday,having al those kind of stuff on your shoulder at work I think that this will be the best time to go to go to the beach. But if you think that in your opinion that my first point I made about going to the beach was not the best idea then i think the second point may be the best reason why someone will have interest in going to the beach. The main reason why someone will go to the beach is to have the best time of his or her life or maybe find someone that the person is attractive to when they go to the beach.",3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0
AEEEF8816516,"Technology is a tool for the human to amuse because people can check out books,shop, and play games without speaking to another person, but at the same time technology effects on people's lives. Here are some negative and positive reasons that technology cause to the people.

Many people lost their time with play games, for example, 75% of childhood and young play games every day thats means that more than 1 million of kids take their time with games, so the consequence of the future of this generation can be different because right know children's starts to loss communication with parents or starts to be aggressive with others. thats a negative reason.

Now, technology helps a lot because makes more easy on people's lives. for example, During the time technology creased every day, exist apps that you can use for jobs and apps that you can use to contact others easier. On this times young people study about photograph, edition, effects, agriculture and more because that is the feature, but we need to be careful because if we carelessness the future can be horror.

The technology is too important for the world. There is positive reasons and negative reasons it just depends what you care more, Technology or the world, and i'm not saying that we need to eliminated the technology. I'm just thing that we need to be care for this if we want a good feature, So one thing we can do is to get more communicate, friendship, share with people, go outside, visit the nature. If we still do those things our feature will be pretty good.

AF71C89CD199,I think this pogram should be in every school beacuse this could help the younger students to learn more about the school. And the older students can the younger students and they can show them which room they have to go. And its better this way beacuse the older students knows more things about the school then the younger students do. And this could help the younger students learn more about the school. This will make the students feel about their seld beacuse they were helping other younger students. Now the srudents feel more comfortable beacuse they got helped from the other students from the other students so now the younger students feel way happier beacuse they know where to go. And if this was not a thing students will be all sad and fustrated beacuse they will be all lost beacuse they new to the school and wont have no one to help them. The younger students going to be really sad beacuse they wouldnt know what to do and what class they have to go. So this a reason of why every older students should help new kids at the school or any younger students. And the younger students gonna learn from the older students and this pogram can help the younger students get their grades up beacuse older students can help them do they work and get their grades up,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5
AFFCB27334C9,"Have you ever felt board, or idle? Thomas Jefferson ones wrote,"" Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I strongly agree with Thomas, because when I'm feeling idle. I intend to get sad, or depressed, therefore never be idle.

Theres a lot of ways you can stay active and not be board out of your mined, for example; over the summer my Dad took me to work with him, as a carpenter. But not every one can do that, therefore here's some ideas for you: go to a gym, go for walks ,or get a job.

Going to the gym might be a big comment, but its very healthy physically and mentally, you'll start feeling good about your self, maybe even start looking good too. this is my first idea in how to stop being idle.

My second idea is walking. Walking was something that helped me fined my peace, just walking around admiring the world, breathing in the fresh air; now i'm not saying to do it alone maybe with a friend or two, or maybe walk your dog. pretty must enjoy the beautiful world that gods given us.

My third and last idea is to find a job. Working with my Dad has given me a lot of money, I bought nice shoes, cloths and bought my family things too, but it wasn't just about the money. Working with my Dad really has given me another way to look at life, gave me a reason to change my ways and made me see that the real life isn't easy. And its amazing to see the building now, to see how much its improved from last time i was there and now its just like a maze to me.

This is why I believe its never okay to be board, or idle. Because just imagine all the things you can get done, therefore, this is was i think Thomas Jefferson right when he said,"" it is wonderful how much you can get done if we are always doing.""

B04F96DEDE6B,"Once someone told me,"" Focus on your goals, and keep focusing until you reach them, it does not matter if it takes long, at the end of the day it will worth it "". I think it is a good idea if you identify the carrer that you want to take and start getting into it at a young age, because you will have more time to know and study about it and how it works, and it is gonna be more easy. It could be difficult if at the end of the day you are about to gratuate and you do not even know what career do you wanna take.

One of the reasons why you have to decide what career you wanna take by the time you enter high school is that, you will focus in all your classes, but more in those classes that are related with your career, and you progress in school is gonna increase, and also your grades. You will be busy in a productive way doing things that will benefit you in school, because if you really wanna reach your goals you will not have chance to waste your time,

which is a good thing, instead doing nothing, bad thing, or only in video games. As how we are today, many teens are leaving school because maybe they think they found a better thing to do or because they took a bad decition.

But for those who really wanna be someone in the future and go for it, will have more opportunities, like Univercities credits and in their future job by dedicating their interest in school and doing their best.

Another reason is that your knowledge is gonna increrase, which is also a good thing, because you will learn a little bit about everything. In any career, you have to know about everything, even if it is a little bit, but you will learn new interesting things every days, things that you did not know before, and your interest in those things will drive you to search more about it and make you feel that you wanna know more and more about anything you are learning. All those are benefits that you can get by dedicating your interest in school.

In conclution, I think all students should have an idea of what career they wanna take, by the time they enter high school , so their courses of study in high school can help them when they are ready to go to the University, to not be difficult learn about it.",3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0
B067F0CBE15C,"Having students take courses during the summer to graduate in three years isn't a great idea. The reason why I think it isn't a great idea is, students might need more credit to graduate, some students have jobs during the summer and could feel stressed workng and going to school at the same time, and students like to take a year break off school.

First reason why I think it isn't a good idea is because, students might need more credit and need to take more classes. if they where to want to do it but didn't have enough credit they would have to double up there classes and doing that, can make them feel stresssed and pressured. Three years of high school isn't enough, in four years a student can join a club, play a sport and have regular classes and not feel over whelmed, and doing all that can make he/she look good when looking at what college to go to. But if a student wanted to do all that while having way to much classses could make them feel over whelmed.

Second reason why, students have jobs when they start high school. We all people like to have money in are pockets and students get there money by working during the summer. But how can a student have a job and go to school, it gives less time for the student to do his hobi which is working. In the summer a student wants to work to save up for a car or for college, it's the only time a student doesn't have to worry about school, they could just be focusing on saving up to go to a good college.

Last but not least, at the end of the school year students like to go ahead and go to college but some might want a break to make money or think about what they want to do or just want a break of school. Having a break gives you time to work full time somewhere and save up for something you need like, a car, a house, or money for colllege. It takes time for you to be successful in life which is why you should take things slow and not make yourself stressed and tired doing everything fast.

In conclusion, students who graduate in three years instead of four years, isn't a great idea. Students might need more credit to graduate, some might have jobs during the summer and if they where to take classes they could feel stressed, and some students like to take a year break from school and would want to be working making money for them to buy needs.

B18CF330D3CD,"One thing I would like to accomplish is to lose weight for three big reasons. The first big reason is to do it for my health. The second reason is that I want to inspire other people that might be overweight and give them hope that they can lose weight. My Third and final reason is that losing weight is just better for me in general it would boost my self esteem and help me be not so self conscious.

To better explain my first reason I will talk more about it. The reason was that losing weight would be better for health. You see bad things can happen to you when you are overweight such things as diabetes that is a sickness that is a result of being overweight. Some overweight people find it difficult to walk or to do something simple because they are carrying all that extra weight on them. In fact i sometimes find it hard to do exercises in gym class that most people would find easy to do. There are many heath risks when it comes to being over weight and thats one of the reasons I want to lose weight.

The second reason I want to lose weight is because I would like to inspire other people that are overweight to try and lose wight. If I lost weight that could encourage other people to lose weight as well because they can say to themselves a person who was were I am lost weight and I can do the same. I have a saying it's ""when you help someone you help everyone"" an example for that saying would be if I helped someone want to lose weight they might feel the need to help other lose weight. So I hope that I could influence a sort of butterfly effect starting with me inspiring someone to lose weight and that person inspiring someone else and so on and so on. If I lose weight knowing that I lost weight not only helping myself but also others I would be proud of myself.

My third and final reason to lose weight is that it would be better for my self esteem and help me be not so self conscious. If you have any insecurities than you know what is like to want to get rid of those insecurities. One of my many insecurities is my weight and I think that if I got rid of that insecurities it would better my self conscious and make me think good about myself. I just plainly think that I would be better off losing weight because I would think better of my self.

In conclusion one thing I want to accomplish in life is lose weight. There are several more reasons I could list but those are my main and biggest reasons I want to lose weight. I want to lose weight because it's healthy,because I want to inspire people to do the same,and because I want to boost my self esteem. Losing weight is the one thing I want to do in life and helping others is also something I love doing.",5.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5
B1BF25C4C28B,"My mom always tell me "" keep going until you reach your goals, never stop"".

I believe that if we are always doing something we can accomplish more than we can imagine.

First of all, you should never give up on something, it might not work the first time but if we are working consistently on it, one day it will became a reality. For example, when I started 11th grade I was not doing well in Chemistry. I remember each day getting into the class and always starting with a warm-up about moles. The teacher gave us about ten minutes to solve the problems because they were easy, however; I always got almost all of them wrong. Almost all my classmates knew how to solve them, so I was too embarrassed to ask question in front of the class. My friend who's also in Chemistry, understood how to do those problems and much more about chemistry, so I asked her to help me. With her help

I was able to do the problems on my own because she taught step by step on how to do them. As a result, my grades improved a lot. If I'd decide to just let it passed I would've never been able to see how far I could have gotten get if I always keep trying.

Second of all, you should always go as far as you can, never stop at on point just because you think is worthless or you're are not going to make it. For example, the women who's my manager at a fast food restaurant she started as a employee. Most of the coworkers told her that it was going to be challenging for her to be a manager .They were trying to make her stop doing something she wanted to do for her future, they told her to just stay there and see what happens next. Instead, of listening to what people were saying, she worked really hard and accomplish a lot more than she could be able of. If you really want to make something happen, you should always have to work for it, and not think it will just happen as a miracle.

Third of all, some people may argue that doing something over and over again will never work, however; many people are able to prove that this statement is not true. For example, in a TV show about a girl who was always working toward getting into collage failed many times, but she never gave up. Because of her hard work and desire to keep working no matter what, one day she got accepted into a really privileged collage. By always doing something and never giving up is the key to accomplish everything.

To conclude, in order to get something you should never stop working for it. Most celebrities and rich people are where they're now because they always are doing something to make their dreams true and if at one point they had stopped I don't think they would've been successful. This world is full of opportunities but only those who always are working and never stopping are able to take advantage of it. ",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0

Some say Churchill go from failure to failure without loss enthusiasm because sometimes people feel shy when they are doing somehing that they don't want to do, like me. I'm so shy when I have to do presentations, I don't feel confortable. But we have to get out our fears, that are killing us to not do what we have to do.

B204869FA146,"Is technology a positive or negative effect on human life? Technology is a negative effect on all human life because it is a limitation on communication. With technology there is no talking to others, so you become socially awkward. You would not be able to talk infront of a crowd and you do not go out to meet new people.

People become socially awkward by not having the practice to communicate with others. You can not spend the rest of your life shopping online hiding from people. People who do not socialize hide their face when speaking, they can not even order food without getting shy. It is sad how the world is relaying on technology to do everything for them. Something that is amazing is having someone to talk to in person. You would be able to see their emotions and feel their energy when you are talking to them. People are not their just to listen but to also give advice to you. I do not think technology does the same. It does not ask how was your day or how are you feeling because it is not human it is a robot.

When you do not talk to enough people in your life you start to become shy. You will start to realize that in almost every job you need to talk in front of a crowd of people. Even if you can not do that you will have to because that is part of your job just to communicate. That is why in school they start to teach you at a very young age how to communicate. Teachers asign presentations for the students to get comfortable talking to others. Practice is the best way to handle talking to others because talking through the phone and in real life are two different things. When talking on the phone you do not need to see the person you are talking to or you can even just hang up. But in real life you have to learn how to start a conversation with someone and keep the conversation going.

People do not go out to find new friends. Yes, it is awkward going up to someone and saying, do you want to be friends. But that is where it all starts by making one friend you have achived a lot because now you have a friend that you can talk to and not feel alone. You can not stay at home just being online. You should ask your friend do you want to go watch a movie or go eat. That is better then staying at home a playing games all by yourself. Yes, you can talk with your friends and play games at the same time but it is also important to change things up a little bit. Just once in a while find something else to do rather than sitting at home. You can do a sport. You communicate a lot when playing a sport. Being at home you are just surounded but technology and you would never really get away from it if you do not try. Another thing: making friends on socail media is not the same as in person. There might even be a chance you never meet the person you met online or might not even be the person you thought they would be in person.

In conclusion even though technology is a great way to communicate with others that are long distance. It is still important to communicate face to face. Even if it is just for a couple of minutes you should still have someone to talk to. So that later on in your life if you get a job that involves you talking to a crowd you would not be scared. Also going out once in a while is not bad. You should not just stay at home playing games with your friends asked them do you want to go for a walk then you could talk to them in person. It is always a good thing to stay away from technology just somethings. There are other things that you can do even alone. You can read a book, sketch and color, or even just have a nice relaxing walk just to think. Technology should not stop you from having a good life and communicating with others. Just remember technology to some people is everything but to you it should not be.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

B3B9D116021C,"People tend to think that setting a goal high to achieve is a smart idea. While the other side thinks that setting a goal low is the better. Although some people may hate setting a goal high and falling short, it can cause a person to give up, but they forget to neglect the part that goals or achievements come in different shapes and sizes. People should be aiming their achievements high because people can achieve more, people can feel more motivated, and people can feel more successful.

Some people may not agree with this position because setting a goal to high and then falling short can cause a person to feel less motivated. they believe this because when setting a goal high and it fails, it can make a person give up and not try. they may think this because when giving up on a goal it can cause a person to feel empty and wanting to not try again. this shows that some people are afraid of failing, and when they do fail it makes them not try again. However, the oppositions looks over other important points.

People should be aiming their achievements high so they can achieve more. when a person sets their goal high, it could mean they are setting multiple goals and not just one, having one goal is great, but having multiple is also fantastic. this can also make the person feel good about themselves, knowing that they have accomplished more than one achievement. it can also make them feel proud about themselves. Even if a person failed one goal that doesn't mean they can't accomplish other goals. People cannot accomplish every goal, all goals are different then one another, but other harder goals can be accomplished.

people should be aiming their achievement high because it can make a person feel more successful. Once a person has completed an achievement it can make them as if they succeeded. it can also help with their confidence, it would give them less anxiety. it also shows that the person who is working towards his or her achievement can do so much more. it can also help some people in the future because they have the confidence they need because they hit different goals. people can also feel like they did something with their life and not feel like they did not accomplish anything in life.

People should aim their achievements high because they can feel more motivated. Setting an achievement means working really hard. It means you must focus on, it should be the only thing you are working on. Most people in their mind focus on this and this is what motivates them to work on one persons goal. In their brain they get this sense of energy, their brain is telling them to work on their goal. that is what make some people want to work towards their goal or try to finish their goal.

So this is why aiming your goal high is a good thing, motivation, success and achieving more can help a person in life if trying complete an achievement. People can get scared of goals, they are afraid it could fail something could go wrong, but the thing is in life you will fail, nobody is perfect, people will have get over their fears and accomplish their goal.

B4994C771190,"Do you think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

I don't think the students would get benefits from being able to attend clasess from home. First, the students not have somebody like a teacher to tell what to do and no body give pressuare. For example: if the student don't want to do what the student have to do no body tells nothing. Second, the student who takes oline classes will not have any friends or somebody to talk. For example: Everybody want any friend or somebody who can we talk if you do stay at home you never meet someone and never know somebody. Third, the student maybe can get frustate to be lonely at home. For example: if the student take oline classes and watch videos conferencing maybe will be boring and the studend get stress in another part if the student take the classes at school he be with friends or somebody to talk. Next, if the student stay at home the student can do whatever the student want to do. For example: if the student want to play video games the student can do that and if the student want to sleep he can do that too because the student will not feel with any responsability also, if the student wants to go outside he can do that because the student will be at home and maybe their parents work all day. Finally, if you take the classes at home and never came to school you cannot live the experinces that we live at school. For example: if you take a classes at home you cannot participate in any activity that the school have like a any sport or party or any activity that one is so funny and you can enjoy the activities with you friend or teachers who always are there for us to lisen if you have any problem and the techer are like a secret box because you can tell whatever you want and they never tell to someone. That's why I think is nice to get classes at school and I think is not so good to take classes at home because you can get more fun at school and is a experince that you will never forget.

In another part if you did not want to get school because someboby bother you like if another student tell you a nickname that you di not like maybe can be a reason that you did not want came to school but you can took with you adviser or your's parents because every body have a opportunity to be at school and anybody can't tell you anything.

B4CF5269C465,"Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early?. Some students take courses during the summers or in the evenings or may not be able to take elective courses that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. It would be a bad idea as students need more preparation before go to college, because students need advanced classes, time to know what they want and get more opportunities that help them in college.

Some Students dont be prepared go to college when they graduated. because some people know college is more difficult than schools. for example: My sister graduate early to high school and go to college, when she take the test she dont know the answers; because ask to her about classes that she never see in high school, she lost the test and she had to pay for take that classes before to start with her profession. Is it not a good idea to graduated early as students can get all credit in high school and star to take more advanced classes that they need to college.

Some students take one year more in high school to take advanced classes. For example: my best friend dont have the money to pay college and they want to get a scholar ship in high school, he has all the credits and sol's that he need to graduate, but he take another year; because he want to take advanced classes like physics or difficult classes that he need in college, and is it opportunity to learned classes that you need in college free. but if a students have just three years to graduated when they go to college they dont know nothing classes that they really need.

It would be a bad idea to allow students to graduated in three years as they dont be prepared to the college. students need to experiment elective classes and find what they want because some students when graduated dont know what they want to do after graduated. some people said is better go to college one year early and be professional early however a good professional is not who get all diplomas early is who have the more experience and know more about that.

In conclusion, allow students to graduated early is a bad idea. students need prepared more before go to the college and get time to take the opportunities to take advances classes or get scholar ships that they really need in college.

B727B720430B,"To whom it may concerned:

For me, Policy 1 is better, base from my own opinion. Because Policy 1 would be better from Policy 2. For students to avoid breaking the rules of their own school, Policy 1 would be the better choice. Because they can use their phones during their break, lunch periods and whenever they have a free time. In some cases, most students and parents prefer to have the Policy 1 so that whenever they have an emergency or an important thing to do so, they can easily contact each other, except for contacting each other inside their classes.

As long as their phones are in silence or they won't be using it during their class time, Policy 1 is a good choice. And for me, Policy 1 is the best choice among all of the choices that the principle would have. For students, having Policy 1 could be nice. I think they would really appreciate it if they would be having that policy. Because if in some reason, Policy 2 would be the one that the Principle will be choosing, there's a possibility that a lot of students will make a way to break the rule just to bring their gadgets, even though they might get into trouble. But, students must know their limitations whenever they use their phones or gadgets inside the campus.

Students shouldn't be using it whenever the teacher is discussing or whenever they're inside their classrooms. Because, instead of learning a lot of things from the school, they would just waste their time using those gadgets. I hope that you understand me why I chose Policy 1 rather than the other Policy which is the second choice. Because I know how it feels like when you don't have your phone by your side and didn't noticed that something emergency from your family is happening. I wish you would be considering or approving my opinion. I choosing the right opinion so that won't have any alibis for breaking the rule of your school.

While other people might think that if you keep working hard, and there will be one day that you can get successful. Because you did not give up for this things, however this is a wrong way to thinking, the reason behind this is yes it is ture that if you are keep working and do not give up then you might be become a successful person but It's still depend on what kind of ways are you choice to go. if you choice a wrong way to go then you get a big mistake, you have to start all over again, that's wasting time.

Other reasons that behind people think they should keep working are it can let people have the spirit about do not give up and have brave to try something. But people will get lost when they working to hard, they do not know what should to do, and if they failed about what they doing now, they will be worry about next time when they want to do something, they became afired to try.

B7AABB24BDB8,"Yes,we accomplish more if we are always doing something rather that doing inactivity. If we keep on doing something to accomplish it then victory is always near to us. Our continious work to accomplish any task will be paid later by our better results. Hard work and dedication always lead us towards the success so does if we are always doing something to accomplish the task. Doesn't it sound foolish that inactivity also serve the purpose. It somehow can help to accomplish taking much time but not the same way like if we are always doing somethng.

There is a famous saying that ""Rome was not built in a day"". Here the people were always working for many years to built Rome into a beautiful city. We can see their hard work and dedication really worth it as it is one of the most beautiful city among the world. Would it have been possible if they were doing inactivity? Obvioulsy no nah? Doesn't it sound foolish that inactivity also serve the purpose. It somehow can can help to accomplish taking much time but not the same way like if we are always doing somethng. As ""Where there is will there is the way"" in the same way if we really want something then we can achieve it if we keep on working and always do something for that. I can support it by saying that failure will never ever take you if your determination towards success is strong enough and keep workng for it.

Let's take an example of two students. if two students are assigned a long project in the summer vacation and one student started working from the mean day so that it will be easier from him to complete before the due date whereas the other one kept on realxing thinking that he will start working on it at the last of vacation. Now all of us what the result gonna come. One student happily submitted the project accomplishing it before the due date and the other one had to suffer a lot. So which one would you prefer accomplishing by always doing something in the right time or rushing to complete task in due time.

So,in my opinion always doing something to accompish more is better idea than thinking that inactivity also serve a purpose. No one want to rush to complete any task at the due time so we should be always doing somehing to accomplish more. Slow and steady always wins the race but it doen't mean to say that doing work slowly will worth it everytime. I mean that you should be always doing something in oder to accomplish in time. We can learn lesson from tortoise and rabbit story. From tortoise side,like topic says we should be always doing something to accomplish more or in time in the same way tortoise kept on walking for the race although he can't run having faith in himself that he can do it. From rabbit side we shouldn't do mistake to think our competetors not strong enough than you. We should always respect your competetors thinking that they are as stronger as you and keep doing our assesments to be the most deserving one of that victory. We should have strong believe in ourselves that I can do it then nothing seems impossible.

In conclusion,last but the least I would like to end up saying that if we are always doing something then we can accomplish more compare to the one who works inactively. Time is the most important key factor in our life. Once it is gone it is gone for forever..So,the key point is we should understand the importance of time and utilize it properly and make it effective by always doing something which leads us to the accomplishment of our task.",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5

B942E0DA6A0F,"I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, it is best to be yourself than to be someone you're not. You won't have to meet some jobs perspectives. You won't have to be someone you're not. You can have many accomplishments throughout your life.

The first reason as to why I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson is because, when it comes to jobs it can be real tough for some people. Some job's ask who you really are as a person, once you let them know they don't like the response. But, there are some job's that will accept you and will like who you are truly.

Second of all don't have to be someone you're not. You shouldn't have to please others only because they don't like who you are as an individual. Some might even say that its for the best when in reality it isn't. You shouldn't have to be the opposite of who you are just so you don't get judged on. Pay no attention to those who don't accept you for being nothing but yourself, and don't change for them unless you're doing it for you. You should always please yourself no matter what.

Lastly like Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" That writing is nothing but the absolute truth. Your individuality can bring you so much success. It can take you places you can't even imagine. Being yourself can benefit you as a person, people can perhaps like even love the real you. You can become a role model to those who are having trouble on deciding if they should be themselves or be what this world want's them to be. People could admire you and accept you even more.

In conclusion I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson because it is best to be you own individual self than not, because you won't meet jobs perspectives, be someone you're not, and also it comes with amazing accomplishments. Some think otherwise because the believe that it would make life more simple and easy. Also you might find that being your own individual self gets you no where. ",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5

For example from my point of view I think students should come to school. Because is more helpful for them they get help from their teachers. They communicate with others share their thoughts. If their having problems with their assignment they can ask for help.

B9B71CEE162B,"This is a very important important subject to me Thank You fore giving me the opportunity write about it. In my opinion i believe that graduating in four years is a lot better than, graduating in three years. The traditional four years of high school does not put the student under pressure, unlike the three year plan. The four year plan allows the student to have some elective classes. The three year plan helps students graduate faster but it also, it does not give people time to enjoy the summer or have free time to do their favorite hobby.

High school is the best time of every student's life, because in high school students do not have a lot of responsibilities. Students who decide to pick the three year plan will be making a big mistake. Students might not be able to have any elective classes, these classes are made to be easy classes that help student do their favorite hobby like playing guitar, piano and sports, these type of classes help students remove the stress from their brains by doing something they like. I am pretty sure that students who do the four year traditional plan will be doing better in school because they are not pressured, unlike the other students with the three year plan. I was born in Egypt i moved to the United States in 2015, which was my freshman year of high school. I had to take all the mandatory classes in my first year in order to be able to graduate on time. I was not able to take any elective classes, which put me under pressure and made feel bad, because of the amount of homework and the number of hours i used to sit in my room and study.

Students in high school should be enjoying their lives. Students who do the three year plan do not have time to enjoy their lives with their family all year long, because they will have to study in order to pass their class and graduate. We all know that social life is important to every single one of us and, it affects how we do in school. Students who do the three year plan do not have time to do anything but study and do school related stuff which causes a lot of people depression and anxiety. Last year one of my closest friends had to do summer school, every time i call him he barley answers and says that he can not hang out because he got school related work to do. My friend used to hangout with me all the time but he did not because he had to go to summer school, he was telling me that he was not happy be cause he would wake up go to school finish school, go straight to work, come back from work do his homework and sleep, he barley had time to eat, which made him very tired mentally and physically.

Some of the students in high school are independent, they live on their own have a job and dont ask parents for money. Independent students can not do the three year plan because the will not have any time to do anything other than work and school. For example i have a job i live on my own and i do not as my parents for any money or anything in order for me to do the three year plan i will have to quit my job, so i can be able to focus on school or else i will fail in school and not be able to graduate and if quit my job i will have no source of income to take care of myself and pay for my rent, but i do the four year traditional plan and i have a good job where i can focus on both school and my job so i can live.

In conclusion the three year plan is not a very good decision to make and everyone should think twice before deciding on it. The three year plan does not let students have their free time to hand out with their friends or do their favorite hobby. That plan also does not give people time to have time with their family or the people they love. The three year plan will not give you time to have a job if you need one. I believe by going to high school for four years students will be able to get more experience and enjoy the best time of their lives. Thank you.",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0
BA6FC6ECE68E,"Some school districts have been offering programs that are allowing high school students to graduate a year early instead of the regular four years. In my opinion most students who agree with this and actually want to graduate a year early just do it to get school out of their way. They choose to take courses in the summer than a nice trip to a beach or hang out with some friends. I mean who wouldn't want to graduate a year early right? but in the end it's not even worth it.

I know that school may not be all fun and games but all that education and knowledge sure does take you far in life. Graduating a year earlier than your other classmates doesn't make you more than them, it doesn't make any student seem smart, it's just them taking the short cut to end school.

I believe it isn't a good idea for students to graduate a year early. I say this because senior year just brings more new experiences to your life. Also you get more opportunities to get a little taste of a few colleges when they come to the schools. You get help with your resume's, and just things that prepare you for a good future. Senior year is the ""best"" year as some students say. Graduating a year early, just makes you miss all those nice and fun experiences with friends, including the activities the school does that last year. Some students may not agree with this but senior year just gives you that extra push into making your future better. The last year of high school is like the guide to the beginning of your new life as an adult with more goals to be accomplished.

Another reason why I dont think it's a good idea for students to just take the ""easy""way out is because some students just do it to end their school life. I believe that the students who'd want to graduate a year earlier would be the ones who skip class, don't do their work, are always late to school and so on ,but to make it clear I was just referring to the bad influenced kids. High school isn't a race and neither is who has the best things in life because those you earn them by your hard work. Some students end up not even going to college, they just go straight into the workforce. Being one of those students who get to graduate a year early, it literally doesn't make you cool. I personally think that going straight to the workforce isn't the best option because to be honest, they just end up working in a Chick-fil-A, McDonalds, Burger King and all those jobs that don't even pay well. An education can get you a job! A job that'll pay you well and something that you know you'll have as a secure job and not having to change every other month or every three months.

For those students who are planning on finishing high school in three years they must have a plan whether or not they plan on still getting into a college. If some of those students still plan on going to college then they should be aware that some colleges may expect four years of high school. Also colleges may look on your school record and just see the type of person you were and may not accept you. All this coming to a close that not all colleges will be acceptable of you only having to do three years of high school. For those who don't plan on going to college, they have to have a better plan for them to survive in the real life. Some students just don't take the school serious but only if they knew that, that's the key for them to open to get to their future.

If I were agree with school districts allowing students to finish school a year early, I'd think about the positive side it has. I believe that some students may actually do it because they love school that much that they'd want to get a head start with their career. That's good I'm not saying it's bad, it's just something I wouldn't do. Students who are more than prepared should be the ones graduating early. Only students who have had perfect attendance and do their work and get good grades should only get that opportunity.

In conclusion, school districts should not allow high school kids to graduate a year early. They have to earn it and demonstrate their hard work. Senior year is the last little push a high school student gets before starting a new chapter of their life. School may not be the best but it can sure give you the best career life.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,5.0,4.0
BB0157B70CA5,"Homework can be hard most of the time, and you need someone to help you with it. Having an afterschool homework club can be fun and a good thing to do in school. An afterschool homework club can be good for the kids that don't get to finish their homework or don't understand the homework. On the other hand, we have the people that don't have time to do things after school.

An after school homework club would not be good for some of the students. People don't always have the time to do something after school. They have other things that they have to do like, practicing for a sport, dance, sing, learning an instrument it could be anything the problem is that they don't have enough time to do homework, even when they get home. An afterschool homework club is good for the kids that don't have nothing to do for the afternoon so they can stay and finish homework from that day or something that they need to finish.

I am one of those people who is against the afterschool homework club. Sometimes I need to go to preactice, so I don't have time to finish my homework but, I try my best to finish it and turn in the homework the next day. Teachers might don't have the time to stay after school too, because they have things to do like if they have a pet they have to give it food so it won't starve or have kids and they need to take care of them so nothing bad happens to them. So that is another reason why they should not have afterschool homework club.

Most of the students won't have a ride back home because their parents can be working, they can be sick, or they are not home. I don't think the school is gonna take care of all the students that go to the afterschool homework club. That is another reason why afterschool homework club is not good. What if the kids get hungry while begin in the afterschool homework club. I don't think the school is going to have food. If the school is thinking about making a club they could make it at the last class so the students take that block so they can only do homework.

It would be better if the school makes the club at the last class of the day so the students take that block for only to finish homework. So the students that don't have time after school won't struggle about not finishing their homework at time because, they have other activities to do after school. It could be good too so everyone can take a little break of the day they had. This could help a lot so, if theachers have things to do like, grade papers or homework to check they can take that block to do all of that.

Another good idea could be, that they can make the club at fist block, at the start of the day, like if one of the students never did their homework last night they still have time to finish it in the morning before they go to class. My favorite one was the one in the last class because, everyone gets a little break even the teachers. Everyone gets to finish their homework and no one has worrys about not finishing their homework and have a little bit of more free time in the afternoon.",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
BB18A75AC035,"Work requires a lot of concentration. At Generic_School, I prefer to work alone because I do what I think, no body interrupt me and I concentrate better when I am by myself. I will give three reason and examples about why I think working alone is better than working with a group.

To follow at what my brain tells to me is the best decision I can ever do. I remember one time when I was in middle school, I was working with a group of five students. That day the teacher told us to make a surprise to the children with cancer. I had an idea to make a letter and a big poster with some illustrations to make those children happy, but we didn't because my partners didn't want to make the poster and we only did the letter. that's why I always believe that is better to work alone.

In my English class, the other day teacher made some groups, and each group had to make an essay about the contamination of earth. I was in a group of four, I was trying to do my best by reading a book about earth and what causes earth get pollution, when one of my partners stopped me by removing the book that I had, that made me really angry, and now that makes me over thinking that working alone is one of the best choice that one person can make.

I remember the last year here at Generic_School, Generic_Name my health teacher told the class to make some groups for presentations about drugs and its diseases that these can cause. And also, each group have to pick their topic about what are you going to present she said. I asked her if I could make the presentation by myself and she told me that I can, but it may be difficult for you because it is hard to explain in front all your partners she said. I did my presentation about the alcohol, and she congratulated me because the hard work that I did.

She told me that she was glad about me because I did the best presentation from the class. That's why I always prefer to work alone, so no body can interrupts what I think.

In conclusion, these years really changed my point of view because now I think that working alone is one of the best choices that a human can make because it makes a person over think and believe more in their self. Now I am ready to continue with this adventure. ",3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0
BB38DB117F33,"In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. People who start a career can make it happen. Students who took it early can ask their counsler for advices. Many students believe that starting a career at a young age is a good idea because students can go to college after their courses, students can get a job after college, and students doesn't have to worry about making one in the future. Starting a career at a young age is a bad idea because it can cause students to quit their courses, it can cause lots of thinking to make one, and it can cause waste of time.

Students will quit their courses. For instance, when ever they went to class and took it for three weeks, they will usually give up. Furthermore, it can cause people to lose interest about their career. Teens who quit their courses, they have a hard time because it was difficult for them to keep up. Therefore, it is important to think first before taking that class.

It can cause lots of thinking to make one. For example, it takes time for adults to make their career. In addition, they will mostly think about getting a job first. Adults will usually think about getting a job because they want to earn money first. Not only that, adults like to spend time with their friends, but they make their career after they get paid enough to start their life.

It can cause waste of time. In fact, kids will spend time playing video games than making a career. Moreover, they think that career is school related. When making a career, kids will often write ""don't know"" and they will usually get back to their hobby. Thus, it is essintial to make a plan first before making a career at a young age.

Making a career at age of twelve or under is careless because it made people over think, it made them go back doing something, and it can cause them negative towards their courses. When ever they took their class about two ore three weeks, they usually will give up. Kids will often write ""don't know"" on their career paper. Making a career will take time for people to make, but don't give up easily if they can't pace up.",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0

Sometimes our character is formed by influences beyond our control,and that's okay everyone has diffrent reasons to be mad or to be sad,happy but we can change it if we want to. The British naturalism and politician John Lunnock was right about what he wrote,this helps a lot of people to understand that if someone do,did,say,or have said something to you ,it'll be our choice to get mad,sad,or just ignore what happened..

After that your character it'll be what you choose to make it.

For example,i've been trought a lot this past years ,my chilhood was not the best i did not had a father or my mom when i was a little girl,i grew up with my grandparents my uncle raped me when i was seven years old,my other unclu he used to hit me all the time in my head,my grandma used to hit me with the belt , i was fat when i was a little girl,and people used to make fun of me,

That really affect me ,because i'm unsecure about my body,or how i look,i've in Hospitals because i try to kill myself last year,because i was depressed,because all the things that i've been trought and now i choose to be happy,im going to therapits on Monday's,i started working ,i play soccer,or i go out with my sister.

I have choose to be happy .

Sometimes it's hard to be happy,even that you know you want to be happy you just don't see one reason to be,and it's sad because you know your family it's feeling the same pain you feel inside of you ,the only thing you think in those moments are, ""why would i do this"" or ""why am i trying so hard "" .

Those are the worst feelings,when you want to get up in the morning but you can't.

A lot of student have troubling time to find what career they want to have many student career doesn't end so well, once they enter high school student can find what career to have in the future, student can even visit a website to see what career are intresting for them or can visit careers search in school..

If i have to choose a career at a young age i would not think of anything because i haven't find what career i'm intresting in also, it'll be better i enter high school and find what career i like and enjoy because thinking of what career i want would be hard at a young age also, i can talk to a teacher about career in high school so they can help me of what career are available that are right for me and i don't think student should find a career at a young age it would be hard for them to find one.

I have to disagree of student finding a career at a young age because if student do find a career at a young age then they won't be forcusing in school work they mind will be them having that career by now and will brag about it to there friends and teacher no one want to hear thats also, it may not be the right career for them they need time to think the right career they want to enjoy in life.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5
BC0B186645A9,"Living on this planet, everyone has there own character traits. But does everyone create their own characteristic traits or are they influenced by those they surround their self's with.? John Lubbock, a British naturalist and politician wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I take a position on representing that you are in control choosing and creating your own character.

In building your own character it's all in your mindset. Mindset takes a big part in someones character because it shows what kind of person you are and how you represent your self and how you portray things in life. The way you think has an effect on you as a person and how you betray things in life. It also takes part in who you surround yourself with. Do you surround yourself with people who have goals in their life or inspire you to become a better you.?

It also takes part on things you choose to do and say on a daily bases. The decision you make could lead into something better or for the worse in current situations or in the long run.

Having motivation and a goal in the your life builds you as a person and sets you for growth. When you see someone in your life not doing well and not in a good current situation you want to avoid being in that position. But when you start seeing someone in your life doing better things and living the life that you want to accomplish, it's on your part to doubt yourself or make that you motivation. When you strive for something in life and start working hard for it, your mentality starts to change to do better and get to your goal.

Some may argue that the people you surround your self with is beyond your control on how your character traits are formed. Yes the people you surround yourself with everyday might have an effect on your characteristics, but it isn't beyond your control. You can have something to motivate you to be better then who you surround your self with. You have control over your thoughts and how you see things in life. It take's part on you and what you strive for in life.

In conclusion, Your own character traits are somethings that come within you and how you portray life. Your character traits are't something that is beyond your control but is something that you can control with motivation and a goal to strive for and it all comes from a strong mindet.

BC1F1C37721E,"Is it possible to impress someone at first time? Based on my experience I am extremely agree with this statement. It's possible to impress someone based on what we are, what we are doing, and what we want from them to do, because now days which everyone is fully educated and knows what is wrong or right, believes on their own. We can impress people towards our religion, towards our government party, and towards out country to visit.

We can impress people towards our religion by giving them the ideas of what is it about. How it will change up your future, how it will impact on your kids, how to treat with others, and also the idea of understanding someone better. Take them with us to the place where we practice our own religion, tell them the truth and advantages of it, and also show the religious cultures.

We could impress people towards our government parties to support us by voting us. Promise them that we would not let them down, we will accept their wants and help them to advice it, we will make their education department strong that everyone can get education, and we will make sure that we provide them their dream jobs after they graduate college.

We might impress someone to visit our country by telling them about the situation of our country, and tell them how cheap the things are. Show them the beautiful places, historical temples, culture, different kinds of foods, clothing, also about the rights of people.

To conclude, impression is something that people do for others to get their attention for a specific thing, such as impressing people to convert to their religion, motivating people to vote for a specific government and choose a good leader for their country, and also impressing people towards their countries situation to persuade them to visit their country.

BCF16DEB277E,"Many people can set a good example by the way the behave but you can also Influence people by the your professional career you have. I believe example is not the main thing it is the only thing because younger people growing up look up to you by the way your behavior is and they hear the kind of language you use towards friends and adults.

For example, when I was growing up I looked up to my brother I watched his actions very closely. One day I saw my brother giving food to poor people at 7 eleven and I was shocked, the next day I went to give food at 7 eleven. Eventually, as I was leaving the store the manager called me up and asked me why I was giving food out and I told him that I saw my brother giving so I thought that was the right thing to do. In another occasion my brother and mom went to the toy store to buy some toys for a birthday present for my cousin and my brother really wanted this toy so and my mom said that she was not going to buy for him so he started kicking the floor because he was mad at my mom and because of that my mom bought him the toy. So the next day my mom took me to the supermarket with her and I really wanted this snack from the shelf and she said that I could not buy it so I started kicking the floor and crying therefore my mom bought me the snack. Since I saw my brothers actions and behavior towards my mom and saw it worked out well I did the same thing.

For instance, one day I heard my mom arguing with my dad on the phone because of some misunderstanding they had and my mom was using foul language to address her part of the side and my dad was using it too. So later on in the day my mom called me on the phone and told me to go get my little brother at school and I told her it was not my problem to get him and then I started using foul language on the phone because I thought it was okay because she used on my dad. In another occasion I heard my brother giving out compliments to people on the street and by the way he spoke it influenced me to say the same thing as him as walked the streets.

Some people may argue that people get better influenced by a person of its professional career because they think they got to the place there at right now by showing they can go anywhere no matter what example they show.

In conclusion I believe that example is the one and only thing that influences others becasue what your actions do your younger sibling and friends are going to follow it and get influenced by you. the actions my brother took I followed them if though they were good or bad I got influenced by it. Also the way my mother was speaking and the language she was using towards my dad influenced me to speak back to her that way when she called me.          ",4.5,3.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,3.5
BDA991AF3ABE,"Thomas Jefferson once wrote ""determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I strongly agree with this quote for many reasons. If you're not doing something to help you get better, you'er failing, doing something for a purpose makes you succeed in life, and inactivity does not serve a purpose to this quote. Although, others may think different and disagree with this quote, other people in this world needs this motivation.

If you're not doing something to help you get better, you're failing. This role plays a huge part of others because failing is not a choice. You may fail a couple of times on this and that but what are you doing to not fail again? If something isn't right and want to fix it, do something about it.

In the other hand, doing something for a purpose makes you succeed in life. I play baseball for 10 years now and my goal is to make it to the big leagues but with this being my goal, I have to do something to help me achieve my goal. Success is not giving to you, you have to earn that success and by that, do something to help you succeed your dream.

At the end, inactivity does not serve a role in this act. Inactivity is getting in the way of you not achieving and succeeding. I take inactivity as a negative act because I dont want to be sitting at home or anywhere not doing something to help me get better. Be the one who changes your life by doing what it takes to do something in life to reach your highest goals.

Let this quote be a inspiration of achieving and succeeding in life or at anything. Be the one that can make a change. Doing something makes you accomplish more.

BDAE1D4B6C20,"The quote, '' hard work pays,'' means a lot when it comes to doing something and one staying idle. The world today upgrades itself each and everyday,which tells us that we should always be doing new everyday as humans.

Although some people say that been idle is the best way to go because it relaxes the body and gives it a new form of strength actually doing something always not only exposes one to new ideas and strategies but also makes the human body active and vibrant at all times. There are a lot of chances one can benefit from been productive other than been idle.

To start with, there are a lot of goodness in been productive than been an idle man. People who invest in their time to produce something meaningful are known across the globe because of their hard work and dedication. Due to how hardworking they are, they get the chance to explore new ways of doing things and new ideas that would help them in their next exploitation. For instance, since Bill Gates is hardworking man, he is known across the globe and due to this he has been exposed to other new things that would help him in whatever he is doing now. Again, when there is a football match between two different teams, and if one team is seen practicing so hard than the other, it would be considered that the team seen practicing the most would deliver more than the other team with no doubt.

Moreover, doing something always makes an individual active and lives longer than been idle. A person who is seen to be doing something productive all the time is considered to be adding more years to his or her age due to the fact that working tirelessly everyday helps keep the body in form and shape which by so doing prevents diseases that attack people. For instance when a person walks about a half and a mile to work everyday, it is very difficult to see that individual get sick because the body is always busy looking for something to do. On the other hand, idleness brings nothing but retrogression and failure because you're not able to bring forth anything productive and therefore it becomes a waste of time,energy and resources. One can make the comparison so easily between a productive person and someone been idle, a productive person can always be seen advancing from one stage to the other while an idle person will be seen at the space that he is at always.

Furthermore, when people say '' time is money,'' they are definitely talking about how one is able to use his available to produce something meaningful for himself to get money and have some other benefits as well. No one gets rich by just sitting at home, folding his hands and just expect something to happen. People may argue on this that one can make it in life when he or she inherits the possession from his family. This may be true because you may have everything to yourself but everything will be squandered if one does not work hard to top it up or add more to what he has. People choose idleness because it is more relaxing and the easiest way to go because you just sit there and wait for whatever happens to happen. Been idle can also affect a person in way or the other. In the sense that, if a person is seen to be at one place all the time, it may be considered that the person may be lazy and this may deprive him off certain opportunities that might help him in one way or the other.

Last but not least, working hard or been productive gets one a recognition or a specific type of award that goes a long way in life. There is no doubt about the fact that people who work hard are awarded the most and are the ones that are shown to the world for others to see and emulate their footsteps. For instance, Usain Bolt has been winning almost all his race in the Olympics and it sends a good message about him to the world because of how hardworking he is. Due to this someone else can decide to emulate his footsteps to become a world star like him.

Again no one chooses to be last in whatever he is doing but rather aims at the high spot. Although some people say that been idle is the best way to go because it relaxes the body and gives it a new form of strength actually doing something always not only exposes one to new ideas and strategies but also makes the human body active and vibrant at all times.

It always good to look at the brighter side of good and it is always advisable to go for what is right. Productivity brings a lot of good things in a person's life than any other thing a person can think of while Idleness brings nothing but retrogression in one's life.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5

I get that people use technology because of their jobs, but for other people is a distraction. I'm not saying it's a bad to have technology, what i'm saying is that now people don't hangout like they used to, they don't go shopping anymore now, they only want to be at home this is why, I considered a negative effect to people's lives.

Now almost teenagers, don't hangout with their friends anymore because they just can face time or call them without going out of their house. If they do hangout they are only on their cellular devices and not socializing; that's mean to the person that they are hanging out. They are only worried about their social media for example, they only see how many likes, comments and followers they get. Also, about what people say about them in social media and if they get tag in a picture. This is how people is now, they don't see the importance of talking to each other, they only want to know about what people say about them in social media.

People now does not want to go shopping stores anymore, which this means that stores are closing because of people buying everything online. So buying everything on online is the new thing on technology, therefore people now doesn't need to go out to buy what they need, now people just can order it that's why, they are being more lazy. For example, if they want pizza they just order it online or they saw a cute dress, but they didn't wanted to go to the store and buy it, they just order it online. And they get it to their house, so they don't go all the way there.

In this generation, almost everyone stays at home because they just want to be alone watching Netflix or being in their cellular device. Back then, people always went outside and play with their friends in the streets. It was fun to play with other people, people enjoyed it. Sometimes they even got the chance to meet more people. Now, if they want to be play with other people, they just download a game on their cell phones, computer or even on social media; now they have games too. Also, people used to go watch a movie or hangout at least, but now people stay at home because they can see the movies or playing videogames with other people online.

BE4764F7BFF1,"The Downside of Online Classes

A couple of schools offer online classes through virtual videos and video conferencing for students to take from home. Some schools might think that students would benefit from this and others think that this is not a good idea. From my perspective, students would not benefit from taking online classes for many reasons such as; they could get distracted easily, they miss out interacting with teachers and students, and they would eventually get bored of online school at home.

To begin with, many students K though 12th grade get distracted easily. The distraction is not because we don't want to do the work, but it's our minds. Everyone's minds work in a different way and theres always going to be that part of us that gets distracted by the small things around us. Also, technology is somewhat of an issue because it distracts many people because of the games and many apps that it has. Students could go off task and go off playing games or watching videos while they are supposed to be learning and doing their work online. For example, sometimes even I get distracted while doing my work at home through my computer or smart device because of the many other things I could be doing instead of doing homework. There are many distractions online and around us that could make us go off task instead of keeping us focused to do our work.

Furthermore, many students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff. In other words, when you are taking online classes the only person there with you would be your teacher, whom is communicating with you through your computer. No one else would be there with you to help you through it, everything would have to be on your own. Ultimately, if you are in a school many teachers and students would be there to assist you with any questions or concerns that you might have. Also, you would miss out on a lot more exciting events such as school dances,

football games, and pep rallies. There is so much that you would miss out if you wouldn't go to a public school and decided to take online school instead.

Ultimately, you would also be spending almost all day in your house because of online classes. A regular school day is about 8 hours, meaning the online classes would be about the same time , or more or less. In school 8 hours is already tiring enough because of the learning and listening, but think of 8 hours at home with no breaks in between, that would be extremely exhausting. Almost all students that attend school come for a full 8 hour day, which includes break in between classes, then once school is over they go back home to be able to relax. If you are at home for 8 hours doing work, you wouldn't want to spend time relaxing at your home because eventually it would get boring there after a while. In my experience being at home gets boring to the point where I don't know what else to do to not be bored at home. In other words, being in the same place for a whole day would get boring and uncomfortable.

On the other hand, other schools claim that it is a good idea for students to take online classes. They are in favor of taking online classes through video conferencing. Some of the schools think that online classes are a good idea because many students could possibly avoid drama, get 1 on 1 assistance, and learn quicker. Although some of it is true, online classes should not be necessary. Online school should only be necessary if a student does not feel safe at their school because of personal reasons.

Overall, online classes are not a good idea at all unless it is necessary because of safety issues. Besides that, it would not be a good idea because many students would get distracted when they are supposed to be doing work, students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff, and they would spend most of their day at home which is unhealthy.",5.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5
BE6A28051A30,"In my opinion, i completely agree with this association church statement. Success consists of going from failure to failure until you get what you're being fighting for, without losing your enthusiasm. However i realized that the time period it's not the same to the one that we're living on. Company Association, Churches, and Governments are not alike as before, because now if you are trying to achieve something and for some reason you failed, people will start judge on your acts that you're not capable to become your dreams reals. Eventhough failure plays an important role in the pursuit of success. I would like to share one specific example that fail is the promotion that brings you to success.

I would like to lasso the example of your first day on your new job. We all passed through that situation , you feel like you're not lace in, in the directions that your boss or supervisor gave it to you to do and thanks to that some employees start laugh at you, about your failure and no one is loyal to come up to you and teaches you how to do it they stand by and wait until they see that you made it wrong then they try to help you. But, let me tell you something that you already know, the world isn't a rainbow it's a very mean and nasty place and it doesn't matter how rude you are, it would put you into your knees and keep it permanently if you let it. Not you, not me, even no one hits that hard like life does. But, it does't care how it hits, the only thing that really cares is about how much you can take, how much you can get hit and keep moving forward. If you know what you worth, then go out and get what you worth, but you must have to be able to hold out hits and not to came and blame others and say; I can't be the person that i want to be, because of him or her, or anybody.

BF5E7CD37E4B,""" Imagination is more important than knowledge ""

Can imagination be more important than knowledge?

I think that imagination can be more important than knowledge. Due to the imagination of some scientists have created a massive number of inventions that benefit almost all the people of the world in that part is when knowledge is created based in imagination. In movies of sci-fi the director imagine a space full of flying cars and gas stations in the space, one great example was in the movie ""Return to the future 2"" the director and the writer of the movie imagine a skateboard that could elevate one ore two inches from the floor and they put it in the movie, and now scientist invented a skateboard that can elevate four centimeters from the floor.

First of all, whiteout imagination the world couldn't be the same like we know it right know,the imagination can help to improve your knowledge. Think about that a world whit geometrical forms like squares or rectangles, horrible! For example: Bill gates was a normal person, studying in a normal university, and whit a normal family. But one day he imagine how to improve his knowledge of school of the systems of computers, then he invented windows, so thats is a great example o how imagination can change the world.

Also, the imagination can help people work. You use it in projects, you use it in homework, also you use it in tests (Like me right now). For example: I was in a project of a debate of countries, my team was N.Korea, i needed to imagine if i where in Generic_City presenting my statement to all affiliated countries of UN, so i began to write, i though i was going to lose, because my enemy was the Westerns powers, but then we could win due i could imagine if the situation was like i where a person of N.Korea speaking to orders governments.

Third, imagination makes you feel better, when you are bored or when you are sad, the imagination always can make you appear a smile in your face. For example: i meet a partner that was depressed, i tell him ""i know how you are going to be happy, imagine you and the people you love to be near are in a vacation, then imagine you are whit out problems, whit out school, whit out homework,etc. Now i think now you are willing to be without stress or difficulties in these day"", he told me he was better.

Finally, I think and many people does is that whit out imagination we couldn live happy and whit a lot of fun, knowledge is a part of the bast world of imagination. People famous and normal people are successful by the imagination they use in theres life.",3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0

BF72FB4B953F,"Three year graduation

Is it beneficial for students to graduate a year earlier then the rest or could graduating earlier impact a student's health? Many high schools allow students to choose between graduating in three years or the traditional four years. Some students accept this offer with the idea of leaving early and not dealing with drama. In my opinion early graduation is not worth the mental, physical, and emotional stress.

To start off, when you choose to graduate within three years you are choosing to work during summer and do all core classes for junior and senior year in one semester. you worry so much whether you are going to pass or not here is where stress applies. Generic_Name, a college student at John Tyler community college, was suppose to have graduated last year skipping her fourth year but, unfortunately she couldn't keep up with everything. She had to do all her junior classes in one semester and her senior classes during second semester causing her to stress and have a mental breakdown in the middle of her Biology class. After consulting with her guidance counselor she came to the conclusion that she will have to do her fourth year of high school for her mental health's sake.

Now with that being said, transitioning from junior to senior year is hectic. You have to make sure you have enough credits to continue: make sure you keep up with all your classes and their requirements: and you have to stay up late studying and doing homework. A young adult needs at least 8 to 7 hours of sleep to properly function through out the day. A student that stays up doing late night homework and studying do not obtain most of those hours leaving them with only 2 to 3 hours to sleep;therefore causing them to be tired all day long the next day. The lack of sleep has a big impact on a student who wants to graduate early, for they fall asleep in class and miss out on important notes.

In addition, the simple attempt to graduate is emotionally stressful. Now imagine only having one year to do both junior and senior classes. Once again you worry about passing but this time you question yourself. You ask yourself "" Am I capable of making it? and Am I smart enough?"" and dwell on these questions. Eventually you start putting yourself down and start thinking whether you made the right choice or not. This is where your emotions come in to play. Meanwhile you are trying your hardest to do all your work you start feeling angry at yourself because you simply can not keep up. Soon enough you give up on everything your education and most importantly your future.

On the contrast, for many high school students graduation is an exit ticket. The faster we manage to graduate the better. We no longer have to wake up early in the mornings, we do not have to interact with students and their negative attitudes, and we no longer have to be caught up in high school drama. but even though graduating early seems glorious it is not worth all the emotional, mental, and physical stress of doing both years in one semester.

In conclusion, three year graduation is more than just saying "" let's do it!"". It takes away from your sleeping schedule; stressing you out when you fall asleep in class and fail to copy notes. Causes you to worry so much whether you are going to pass or not and mentally stress. you eventually start to question yourself, feel insecure and emotionally stressed. Graduating early seems glorious but once again it is not worth all the stress.                   ",4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0

However, some people might argue with that, because they think that people should not make their own decisions but they should seek guidance from experts to make a better decisions for them.

First, everyone should depends on himself and make a better decisions in life to get more experience for example a student can't get a good grade unless he makes a decisions to pay attention to the teacher and doing the homework.

Second, people are not going to learn unless they make their own decisions for example nobody will be by your side all the time and in the hard situations to help you make a good decision and a person should not just think once but twice and think far and know what are the consequences of every decision.

Third, one decision can change everybody life and that is on of the reasons why people should depend on them self because nobody cares about you more than you. Other reason is most of the successful people they started from nothing but they made a good decisions and they became successful.

They will never be satisfied, they will judge you, they will talk bad things about you, but at the end it's just a obstacle that the life put in your way, so you can surpass it and finally find yourself and be how you are.

To be yourself in this actual world it's difficult for some people because sometimes they don't support the judges from other people and most of this people just decide to end with their life. For example the LGBT community get a lot of hate, judge and bad things from other people that is not part of it. People in this world just talk about others without thinking the pain that they can cause by saying just a few simple words. Other example is the people from other country that travel to another, there are people that are racist and make people feel that they are from another world, when they are actually they same, the only thing that change is the culture and language.

To be yourself in a world that is contantly trying to make you something else is one of the most important things that people have to achieve, to live the life better because you will never progress in your emotional life if you don't make people accept the way that you are.

For teenagers to be theirselves is most difficult because they are in a young age and sometimes they don't really know how they are or how they want to be, and when they finally find it, the hard part is coming. Then for older people, most of them don't care what people say about them, I have seen a lot of older people that dress and make to their selves what they want and I really like to see them because it makes me to be less insecure about myself, they just make me think a lot.

Live the life by showing how you are, the opinion of other people doesn't have to make you more insecure or make you think that if you do this or other things you will get judged or hated. You have to fight to achieve this because life is better if you do it, is better if you don't care about others comments, you will be more stronger than before if you fight with all this situations.

You will be more happy and will have a great life if you are yourself, you will be more certain about your opinions, decisions and actions. You can help other people to achieve this goal that is ""To be yourself"" because sometimes there is people that need from others to make a change in their life.

If you help them and they accept your help, they will be thankful to you because you help them a lot and you was with them, when nobody wasn't.

At the end of your days you will be really thankful to you because you live life the way that you are, not the way that others wanted you to be. You will think in all the things that you have to supported and achieved just to get your goal, to be who you are and at end you will knew that it wasn't hard.

C02F3803D0D1,"People think that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree with that because impressions is just what you think, always make you think different things, and you never know whats gonna happen.

Impressions is like when you thought somethings, its just what you think about someone or something. For example:My impression is that she is not telling me the truth. you think that she's not telling you the truth but you don't know the truth.

Impressions can make you think different or bad just because how you look at someone or something. For example: If you see someone that has a bad looking, your impression is that he might be poor but, you can change your impression if you see that he has the Iphone of the year, or he has a Lamborghini, so it can make you think different.

When women get pregnant they always get impress and trying to guess what the baby is gonna be. For example: When my mom got pregnant and she had me, her impression was that it was gonna be a girl, and she wanted a girl, but here i am, 18 years old, a big boy and she was impress and sad, but when she see that i was very handsome her impression change she's happy now.

Some people believe that just with their impression you are what they say.

Next time you think that the first impression is impossible to change, you have to think the first impression does not say everything about a person or something.

Seeking muitipule opinions is a better choice beacsue you can get a bunch of diffferent opinions and they most likey will have a better point of view. Its better to have mutilple choice then just having one choice or opinions now for some examples Example one If a student is having issuse at home they have mutiple opinions which are 1. talk to a counsler 2. talk to the school social worker 3. talk to a trusted adult 4. talk to a friends parent 5. talk to other family members..

example two a lady haves a few job offers but he goes for one and thinks he not going to pass the interview but he stll has a few jobs lining up behind him the job offers are1. sceintest at nasa 2. host on the ellen show 3. a buisness owner.

I also feel like asking one person would not be the best choice bescause what if they dont have have the best opinions or best advice,i feel like for the bst advice ask more then one person make sure the person is trustable make sure the person knows what they are talking about.

Main reason why I would like to accomplish being decisive, is because it effects the way I think, for example; ''What if I'm writing this essay, and I include some other thing that doesn't have to do anything with the prompt I'm meant to be writing about?"" Then, I erase everything and start again, I sit for more then 20 minutes and end up with the worst decision. I would like to accomplish being able to choose my best decisions fast enough, that I dont have to worry about it.

I been working on this for a long time time now, and it's not easy, I ask myself if it's this possible. Being able to decide for myself is important to me because I wont have to be asking people around me such as parents, teachers, or classmates to tell me if anything I do is good enough, and I'm always asking for opinions, ending up regretting for what i chose,

In the classroom is hard to concentrate on the assignments and tests because I will have tons of questions going around my head, when ever i can't decide for myself I end up dis concentrating and start to think about lots of different things.

The older student that is assisting the younger student could make him smarter. What i mean by this is that the older student will help the student on math, language arts, and science which the older student already took. The older kid already knows the concepts of the subjects that the younger student is taking, which means he will teach him the concepts. This means that the younger student would already know the concepts of the three subjects that the older student taught him which is science, language arts, and math.

The older student can teach other subjects like physical science, and civics economics which the young student could be ready for.

Also some students have to work after school, this meas if they stay at the school more time, it will less time that they will have to make work's hours, but this dosen't affect them to much, because they will attend to the school only four day in a week. This is graet because they will have a long weeked to make their tasks and work and help their parents at home with the home's jod.

These summer projects should be student-designed for varies reasons such as, engagment, vaction, and lastly, confidence.

Students during the summer have many things to worry about like having a job, looking after siblings or even their mental health and the last thing on their mind is a techer-designed project. The projects given throughout the summer should be student-designed becuase it allows the student to be engaged. The student will be more engaged because it is a topic that they want to learn about and being engaged shows that the student is willing to learn and is very intrested in his or her own topic. Typically, when a teacher assigns a project to a student, the student isn't very pleased and with that being said, it could affect the amount of effort and the desire that the students puts into actually learning.

Secondly, these projects also need to be student-designed because of summer experiences. During the summer, alot of students grow. Vaction plays a big role in the students growth and development, as the students travel they pick up more and more knowledge, which expands their knowldege and could possibly change thier perception of things, making it easier for them to have better ideas and to do well on their summer projects.

Lastly, student-designed projects over break leads to confidence. Because the student has had the freedom of choosing what he or she wants to learn about, it just makes it easier for the students to showcase their work with pride. Pride meaning, showing that the student has learned and is more than comfortable to enlighten others. To have confidence about what you have put alot of time into and worked on is an important skill to develop because the student will surely use it some other time in their lifetime.

In conclusion, these summer projects should be student-designed because it will surely keep the student engaged in his or her own learning and add a little more excitement to the students vacation because the project is something they are eager to learn and work on.

C4CFCB3B7F13,"Dear principal today i would like to write about the plans that the school have with lunch food, I have hear form many students about the school food lunch chaging many students are disapointed and others aere happy for the news, My self personally I have my on opinion that I would love to share with you about this topic.

In my opinion I think it would be great for the health of the school and student to have a healthy food during school hours, one main reason is bacause it keep our body,healthy strong in which we can reflex our education, It will benefit all the students mainly the ones that are in PE class,eating healthy can improves more day of life and better human body, eathing halthy can prevent you from disease and probably some virus.

by eathing healthy you will not only will be able to be on a good fit you can also feel good and with feeling good about your self means more thant anything in this world, my opinion about this i agree with this change and i would like to see more plans for the upcoming futre years.

every plas have good and bad opinions many student at school have said and have their own opinion, Many of them dont like to eat halthy they just wnat to eat and enjoy their life at the fullest, which is reasenable and i undestand they point, we all know that the food that make our body get fat and get worse is the bad type food but we all love that kind of food, is delicius and it taste great for example pizza, hamburgers and all those kidn of food.

To keep a balance and for the students to be better and feel better about them self i think it will be the best to have a schedule of food for example :monday healthy food, Tuesday bad food...

In my opinon i thik it will be the best for our students and for everyone in the school to have a healthy food schedule that way we can be happy and satisfy with our body. I agree with the plan of replacing the school food for a healthy kind of food. thanks for all your pation and i hope you like my opinions and you could consider this on your future plans.",2.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,3.0

also i think they should put each class an hour like example math should be an hour also Science , English , geography because all we honestly do need is come to school get our education then go home we dont need all stuff they put like electives they just make the day more longer and waste of our time honestly thats my opinion and how i see it.

they should only put the one hour in for the kids that need help or catch up with there missing work and that will help more for them because it would benefit them more but after all the day i think they shouldn't put that extra hour but like i said only if kids need help they should put the extra hour in.

after all they shouldn't make it an hour because its really not worth it if we already have a long day of school they should just take electives away so school can go more faster and just get it over it also just get our education faster.        ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0

Work in group also have benefit to, is more easy and more fast because all student do one part of the work, another benefit is if a student don't undertand the work the other student can help to explain, in this form all students understand the work, the mayority of the students prefer to work in group because is more easy and sometimes a student don't work and all the rest of the group do all the work.

But in my opinion I prefer to work alone because I learn more and understand more about any type for example if work alone I need to do all the work and I need to found all the information and do all the examples and explain all about my work, the most important about this two type is learn to working in group and workin alone because sometimes in the future all will work in group or alone,

in both form is good to work and always do the best and each work.

Both have benefits but I think that the best option is to work alone also because is better for the student start to work alone, for the teachers the best option is the same, the students work alone because in this form they can learn more about the student in how they work and how they think, the teachers can see the capacity of each student because not all the students work the same in this process help to all the teachers learn more about all students.",3.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5

C70AEFA3CD16,"I am agree with the Emerson's statement, be yourself in a place where everyone else want you to be something else is a greatest accomplishment, because be who you are is really hard, more when people is trying to make you do things that you do not like or want, and ignore that kind of persons is a hard achievement. The differences in the people is what make us specials, because every vary has their own thing that they are good a it and they like to do it. And be in a place where is hard to be yourself is not easily to support it, and it is complicate it. Be who you are in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. Because stay in a place where no one let you be yourself is really difficult, desperate, and sadly.

Is difficult be yourself in a place where no body accept you by how you are, the immigrant know how that feels, because they came from a different country where they have different culture and believes. Mexicans immigrant is hard to be their self in USA, because the culture and language is different than the Mexican people specially the language, learn a new languages is hard and when Mexicans do not learn the language yet they feel like they are not accepted, because no one can understand them. The difficulty of be in an immigrant is that you have to learn the culture, and language of the country but you do not have to stop being yourself. Because I know that be in a different country is hard to be yourself.

it is desperate when people try to make you something else, most of teen anger got desperate when their parent try to make them something that they dont like. Teen angers just want to be their self and do things that they like. Because when parents, family or other people try to make you something different of what you were thinking is really stressful. Sometimes people try to make you something else, because they think that is going to be good for you but they dont think if is going to like or if you are good at it they just want you to do what they think is better for you but parents forget your opinion. Is desperate too when you doing something different than others and they tell you that you are wrong.

Being in a place where no body want you for being different of what they want is sadly, because people do not accept you for how or who you are, and persons that are different are mostly alone. A student that is immigrant could understand this because when a student that is immigrant go to a new school from other country have to learn a new language, and some other students that are from that country dont accept the immigrants just for be them self. And I think that is but people should accept other persons that are from other countries and let them be their self. In that way people can learn many new think that can be interesting, and everyone is going to be happy, but when people do not accept other people and dont let them be is sad, cause they are alone.

I am agree be yourself in world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the grates accomplishment, because being alone in a place where no one accept you for who you are is very difficult to live, is desperate hear things that you dont wanna do and people still try to tell you what to do to make you something else, and sadly when no one want you just for be different and you have to be alone. In conclusion be yourself and do not give up is the biggest achievement. Always is going to be hard to be who you are but never give up. ",3.0,2.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0
C76DBCE18AF0,"Many people think that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I agree with this statement, because first impressions is something that is hard to change in your life. And when someone tries to change their first impressions they always fail. First impressions are the reasons why people don't get along because they think different about each other.

In my experience on first impressions are always bad, because when I'm going to talk to someone and the first thing I do before talking to them is judge them in good way. For example, if I'm going to a new school and I go my first day of classes, and I don't know no one in that school, and I want to talk to someone or be friends with someone, I'm going to have to talk to people in the new school, and before I talk to them I always think if they are good people or bad people. And if think that someone is bad, but in reality she/he is a really nice person. That is an example of first impressions.

I think that if you're trying to change your first impressions is going to be difficult, because you can't change something that is going to happen before you meet someone new. First impressions is something that every human has in their lives and they can't change it, because is a part of their lives. Even the animals have first impressions, because when you are trying to buy a dog, the dog is going to have a first impression because the dog is getting an owner.

C77A361A7476,"Is it good for students to to finish high school early?. Students should be allowed to take classes early because they do all their work in time , they take classes over the summer or even after school. They also get to go to college faster. They also get to walk and get there diploma faster. The student get's to go to college to study for what he wanted to study for.

The students who study harder or finish the work they do should be allowed to finish school in three years. If they study hard and take extra classes let them fish early. That's all up to them , if they care about their study let them walk early. The student put's his or her mind set to finish school early witch is great for them. The student who finishes school gets more time off of school. But at the same time more stress on them.

At the end of the day the more students that finish school early have one full year of no school. They get to focus on what they wanna go to college for to study. But that's only some schools, some schools don't even allow students to finish school in three years. In some schools they make you do the full 4 years of high school. Some schools probley want the students to do the the full 4 years of high school because they probley need a class on 12th grade.

If some schools let some students finish in the 3 years then the school wont be as packed. The schools need more space cause of more students coming in. They need to have more space and it would be less work for them. But at the same time it would take some time off the teachers. Some teachers have the time to help students and some don't.

Welp that's all have to say about schools letting students finish school in three years. I really think schools should let students finish early because they work hard to get there.

If the student finishes his or her work they should be allowed to walk early. I think that all schools should allow all the students who want to finish early to let them.

C85DA87E87CC,"Dear Teacher,

I've been asked if is more beneficial working in a group with students or working alone. In my opinion I think working as a group is more beneficial than doing all the work alone. I think working as a group is less stress on the student but helps get the work done faster and easier. I've noticed that people do better in group projects because the work can be split between the students and not just one person doing all the work that may be hard to understand or do all the work on time. Working as a groups helps mostly those students who really don't do their work on time or having problems in understanding what to do and also they can ask the students in the group for more support or in explaining something more clear.

For example, if a student that is working alone doesn't understand the concept of the project and has no one to ask or just doesn't want to ask the teacher they will either do it wrong or just not do it because they don't have that extra support. In a group you usually have that person that is on top of you if you are doing you part and asking if you need help or need more explaination. Being a group creates communication skill and helps those who have trouble with interacting with other students. Working as a group get the work done faster and helps not go to hard on youself. This is why when a teacher asks me if I want to work alone or with a group or partner, I always work with someone else becasue it just helps me get my assighnment done on time because I have done big projects by myself and I see that I struggle do it , then at the end I get a bad grade or I just end up not doing it because I feel like I can ask th teacher for help. Some students have this problem in reaching out to their teacher because they are either shy or they just can't find a way to get their help.

Many students will agree that working as a group is helpful and beneficial instead of working alone where is hard to do everything alone and having to plan what to do to get an assignment done and hoping for the best. ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
C868C220A380,"I disagree,and here on my reasons. If you just believe on your imagination then knowledge it wouldnt end up go for you. 1,people would think your crazy. 2,people would not even believe it would even work or would ever come true. Lastly,people would just think its plain old dumb if you believe in that.

I think people would think your crazy because if you keep living on your imagination then you'll get to stcuk in your own little games your in,and you'll sometimes forget what the real world thinks of you. The worst to come is that you'll get to scared to come to even go out into the real world. Knowledge is a powerful thing that everyone has,and its more powerful than your own imagination. If yo keeping thinking about your own little world your own little world you live in,then you would just forget on how the real world is a scary place.

Second of all,If you have a big imagination,people would not even believe that it would ever come true. Reson number 1,people would just believe in whatever you do. Think about it,their are so many ideas that just shut down,like how bills get made but they dont even get to the second step of becoming a law. Reason number 2,Everyone judges on what you think and what you believe. Some might agree,but most of all they just think your werid or crazy. So yes, it's scary to think on what people believe in what you imagine.

Finally,People would just think your plain on dumb. If your imagination gets to out od hand,people would just think your dumb or disagree with you. Yes,it's werid or even sad to have people judge or think your done with your own fantasy. People won't take you seriosly. And if they don't take you like you mean business,then they just won't talk to you at all. And your left with nothing but your own ideas. So,its risky to have a really big imagination because people would just think your plain on dumb or they might take your ideas and leave you with nothing.

In conculsion,I don't think it would be a great idea to have a big imagination. Knowledge is best because people won't judge you,they wont think your crazy,and they would believe you a 100%. I think its great having a big imagination,but dont get to attach to your imagination.",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
C8EBB096262B,"To Begin with, many student have many excuses to not attend school. Of curse, that we can change this to not be happen anymore. Student may not complete the school if they lose the year.

What would happen if student get affected for all student that not attend school? For example, like I seen in me that I have a lot of appointment that is affecting me and my grade. We can not let this happen we need to do many thing in order to not let our child lose. In addition,

principal should offer distance learning for student that the way could not affect them because student might have a natural disaster in their neighborhood, student might be sick in such manner that could not attend school, that might affect their grade and they might repeat the year.

First reason, student might be absent for a reason like to be sick in such manner that could not attend school. All included student that is special that they go for a week or more in the hospital. Moreover, student sometime the doctor let a lot of appointment for them to check up or appointment with the dentist. Also, student who have allergies when the weather change they got affect in that they may not come to school. In high school, student sometime they get pregnant and the doctor let them many appointment including when they delivery they lose many school days and that affect many student lose the year or they may get affect their grade. Because we don't know in the future what will happen to some of our student that many of them don't find any solution of their problem. In fact, we don't know what it will happen if we don't give an opportunity to our students. We must pay attention to them if they lose many days of school sometime they are afraid to talk about their problem.

Second reason, student in their neighborhood might have a natural disaster also might need the distance learning in order to not lose school days. Sometime the weather get so angry that may bring accident or can bring tree crashing in our hose or may get rain and rain that could bring floating that may cause a lot of problem to some our students. In addition, the school bus may not get as in order to come to school. If it a student that walk that student could not get to school and the County could not cancel the school or even in there's no light and that may tell an announcement that student could not get informed about the school information weather. Because, if student get that problem the principal could not believe and it can not give an chance to those student to take the test or the exam that they had in class. After all, in the school no one care about you even if you have a teacher that it is so inpatient.

To end with, the school should offer the distance learning to some of our students. Student may got sick for a little reason and if they had natural disaster, we should care about it. If we find a student that always is absent we should ask them what is the matter or what is the problem with them? While some may argue that if we offer the distance learning student may not lose school days and even they could not lose their grade student could have benefit from this way student could not lose, however some may argue that if we gave the distance learning to student student could not enjoy this learning they just will playing even if we give the distance learning in computer they just see it they they will start playing video game or they just will watch a video.

C8EF7048C03F,"When you're looking for advice, you might not go to the same exact person. Hopefully you do talk to more than one person to make a better choice and give up the less opportunity cost. Most people talk to more than one person to see their other options instead of putting all one decision into one person's own opinion.

One thing I like about talking to multiple people for advice is that they can give you so many open options to pick and decide from. Most likely if all the people you talk to about advice or help, you will pick what they have choose. Which can be good or it could lead to a bad cause. Your always gonna have a opportunity cost. You either make a good or a bad move, which can lead in different directions. including the rest of your life, your mood for the rest of the day, the improvement, or the impact. There are multiple options that can occur.

Another reason this option is good is because you can hear all the others people's opinion's about your choice and you can mark out the ones you have already happened to you in a perfect or an awful way. You can also, pick their opinions or options and learn from it either if it's gonna be a bad time or a good time. After you have learned you can help out the one's in your same position or a little more different. But still can be able to help others in need. You can learn from it and help other's or you can learn from it and help yourself in the future if you ever come upon the same situation. Or even teach the one's need in teaching

One dislike I don't like about talking to a couple of people for advice, is hearing their opinions and advice it could possibly change your mind of you were thinking about before, But also it could be the better choice of the 2 or more open options. Different people can give you different responses about your situation. Which can make your problem worse of the option your gonna have decide to pick which advice could outrun the rest. Even picking which choice your gonna make can put more stress and pressure on you. Maybe even after picking your choice it could turn out the worst day of your life or the best. It's really hard to make the selection of which advice your gonna pick.",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0

Although, Some people believe that the cell phones shouldn't be allow in classroom. Actually, I think that cell phone should be allow in classroom because it allow students to find information fast about what they need and they can write note on their cellphone that they can read at any time they want.

Some people that believe that cellphones shouldn't be allow in classroom have their reasons. They think that students that use their cell phone in classroom don't pay attention at what the teacher is teaching them and that could be something that might help them in the future and they think that it is really disrespectful for the teacher that the students use their cell phone during class while he is talking. Also they think that student might use their cell phone to cheat during a test.

Cellphone allow students to find any information fast about what they need for the class or group project. A school computer sometimes takes a several moment to log in. Waiting for the computer to log is really stressful because we might not have much in class and many students work after schools so they might not have time to finish it at home. Also help students that are new in this country and that do not know English. They can translate any word they don't know in English. This way students learn more English and faster.

The students can use their cell phone to write notes on their cell phone that they can read at any time they want because students are often using their cell phone. students might in their work, in their friend's house, walking home or any where else and they just need to take out their cell phone. Also students they can study for a test anywhere they go at any time they want to because they always have their cell phone with them.

In conclusion, the students should be allow to use their cellphone in classroom because it allow students to find information fast about what they need and they instead of using a computer or dictionary can write note on their cellphone that they can read at any time they want and wherever they go.

CBCA3CFF320B,"Boom!One day PROPER_NAME mom decided that she wanted him to join the distance learning classes.Where they could have online or video conferences with there school teachers.PROPER_NAME would sit around all day on his phone playing videos games instead of doing his online or video conferences.PROPER_NAME is like many others who thinks school is not all that important.I believe that schools should not offer distance learning to students.Therefore,students would not benefit from attending classes at home because students would have more free-time, students would be discourage that school is not important,Also they would skip classes to meet up with friends.

First,students would have free-time.For example,PROPER_NAME was home alone because her mom and dad works at a fast-food restaurant called LOCATION_NAME.PROPER_NAME knows she would have online conferences in the morning the next day at 8:30.Next morning came PROPER_NAME decided that she was not doing any conferences because she wanted to go shopping at the mall

for a up coming beach day that her aunt PROPER_NAME was having.PROPER_NAME then spend all day at the mall walking around looking in stores and talking to friends.Another example,There was a Vybz Kartel performance in LOCATION_NAME where they would give away free food and drinks at the gate. PROPER_NAME mom make sure to call home and remind her that she would have video conference in the afternoon with the teacher she loves the most PROPER_NAME but there was no answer so her mom decided to leave a voice mail ad hope when she sees the message she will know what to do. PROPER_NAME then left home after listing to her moms voice mail saying that she needs some alone time so she have to attend this party because all her friends were going and she wanted not to feel left out.Additional, PROPER_NAME boyfriend PROPER_NAME texted her saying he want to spend the day with her because he was leaving on October the 26,to go and stay for sum time in LOCATION_NAME with his dad. PROPER_NAME then got up pack a bag with clothe then left without anyone know she was out of the house without studying for her online conference presentation.c

Secondly,students would skip classes to meet up with friends.For example, PROPER_NAME skip distance learning classes to go enjoy the day with her best friend PROPER_NAME because it was his birthday and he invites her out for ice-cream and horse back riding. In addition, as for PROPER_NAME hanging out with his friends skiing in glove on snowboard or ice hockey is way cooler then staying home listening to his online conference teacher talk. Another example, PROPER_NAME dad PROPER_NAME just brought this new speedboat.one day when her dad was not at home she decided it is better not to do her online or video conference she was just going to invite sum of her friends over and they could take the boat for a spin at a hotel called HOTEL_NAME.They spent all day boating around instead of her doing her online classes.Another example, PROPER_NAME woke up one Monday morning saying she doesn't feel like she has a need to be taking distance learning classes so she pack her bag and call her friend PROPER_NAME to go with her to the countyside to look on lakes,mountain,and also valley.

Lastly,students would get discourage that school is not that important.For example, PROPER_NAME was taking AP biology class because she wanted to be a doctor, but because her mom start letting her taking online conferences for biology and start staying home she get discourage that school is not that important because if it was why would they would her to stay her.Next example, PROPER_NAME wanted to be a color guard coach but her aunt was telling her she does not have enough money to pay for her to attend the color guard practices her aunt heard about this distance learning program where she could stay home and learning about the skills for color guard for free. PROPER_NAME decided that if that could help she would take the class after two days PROPER_NAME said to her mom that the distance learning is not working out the way she wanted it to be also that is lower her expectation about school.Some people believe that if school offer distance learning to students it would allow them to have freedom.They are incorrect because most students are responsible.",2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0
CBEB284749D7,"I belive that Going beyond what you have already mastered is a great way to accomplish in life it will motivate you to work hard and take more steps as you are trying to achieve more goals. Some people believed that going beyond what you have already mastered is not a great way to accomplished becuase you will never grow and that will lead you to fall back and it is beneficial because you have already accomplished.

In my opinion going beyond what you have already mastered is a great way to achieved more goals and the more steps you take the more experience you will get than just focusing on what you have already mastered,because achieving more and taking risk in every journey that you made is a great way to know how important each step you take is and going beyond that will prove how strong and passionate you are to be more successful. For example if you are in a soccer team and your team had already won three goal that should not give you the risk to relax and think that you have already mastered what you were trying to get ,go beyond that and play more harder and get to were you want to be until you feel accomplished that will give you the courage to try to do more and never look down.

Another reason why people should try to do something beyond what they have already mastered is it will set an example to the public by showing how ethusiatic you are in any part that you take ,because you are aiming to get more and win more and you will be a role model to the young generation, For example if someone is trying to let go because they had already got what they want they will take you as a mentor, because you at the other side never stop even though you have already mastered and accomplished more but you are still aiming to get more and you are still growing.

Another reason to go beyond is it will impact you in your after life and you will also feel proud that you never let go you take risk you go beyond your thought, for eaxample you another person who have already mastered what they want and they feel good withwhat they have already get and you gop beyond that makes you a hero.

In conclusion you will always expect more and accomplished more if you are willing to go beyong your gains and what you have already get.",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0
CC149CD4B584,"In this paragraph I will write about how students can take classes from their homes and if they are going to do good in the works that the teachers give to the students on online, talk to the cousolers or tho his admistrator, the students will have some benefit, Students will have benefits with the grades.

If the student offer distance learning, First he must have to talk to his counsoler about doing classes online and disscus with her about he can stay home and do the classes online. Second, the students have to take test before they do the classes online because the teachers or another people from the school can see if he really is going to do the work at home and be prepaed for all the work that the teacher will give to him/students. Finally, the teachers will see and talk to his counsoler or administrator if they do good in the test and see if they can saty at home and do the classes online also the teacher should give a recomendation to the students if they have to take classes online.

The students will have some benefits if they take classes online, First, the students obiasly will have benefit because they will be doing all work at home and they can ask for help to his/her brothers or sister at home and they can help to do the work and if they have a test in the class that he is taking he will pass because he can see the notes or some works that he finished before. Second, They will have benefit because they are not going to school and he can go out during the day and also do the work when they're out. Finally, Students also will have benefit because they can do the work whenever they want bacuse if they have the classes online at the computers is more easier for example, if they only have to take notes they only can see another attachment of the same thing and if they have a test they will see the notes or another paper about the test.

Students will have benefits with the grades. Firts, the students will have good grades because they will have a lot of time do the work that is assigment for the next day or the same day and they will be concentrate because they are going to be alone at home. Second, The students will have a lot of benefit in that because they can see some work abouth the assigment and have a 100 points in the assigment or if they have a project that the students who are in the school they only will have a hour to do it because the others teacher will give a lot of homework to them but the student whp is taking classes online he will have a lot of work too bute he will have all the day to do it or the next day.

In conclusion they can't take classes online because they will have a lot of benefits that the students who is going to school and they can sleep a lot and the regular student has to wake up early and they can't have benefit with grades or other benefits,

In my opinoin students should not to take classes online because that is going to be more easy than the stduent who take classes at school becuase the students who is in the school they are not going to have he same benefits as the students who take classes online.",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

Second, technology is very important for some people because some need for job, communicates, homework, play online or other things. Third, some people uses the technology for good things like "" people can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person."" This explains the technology is good and promote more easy lives of the people. Also, the technology sometimes can had negatives effects on people's lives because some people do ban things with technology for examples, cyber bullying, steal ID form other person, or to trick the young person. Finally, technology is good for communicates with other people that lives far away or other country.

Furthermore technology had good benefit for the people life and essential for young person, but no all people usable good for example, the young uses sometime only for play game or post ban things in social minded. So technology can be has positive effects on people's live, if the people can be use right the technology.

Sometime technology can be effects people because when the other people used social minded for make bullying to other person, this person can be effects emotionally.

My Mom and my Dad say "" in the past was hard to communicates because did't have technology (telephone,table,or computer) so before use letter to communicate with other person, but to take long time. Now is more easy to communicate because the people have cellphone.

CD52F56B2392,"I disagree with the school board.That they should had more time in school. They have no time to do anything after school. They also will not do their school work because they won't have time to do there homework and they have to go to sleep because they will have school the next day, and they won't get a good grade because they didn't do there homework and there is reason why school board add more time.

Why they should not add more time in school because people won't have time to do anything because they will have to do other things too. This is why the should board should not add more time in schools. 1 They have to do there homework. Number 2 they have things to do for after school or they have a plan for after school, Number 3 they have to go somewhere. If the school board add more to the school hours that means that they will have no time for anything.

Reason number 1 They have to do there homework,they won't have time to do there homework because they don't have a lot of time because when come back for school they

are doing something and the end they don't do there homework,because they have to go to sleep and they need to go to school the next day.

Reason number 2,They have to do something or the have plan's to do after school. For a example Generic_Name need to pick up his sister and brother form school but he can't because the school board add more time in the school.That is the other reason why the school board add more time to the school.

Reason number 3,They have to go somewhere. For example PROPER_NAME needs to go to church after school because the church is 2 hour of class when he comes back it is 8:30 then he eats then he goes to sleep because he has school the next day when he went to school he got in trouble because he didn't turn in his homework. That is another reason why school board should not add more time to the school hours because they want have time to do their school work.

reason number 4,They will get broad in the class room,For example the teacher is talking forever that they will sleepy and they are going to be sleeping in your classroom, because they been sitting down forever then they won't do there work, because there getting tried.That is the other reason why school board should not add time to the school.

That's why I disagree with the school board by adding more time to the school hours, because the students won't have time to do their school work and other things, because school will end late, because if they add more time the students will not do there project or there homework,because they don't have time to do school work.Then they will get a F and that class because they did't do there homework or school work.

CD5F70E5C1D7,"To begin with, in my opinion i think students and parents should get the choice to be involved in any type of extracurricular activties. and why im saying this is because the school does not have no right to tell you you can do this and that but if they ask you to stay to finish some school asignments or afterschool studying then i suggest you stay after if you really want to finish those assignments and get a good or decent grade on it. or if you want to do great in school or in any job and you need a lot of school for that type of job then you might want to do as much of extracurricular activites.

Second of all, if the parents dont think that you are going to do good enough in school after the extracurricular activites and if you dont have enough time for study sessions or you homework because your to tired from sports such as football, basketball, lacrosse, and soccer. then ask your teacher or whoever is controlling the activties and ask them if you can get off a little earlier because you dont have enough time for homework, studying, or FAMILY or for yourself or your friends.

but i think the school should give the students and thier faimly diffrent choices of extracurricular activties so the students can pick 2 or 3 diffrent types of them instead of not having time for thier own life. like the students can pick and choose the 2 or 3 they really want or like to do or they can pick the ones that's going to help them the most in the future of school or in thier adult life, because teachers can teach the students things from extracurricular activites that they learned or did so they wont have to ask no one else for help or hire somebody then from that you can save money and you can also get money if you help someone that doesnt know how to do that type of thing.

And thats why i think it should be the students and parents choice if the students want to or not do extracurricular activities. because the school doesnt think about the students family or what they got going on at that time they just want to boss the kids around and tell the students to go ot not go.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
CDBB3ACAD2C8,"Honesty is a good policy because you are being strong, even thought honesty can hurt some people. I also feel that you are being responsible,mature enough to tell the truth. Some people can't be honest sometimes and that's okay because not everybody is the same, we all are different. I will say I like honesty because I don't like when people are not honest with me, so that's why I like to be honest with them. If they are not honest with me than that's totally fine, I'm not going to force them on being honest with me. But in the other hand I will have to agree being honest is a good thing to do. You never know what could happen if you lie an any case. I could disagree but I won't because people need respect and I'll show them that I can be honest with anybody. Honesty is good, It might help others think good, different in a way, but smart. I know how people feel when they tell a lie and I don't feel comfortable with it, at all. Aproving to this is good, why? why because people will like to be honest to, and they need to learn how to do it. They need to let go of shy, and be confident, agree with yourself if you will like to be honest. If you don't, then don't push your self, If you don't want to be honest and hurt somebodys feelings is okay, it all happens. But we still have to be respecful to others and all treat them the same. Like I said I will like to be honest with others so they can know how I feel about stuff or how I feel in my own way. I'm not trying to be mean if i'm honest, I'm just letting it go how I feel. But don't just go to others and say how you feel about them because that is just really disrespectful. It's good to be honest to your parents because they have always been there for you. Be honest with your friends, they are like siblings to you, they won't judge. Be honest with the people you trust or see them hurt an any type of way, help them feel happy, grateful, they will appreciate it alot, seeing that you stood up for them, that you helped them do something succesful. trust me they will be greatful. you are being productive. People will appreciate it alot if you help someone close to them, they'll see you are one of a kind! Just be honest with people and if they might hurt others feelings, try to say it in a nice way, don't be mean to them. And if they get it, they will like that you were being honest with them.

determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how may be done if we always doing.

"" it make think about how much a person can accomplish is the person is always doing someting.

If we always are doing something we learn more. For example: I work with my parents in construction and thanks to that I learn many things that I can use for my future.

We can accomplish almost everything. Why I said almost? for the simple reason: do you like what are you doing?. Example if you want to do the best doctor ever, but your parents want you be a famous lawyer; you will strive for be a doctor no matter what.

We will learn the value of the things that our parents do for us. Example: I come from of a little country in Latino America.

CE19B516A167,"should the school board add one and a half hour to school each day? The school board should add one and a half hours to school each day. I agree with the school board plane to add one and a half hour to school because it would effect the students learning and help them get more smarter and it would effect the school worker's because they money they get payed will increase.

1 first of all the school board plane to add one and a half hour to school each day.

if the school board add one and half hour to school if will effect the student because they will be able to have more time to study with they teacher which help them gain more learning. for an example when Generic_Name was 10years old in Generic_City, he use to not like school because he had school from 7am to 4pm and the teacher's use to force them to do homework,classwork and all the learning he needed it felt like being a maid having someone telling him to do this and that he hated the teacher but he learned a lot from them and him and his classmate still cared they teacher's teaching everywhere they went and it's very helpful, for an example they teacher's was like your parent's telling you to do something you don't wanna do they know is good for you but still you don't wanna do it so they force you to do it then you get mad over them for doing that which they find it helpful for you later in life in fact you hate them at that moment for what they did, but after years when your adult you get struggle about something and you remember what she thought you and you find it helpful the how our teacher's was like back then in Generic_City, the more hour's we had the more smarter we got . This evidence show's that the more time we got learning with our teacher's the more smarter we got. clearly sometime's the teacher's rush teaching when they do not have enough time and that does not help the student so the more time the teacher's get to teach the more student understand the subject well without rushing through the subject.

2 I agree with the school adding one hour and a half to school each day.

perhaps if they do add one hour and a half to school each day it really help the student and teacher's because they will have enough time learning not rush through learning. for an example when i was in school back then in Generic_City, Generic_Name was in classes doing his work but the classes hour's was short so this time when he did not have enough time to do the classwork in class the class hours was like

1hour and 30minites in math class the teacher told us to '' turn your work in it's time to go '' innocent didn't have enough time so he try to rush through it so he can get it done.

after week's innocent got 60% on my classwork he was disappointed in himself innocent wished he had more time to finish it was not the teacher's fault so he didn't blame the teacher because they did they best to make sure we had enough time. if we had enough time it would had really helped us all student's and teacher's.

in addition for student's to have better grade they need more time to focus and do they work in class.

clearly if school board add one hour and a half to school it will effect student's grade because they will have enough time to do they work in class and not rush.

In conclusion the school board should add one hour and a half because it will effect student learning and it will also effect they grades too so it will be a good thing to add one hour and half to school each day sometimes the student don't have enough time to do they work and they need sometime to finish but they can't and that effect the decrease the student grades. like in the story when the boy name Generic_Name in his school they didn't have enough time to do they classwork so he rushed through it and got bad grade, so if student's have enough time to do they work in class it would be very helpful to the student's. if the school board add one hour and half the student's grade will be different all they need is just more time to do they work in class and not rush through they work the more time they get to do they work the better they grades will get and the smarter they become.

CEAD27DE3263,"We tend to accomplish more if we always do something. In my opinion, I think that if people want to accomplish more, then they would do more to make their lives better. For example, a teen who gets eight hours of sleep before school wont be tired then a teen who slept for three hours. The teen who slept more will accomplish a successful school year because he slept earlier. Responsibility is a big role of being able to accomplish something; unfortunately, not everyone's responsible.

There are many ways someone can accomplish something, but they all start out with them taking action. as an example I'm going to use Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Both of these men started out with nothing. no one knew who these two men were 13 years ago. But that all changed when both of them announce their new technology. If it weren't for them, no one would have these useful items: IPhone, Android, Xbox, Window computers, etc. However, the reason they accomplished all that, was because they both studied and worked hard.

Inactivity can also serve a purpose in a person in my opinion. I think that people who do not want to accomplish something is because they do not want to push themselves into doing so. Another reason I think that they're not pushing themselves is because they don't have anyone to support them or help them out. Those are two main reason why I think people are inactive.

In conclusion, we do accomplish more if we are always doing something. you cannot simply do nothing and wait for it to be accomplished by itself. everything thing you do now will lead to a bigger accomplismnet. If you want to be sucessful, you always have to do something, Even though it's little things like helping your parents cook, or washing the dishes. ",4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.5,4.0

Would you get out of your comfort zone and chase your biggest dreams? I agree with Emerson statement because, how will you get better, being unique from everybody ,and the end result when you accomplish your goal. This is why i agree Emerson's statement.

PRACTICE.MAKES.PERFECT. I know you've herd this phrase a billion times from your family or friends. This is what Emerson is trying to say. How can someone be better without practicing. Furthermore, how can someone grow without working hard as you can? When i was in middle school i wanted to be in the basketball team. But, i was not good at it. One of my best friend who was in the team told me that he will tech me everything, only if i wanted to work hard and keep practicing with him everyday. We practiced everyday in till tryouts, whenever tryouts came i did really good and i got in the team. i've gotten better from working hard and never giving up on myself.

Do something different from everybody else. My father always told me that when i bring up college. He wanted me to do something big. Yet, not only big but unique unlike everyone else. In my last year of high school i was thinking about taking an online class. So, i got into a online course that will not only give me a credit and see how a online class really works. At the start it was hard for me. Because, i was getting out of my comfort zone. Just imagine being in your house or class with no teacher to help you. However, two weeks later i've gotten better at it. Two months later i finished the class with a B+.

At the end of all of your hard work and time, it will be worth it. When i was taking my online class i was scared, now i feel like i can do all of my classes online if i wanted to. Because, i've experienced it. Its all because of practicing alone or with somebody,also getting out of your comfort zone. You are going to do something beyond if you tell yourself to do so.

Some people say that you dont need to try to do somethings different to grow. Well their wrong here's why, most people cant get used to anything without trying to do so. Moreover, you dont need to master something to grow,because if you try you will now your right from your wrong.

CEC5B40D1688,"The technology that humans have developed is very advance; a lot of time has been dedicated to it, so society can have a better and easier way to access to technology. However, as all things that are crated by man are not perfect, and it has its positive and negative impacts on people. A lot of those impacts that technology have are negative impacts. For example, you loose the opportunity of interacting with other people, you can get addicted to technology, and you can get lazy, and all these negative impacts affect the new generation the most. The little kids end up playing video games their entire childhood; instead of playing outside, and making new friends.

First, technology it is not just to have fun with; you can play video games, but keep in mind that if you abuse of the use of technology you are going to get addicted in a very short period of time. Spending all your time in technology have its consequences. You loose the opportunity to be in contact with the people around you, you can loose your friends if you had any, and most important you can loose your communication that you once had with your parents. You can have hundreds of friends on social media, but it is not worth it if you do not spend time with them. Also one of the most negative impact is that little kids are getting addicted to technology. They are spending most of their childhood playing video games, and doing things that are not going to do any good for them in the future. They should be playing outside with their friends, and enjoying their childhood which is one of the most beautiful things they have. When you are a little kid you are so innocent that you do not have to worry about any problems the adults may have, and you do not have any problems to worry about either. Unfortunately that childhood have to end at some point because nothing last forever, but in the meantime you just have to live your childhood and not worry about any video games.

Second, you can use the internet for any need you may have, for there are hundreds of websites of anything you would like use. For example, shopping online, checking out book, and get any information you want. Some other websites are not quite useful like scams, or some websites that contains virus. At some point you may or may not run into a scam website which are used to obtain personal information that you have put online. They can get that credit card information that you used for your online shopping, your social security number, or even your own bank account number. There are people that work on trying to protect your personal information; they use their knowledge for the good of society, but there are also people who uses their skills and try to get your personal information, and use it for their own benefit. Keep in mind that those people can be smarter than you, and they can take every single dollar that you have in your bank account if you put your information at risk.

Third, you become lazier when you can get any information you want without making a big effort because you have everything at the reach of your hand by having access to the internet. You got so used to getting things fast and without making an effort, and when you have to wait to get any kind of information you get frustrated, for the fact that you have to go through a whole book, so you can that information. Man have been making your life easier by creating all the technological advances you have now. For example, you do not have to make an effort to wash your clothes, or wash the dishes you have been given all of that, so you have became lazier.

At the end technology can result positive impact to society; it has made our life easier, but it has resulted in a negative impact for the new generations. It has made the youth lazier than it was in the old times; teenagers are now addicted to social media, and we are loosing the communication with our parents which is very important to have. Little kids are loosing their childhood in result of the new technological advances that allows them to be playing video games and not going outside to make friends. Technology has put the security of our information at risk by no protecting it enough. Maybe it is the way we use technology, but it has more negative impact than positive impact to our communities around the world.                              ",4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0
CED4F9C63B9B,"The first impressions are almost impossible to change because when people meet new person, their personal information is only what is she or he looks like, so it is hard to change their first impressions, and people do not often change the first impressions.

Firstly, they find the first impressions and guess the person who is she or he because that is what human does every single time when people meet new person. For example, student meets new person who does not look healthy body and the student guess the boy cannot play any sports by seeing his body, but people says that he is the best player on the team. Even if the student watch his game and he plays really good, it is difficult to change the first impressions because he still does not look like athletic person and the student knows how unhealthy he is.

Secondly, people do not often change the first impressions because it is individual opinion so they want to keep it in their mind. For example, there is a man who is very shy and show people that he does not want to talk to anyone, so people decide that not to talk to him. Some day, he talks to his friends and find out he loves talking with people. But his first impressions are shy and not talking with anyone so people cannot talk to him because they are not able to change his first impressions.

However, some people could change the first impression as long as making a good relationship with a person who talks to. For example, there is a man who is really big and angry face. Everyone afraid of talking to him, but a student tries to talk to him and the student find out he is a nice person to talk. Sometime, people can change their first impression which makes the person feel better so the student can talk to easily.

In addition, it could be possible to change the first impression by showing difference between now and before. For example, a student who is being mean to some friends. But some day, the student realize that it is not good to being mean to friends, so he shows the difference which is being nice to friends and helping people instead of being a mean person. Although, the friends change the first impression of the person which makes both of them happier and be able to make better friendship.

In spite of these issues, it is still almost impossible to change the first impressions. So everyone should not focus on the first impressions too much.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,4.0
CEE41F7526FA,"I have some reasons why I would disagree with the school board because I don't like the idea of staying more time in school. Either way it is not a good idea because the school would face alot of work with the time extended plus it's gonna be more work than ever with the school extending. And I have a lot of reasons why its a bad idea so I guess start the reading the paragraphs right now.

First extending the school day would get a lot of students mad at the school because they want to go home and do whatever they want. The students would have to stay longer in the school and some would be mad and some be happy about it. And students that are bulllies would have a bigger chance on picking on people during the extended time of school. The next day the school would most likely be getting emails from students and parents complaining about the extended school day. While other students and parents wont care and go to school like a normal day and al lot more.

Also the jobs in the school could change like the teachers job and other jobs in the school time would be extended. Some teachers would complain by the extended school day if there gonna do a extended day everyday they are gonna have to be payed more or else the school would die slowly because all teachers,staff and other jobs in the school would quit and go work somewhere else better and get paid more. If one teacher does quit their job because of the extended time he/she would most likely tell other people that the school is terrible then the school would barely get people to work there and in a couple years later probably the school would be abandoned for other people to explore to see the leftovers of the dead school.

Finally the school would change by alot than before it ever has in its couple years of existance. The school would have to face a lot of consequnces like a lot of students posting on the internet about how the school is trash,boring and now they want to go to a different school. And the teachers would complain about if they are going to teach more than ever they want to get bad even more money. And they would have to change the whole school time of the day,the bus time and the students classes time which would took a very long time to do. Either way other jobs in the school would be more difficult than ever for example janitors,staff and teachers.

Even though the school really does want to change original time to a extended time it's not the smartest idea in the world because theres gonna end up being consequnces to it and they are not going to be fun for anyone. Either way next thing you know the county that owns the school will just die because of the extended day. Because then who knows probably no one then later on wants to go the either school in the county anymore and would probably just moved out to go to a better school. So this is why this idea is a bad idea. ",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5
CF290C0884F0,"To conserve the energy and resourse, we do not should have to work a four-day for week. Some jobs, work during the week, and others in the weekend days. We can not conserve it much of the resourse or energy even they give four days of work, because some workers do their jobs in the week days, others will do it in the weeekend days. This is because there are a lot differents types of jobs, that do not permit they to work only in the week days. Add to more hours its not make a diference because some job are in the night, some in the mornings.. Most of the people they have off and want to go outside to have fun or go to a restaurant have dine, some bussines have to be open in this days that the people have off and want to do something in the weekend day. In my position I don't think we conserve the energy and resourse doing in a four-day work week. It's have to be nesesary that the businesses have people working and open their bussines the 7 days, to those people who go to their businesses. Schools must don't have to chanche the five days to four days in the week. Students can adopted the two hours more but, they will be have three days to spend their time.

One reason why I will be desagree if the system want to change the schedule of the schools is because it's going to affect most of the students, since they don't have a job and will be pass must of the time in their fhones, using the internet, social media, wathing tv or playing video games. Students will be doing nothing productive in their lifes doing this we will waste most of our time. This will be affect in our lifes, I take a position in this situation because I am a students and I know the students hobbies what we like to do, what not and how we wasting our time.

However to add two more hours in the workers scheddule. It can be good for some of them because they don't have towork 3 days, but also going to affect most of the workers, that are parents. Most of the parent can not aply to work the week days. Suppose they aply for work the 4 days, but can be diferents days like their are a lot jobs that have diferents schedule. Monday to Friday, Sunday to Thursday, or Wednesday to Monday.

Schools also chanching the schedule, parents will be have to pay for babysitting for those who have kids.

Not all people have a government job the require only work the week day and weekend days off.

Most of the businesses ask to work 5 to 6 days and which its not have to be Monday through Friday.

Also we can see it's imposible to change to the four-day to conserve the resourses even people work 4 days. People have to work between the 7 days, some have to work 4 days and when this people have off the other half have to work that days because businesses can not be close the 7 days. People must will have to work even diferents day.

In conclusion for me it is not a goog idea to change the schedule of the students, to a four-day, when they have 5 days. Students can do more work in school and learn more and develop their knowladege passing more time in the school. Can be good idea for the people who work because they can have rest more time with family, or doing hobbies. Work 10 hours its good for those who will have off 3 days, but not for students because students have to develop in school more time. ",3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.5
CF453C152FD5,"This is an easy choice technology has a negative affect on people. There are many reason why but three big ones are. one you lose a lot of communication skills. another is you only see things through your phone. And finally you lose family time or time with friends .

The first reason is people lose communication skills. such as you dont see people face to face you are just texting them and you dont know how to talk to them in person so you dont hang out with them you just text them. and they pretty much just a become and online friend. another example of this is during a job interview you don't know how to talk to someone. it's really hard to do stuff when someone doesn't have communication skills. and you can get food online so you won't have to talk to people.

most people just see things and hear about stuff thats happening. don't go and explore or experience thing the just go on the Internet. because everything around us is technology based. you can't go anywhere without the internet or a TV. so everyone has gotten used to that so they don't have a need to go out or play outside if they have games on there phone,computer,iPad. so people don't have to travel because you can face time people or use other apps to see people. you can order food from uber eats so you don't have to leave your house and people won't know how it feel to be in a restaurant.

finally people wont be spending time with family because of the internet. because someone could be watching a YouTube video and then another then after a while it could be dark outside and you just lost the day and havent said anything to your parents because you have been watching YouTube or Netflix. people get used to that life style and a lot people won't change because its become a habit and its a bad habit to over come. people also forget about there friends because they just wanna be on there phone alone watching videos,playing games , watching TV. and you forget about family and friends not on purpose and you still do it without knowing. And its not just kids it's also adults. They pay everything online so they only leave for work and nothing else. then come back order food or get groceries online. and cook while watching TV or on Facebook .",3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5

D0D7C3A056CE,"Should people make their own decision ? or should people seek for guidance ? I think you should live your life the way you want to live it with the guidance of your parents because they already lived theirs. Our parents have experienced life and it's challenges and which they would want the best for us and nothing else. For example you are looking to purchase a car, you would ask your parents for their thoughts and guidance because they have already been there done that. Deciding what you would want to be in life, Now thats a choice you choose on your own, you choose if you want to be successful in life, you choose if you wanna have a big house, a nice car, a good job thats all you from what i've learn in life is that nothing is gonna be done by it's self. You are not gonna get what you want if you dont get up and handle it yourself.

I look up to my older brother because he moved out with a goal and that goal was to own his own car, his own apartment by the age of twenty one and still going to school part time. I aspire to be like him so hard working and with a goal to do it all by himself with the guidance of my parents of course. But thats not the point, the point is that he left my parents house with a goal, determination, and self trust he always told me that its all about taking risky decisions in life.

Nobody cant make you do anything but yourself the only person that can harm you is yourself the decisions you make in life will impact yourself. You decide what is right or wrong in the real world because outside of high school its a whole different ball game you are gonna make bad decisions and good decisions but its okay mistakes will happen and mistakes are good because you will be able to learn from them and grow as a whole. i think mistakes are a blessing because i know that my parents both made mistakes and some a regretful and some are a blessing that you will learn and live to tell on.

I think it's important to have something or someone to inspire you to motivate you have to trust your own gut because you can always look up to them. Or be someone a person can look up too, be motivation for someone else be someone you want to be in life. But its not just gonna be handed to you you have to work for it there are always gonna be obsticals in the way or challenges in the way but you have to tell your self to just keep swimming.

D15E85D292CE,"""Cell phones"", for the main statement I must evacuate cell phones in school time. Students are often breaking ""expectations"" about using your cell phone in class. But some schools choose to use cell phones for educational purposes only during that time. Now, we should be able to see why cell phones are doing to the students of any school. Cell phones may disrupt students' work, make them feel misplaced, and make them rebellious.

Cell phones may disrupt students' work. This may happen when students play games or text in their cell phones. Probably when students might make them less focus on their work just checking social media. Students of many ages have trouble enough with their homework and also classwork. May cell phones be causing this to begin with? Maybe, just so we know cell phone may disrupt students' work.

Cell phones may make them feel misplaced. What I mean for that is a student just be on their cell phones a lot, an student may just feel better on their phone instead of doing work. which makes the student disconnect with class time. Not even using it to complete work making a opinion sound like a fact. As we know cell phones may make them feel misplaced.

Cell phones may make them rebellious. Another meaning by this is to disrespect authority. ""Authority"" means the staff of the school of any kind of departments. Some students in blood are rebellious, but not the man made kind. They may feel furious when criticize for anything done on phone. They may feel like that anytime with the main disturbance of the classroom. So cell phones make them rebellious.

Next,our argument against cell phones is extremely important to all others expect the students. Students will fight back other supporters of the opposite answer hes been fighting against. My counter argument settles the fact cell phones are not good in class room for any time. Now, students would be more efficient without cell phones than with cell phones. So, this has settled against everyone.

In conclusion, Students think their doing a great work with a cell phone in deck. But in reality, it is making you more and more dependent with your mind. But many people actually learn from it. Either you have a learning style or make great grades with cell phones must see the negatives of this. Other students using cell phones may disrupt students' work, make them feel misplaced,

One of the reasons, I like to work in group when we are doing a project or classwork for English class is because I know my classmates and working together we can share more ideas of how we are going to create a magnificent project and impress our other classmates and specially to you our great teacher.

The other benefit will be to finish our work faster because everyone in the group will collaborate with some work that it will help us to finish the work without worrying to turn in the project late because we will help each other to get the work done and get a good grade as a group.

On the other hand, most of my classmates prefer to work by themselves because they do their project the way they wanted to create it and they like to have just their ideas in their work. Also, they don't like to be working with classmates who are only playing and not taking the work serious.

Overall, working with a group shows, how the students or other people become more successful not only in a business, but in classes too you can get good grades and have done an excellent work.

Japan, the one place in the world I would like to visit.

Whenever people mentioned this country, I believe that what they're thinking to are the scenes and foods over there. However, the such beautiful scenes in Japan is also the one thing that attracted me. The blossom tree is the most beautiful image I have been wanted to see from Japan. Many little pinky leafs formed numerous soft and fluffy flowers. And now, just imagine that when all leafs are falling off from the tree, that scene just looks like many butterflies are dancing in the sky. Only this image is enough to grab all people's attention from the country. Sometimes just bring your food outside and find a blossom tree, then sit under it, looking at the image while eating. I think that's a such enjoyable thing.

D26C9B0368D0,"No, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home. There is a lot of action students have to take from being home school.

For example the state has to make sure their doing their work instead of sleeping and lacking around. You have to be responsible and be aware of your work. I'm not saying all students can't attend online classes at home, but most cannot.

Going to school helps you learn and understand things better. if you dont get something, you can ask for help and the teacher can explain the problem to you. You also have a person teaching you instead of you reading things by yourself and trying to understand. Being in class accurate and up can keep you from falling asleep instead of sitting around at home eating and sleeping all day. In addition of other students because i can't speak for everybody, some students can handle that and learn way better on their own than having somebody teach them.

School groups is also another reason how student learn faster and better. Working in groups help you learn more from other students. Other students may know more than you or you might know more than them, which is a good thing. Everybody has their own ideas and opinions. You can't forget some students are antisocial and like to work alone. If you are one of them people, than working alone and at home is best for you because you have nobody around to bother you.

Another reason being home schooled isn't a good idea because you have to be responsible. Doing your work, making sure you up, and making sure you finishing it on time. You have to make sure you get up on time, not staying asleep to long, or staying on your phone. Being at school you have to get what you need done, at home is like you know what you need done but you can do it later. Which makes you lazy, staying at home eating,sleeping,and playing on your phone makes you lazy. Its gonna make you forget that you have school to do. On the other hand some students are responsible. They know what have to get done and they get it done with or without any one telling them what to do or reminding them.

School is learning place where you come and get your knowledge from. Every parent should put their child in some learning program where they get taught not taught on their own.

Some students want to take a career during they study but some students don't wanted to thinking about any career when they study in the school.

First, for example people want to know what do you want when you study if you think is more import ants to take a career when you study, and you are young most students know that is more important because you think about you future, and you want to try to progress you life maybe for give your parents a better life when they can to help you because they are older for work.

Secondly, we have many people in the world want to progress in his life because they think is more better for the future have a better life with your family, but is more important to know what do you know what career do you wants for progress your life because we have many career in the world that you progress better some students like to take a career more difficult like technology, teacher, technical and polices but any career progress your life.

However, students don't want to know what they want for his future because they thinking I was in the school I am young, and is the reason when they don't want to take a career during the students is study, but I think is important to think your future a career for helping your parents maybe your uncle, sister, brother, but we have many students they want to go to the school for have friends, girlfriends, boyfriends, and don't progress his life many people have problems about drug, drink, and fight.

In conclusion, I agree with this position to take a career before you graduate because is more easy to know want do you want to know what career you are interesting for progress your life is better know before that after because you have a career, and your mind have this position to take a career for better life maybe when you almost done you have what career you have for making money, and try to help your family in your life",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0

D5588B5DD6FF,"Once The great artist Michelangelo said that

""The grater danger for most of us lies not only setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark"". I personally disagree with this because not all of us people really wants to more than what it is asked to do, what really matter in this world it is to achieve your goal, and aiming low is a representation of honesty and humility. Some people may say that this may agree with Michelangelo's said, because sometimes getting out of our comfort zone it is what most of us should do; challenge our selves to get even higher expectation and results, but to be realistic not all of us aims for that.

First of all, most of us do not really wants to do more than it is asked to do. For example, Generic_Name a orange contractor, he has been asked from his boss to fill 10 trailers of orange per day, one day he filled 12 trailers of oranges and thought that his boss would pay him the 2 trailers extra of orange that Generic_Name and his worker filled, in his paycheck did not appear the 2 extra trailers of orange causing Generic_Name pay his workers for the extra hours and work that they had putted, Generic_Name never again did more of he was asked to do. People took Generic_Name as en example of not doing more of what it is asked to do in their jobs.

Secondly, what really matters in this life is to achieve your goal. For example Generic_Name is a student from Generic_School, Generic_Name and his friends in their freshman year aimed for the advanced diploma in his school, but Generic_Name aimed for the standard diploma, his friends bought that by choosing the advanced diploma would be easier to earn credits and graduate faster, but little did they know they would get challenging classes, having almost AP classes in almost every material, Generic_Name from the other side having his standard diploma resulted him having normal classes and passing almost all of them. At their junior year Generic_Name's friends decided to change their diplomas because their classes was so difficult that their credits was not high enough, Generic_Name had the needed credits to be considered a graduate. Sometimes it is better to achieve your goal and do not try to get out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself because at the end what really matter in this life it is to achieve your goal.

Lastly, aiming low is a representation of honesty, and humility. For example, Generic_Name have a Mexican restaurant, she does not aspire her restaurant to be the greatest in her town, but what she really aspires for her restaurant is to keep her with the same love and passion she has for cooking and the satisfaction of her clients. Aiming low does not mean that is going to be a failure, but if you do it with honesty and humility, the 'danger' will not be as big as it appears.

As you can see, Michelangelo's said its not all the way truth because, people from all over the world thinks differently, having different experiences in their lives causing them to disagree on his said. Not all the people wants to more what it is asked to do, what really matter in this world it is to achieve your goal, and aiming low is a representation of honesty and humility. Not always setting our aim too high and falling short it is what it means to survive in this world.",4.0,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.0,4.0
D5E3716C5E49,"I think students should come up with their own summer projects design because, students can come up with really creative projects, could have more fun doing their own design projects,and will have less stress over the summer.

Students can come up with really creative projects over summer by researching experiments, or about someones life. A student can look up science experiments to do as their projects that could be entrusting for the class or for them selves to. Also they can talk about a famous person or about someone in their family and explain why they wrote about that person. Students can invent new projects and show off to the class and explain how they came up with it and what will their invention help them or others.

Students could have more fun creating their own projects. Students will be more exited to be able to do create their own projects then follow a boring one a teacher assigned everyone. Students can come up with really creative work if you let them free roam. Students could in joy doing work that doesn't have to follow a checklist. Students could also can work on a project with their friends.

Lastly students can feel less stress about doing a project. Students will be able to work on a project without having to stress about it being perfect or if its following the checklist. Students can come up with their own checklist and show their classmates how they came up with it so the other students can do it one day for fun.

Some say that students are expected to know to the career that they want to have so that they take specific class for that career.

All though some say that high schools students should not be expected to know what specifice career they want. Frist peopel tented to chang over time so somthing that you might have liked three years ago you might not like that much anymore. Second you cant really telll if you like somthing intell you try it. Lets say that Generic_Name has wanted to be a teacher her whole life but then she gets the job and finds out that she is not that happy with her job and that she should have tryed other class in high school. Finaly most student dont really think about thier careers intill the last two years of high school.

actuily all students should know what they want thier career to be by the time they are in high school. Frist if student where to know what they want there career to be they could take specific class for that career. By students not having to take other class that they dont need it would help them focuse more because they whouldnt have to worry about having to take or study for a test in a class that they dont need. Finally if a student was to be taking class that he/she wants they would show up to class more because they would be intersteded.

Thats why I belive that students should know what career they want when they get into high school. Because it would help them out and even make thier life esay. Even if that idea was to chang but it all ways good to have a goal so that you can acive it.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0

When ever you ask someone for their opinion about something, you shouldn't expect what they tell you. You should be aware that it might not work and might not go the way you want it to go or the way you expect it to go. Before you do anything tell your self, ok, if this doesn't go right, this is my fault not the person I asked advice for.

Also when you ask a person for advice and it does work, make sure before you ask the person make sure you say thank you because somtimes people just walk away from you pretending your not even there when they know your asking them something. so just know that your thankful for people wanting to listien to you and wounder what you need or what you need information on.",3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5

D6C9DE61BAF4,"There are three examples about if I agree or desagree about the statement ""It has been said that a positive attitude is the key success in life"". I agree with this statement about the importance of attitude and I will give some reasons.

Firts example, one reason that why I agree with this statement is because,if you want to apply for a job, you need to have a positive attitude to be sucessful for other people because they want to see the best of you and if you can have that job and how you relate with other people and you will see the results about it . Many people with bad attitude are lay off of their work because at work you have to show your best attitude with the costumers,boss or with other workers but some people don't do it . If you are the boss, you needs to have a positive attitude or try to have it because your workers hope the best attitude of you to manage the job and that can show respect of your person.

Second example, another reason that why I agree with this statement is because all people desserve positive attitude like, if you are walking at the park and you say ""hi"" or ""have a good day"" to other person with a positive actitude they will feel good and they would think that you are a good person . Be a person with a positive attitude can be successful for yourself or for your family for example, if one of the family members has a bad day and they see you, his mood can change because of your positive attitude, you make him feel better with advices about how he needs many options to resolve his life but if you have a bad attitude you make him feel irate of you.

Third example, the last reason that why I agree with this statement is because, if you are in the school there are many teenager like you that have hard classes, but some of them have a positive attitude because they want to have a good grades, pay attention in class and try to help other students who needs it, they try to make them sucessful too, so they can have a good grades or a good future . But, if they have a bad attitude they would be have bad grades,they don't pay attention in class,they try to distract the students who want to pay attention,make argument about the class or sometimes they scape the class because they feel that they have a bad attitude and that's why it has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life.

In conclusion,in this three examples I give reasons that why I agree or desagree with the statement ""It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life"".

The energy, and the resources are the most important factors in the world, for the evolution and survival of the human. There are many types of resources such as money, products, and energy power. Factors that have supported the human life for long time, and actually continue it happening. Every body in this world must be career it, because these resources are helping us to survive ,and support our life style. But the sad-reality is that the human does not career it, because they do not know about the consequences or they are ignorant. We need to rectify our mistake, and keep safe our resources. This written will be about advice, benefits, disadvantages, and plans how career our resource.

Let talk about the benefits that we are go to get if we safe our resources. First, there is a plan or recommendation what is about adopt a four-day work week, with each days 10 hours work, and school days with two hours. This is as a way to save our resources, and obtain the following benefits; we are going to save the energy, food,internet, water, time (to spend in our life with the family or whatever we want), the deterioration of our clothes and shoes. We are going to help the environment to keep it safe from the pollution, to make a better style life for the humans, and save resources for critical moments in the world. As you can see there are many resources what we could save, if we have adopt this plan.

In this plan, there are many benefits but also disadvantages. For this time I am go to talk about the disadvantages, if we implement this project. There will be present many problem such as the loss of time to learn, time to work, we will lost our social life in the school as in the work, became a professional will be harder and tardy. The technology advance will be slower, and it is go to affect the human evolution. Then we will lose many important things, and resources. Factors that could support in life, and make it easier.

In conclusion, There will be many people whom will benefit from this project , but at same time it is go to make many problems cause the disadvantages. If we implement this plan, we must be able to understand, we are go to take our risk. Moreover we must be think about the risky that this could be, and prevent more problems than we already have. I recommended do not waste our time anymore, starting to create a better world with a better life style, and creating new project to save resources. This support or this type of project need to be created by the government, because they are whom have the power to control whole country. Now take career our resource became a new goals for me after reflect a topic as this.

D760EF65B80C,"Many people think that it is a great idea for high school students to only attend three years of high school education, by taking courses in the summer or in the evenings, It will allows you to graduate a year earlier than your orginal class year, I prefer to attend all four years of high school education, which means that i would attend all four traditional years of high school education, such as: Freshmen year, Sophmore year, Junior year, and Senior year, which is the last year of a student high school education. The reasons for my disagreement are: Age problems, Graduation issues, Lack of Experience, and Shortage of a summer break.

Firstly, lets talk about age problems that people who follows this plan are going to go throught. Freshmen students should be starting thier first year of thier high school career around the age of fourteen or fifteen years old, So they can graduate while turning the legal age of eighteen years old in the United States, Which is the correct age of finishing thier high school education. Sophmore students should be starting thier Sophmore year while turning the age of sixteen years old. There are few students that start thier Sophmore year at the age of fifteen years old, Which means that they attended thier first grade in Elementry school younger than others.

Secondly, Graduation issues, Graduation should be the most significant accomplishment in anyone's high school education, When following this program, You are not going to be able to graduate with the same class year as you for example; I graduate with my orginal class of year twenty-twenty. If following this program, you are going to be ahead of your friends and class year.

Thirdly, Shortage of summer, students only get two months as a summer break in the United States, before attending thier next school year. By following this program, you are not going to be able to go on vications and rest from the year that you attended. You must study the classes and cources that the program gives you, so you can finish all of your credits and graduate while your family are on vications having a good time.

Finally, In conclusion, this program will mess up your summer plans and would not benefit you with any new progress. I suggest the traditonal four years of high school education.",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0
D80ED2446C0E,"Setting examples by your own behavior to influence other people is better for many reasons but still has its pros and cons.

My first reason why is because the majority people around world learn and comprehend better when they have an example in front them. In addition it is easier to influence others by your behavior becuase you experience it everyday and it would be very easy to set an example.

My second reason is setting examples makes you a leader and when other people start to notice it they will strive to act upon that action because they where influenced and want to become a leader like you,soon more and more people will start doing it.

There is only one con and that is depending on the individual and situation that person might not be good at making self behavior examples because they may have not experienced it before but there is a solution for this problem. You can ask a smart adult and act upon there actions and carry it on. Nobody is perfect and its okay to ask for help sometimes.

D87F1B0CE93F,"Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" By saying this I believe he meant people should never be lazy but to always be working towards something. Not doing anything and waiting for something to happen is not realistic. Working hard to get something feels so much more cherish able. Being able to out figure a way to accomplish something can help benefit others.

I believe we always accomplish more if we are always doing something whether it be small things or big things, we always have to keep moving forward. By moving forward we get to discover new things and see a change. Working towards a goal helps us to become more aware and understanding of the world around us. By always doing something we are always moving forward no matter what it is. Not doing anything is bad because you are just wasting your time and sometimes other peoples time too.

An example of being active and it helping/benefiting someone is if a person gets good grades so they can get into a better collage. By working towards getting better grades the outcome is getting into a good collage. Working towards a goal is beneficial and an accomplishment.

Inactivity doesn't serve a purpose at all but maybe in small aspects it does. It all depends on the type of situation. For example if someone is having a bad day you can't change their mood they have to do it themselves so in this situation you can't do much for them. By not being active accomplishments aren't being met rather someone else doing it.

Actively working and trying to accomplish something is most ideal. Never attempting to do something is bad. Always try your best even if you feel like you can't. Trying is always the best option because at least you attempted to do something. Things can get done if we are always doing.                                                                             ",3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

Another beneficial that help's you to work in group is that they can finish he work more faster then working alone, because if you work alone it takes to much time to finish the work.

Sometimes when the teacher tell you to make a project and tells you that she's going to put groups to work you know that you don't have to speak by yourself because you know that your friends will help you to make it together. I think that work with someone else helps you to relax because sometimes you don't know something, but you can ask your friends if they know and they help each other, but sometimes it's better to work alone because no one distract you and if you have friends that would be distracting because if you trying to make your work and they playing aroud that will be extrecing even that you know that it's going to be more hard to finish your work you feel relax because everything that you doing its right. If i have to choice from working in groups or working by myself i wirll prefear to work in groups because i think that would be more help full for me.

D9018539576D,"Technology has had the biggest impact on human interaction. Most people might say it's made a positive impact on people's lives while others may disagree and say it's had a negative impact on people's lives. There may be some pros and there may be some cons to this situation. Can the impact of technology be a good or bad outcome?

Let's start off with the pros or the positive effects technology has had on people's lives, now technology has made people's lives easier. Some may say because it's easier to access what they need easier online instead of heading to the market. Some may also say it's easier and faster to call your friends or parents, any family member really, instead of driving all the way to them, which is true. Watching movies on your phone instead of going all the way to the movie theater and pay for your ticket and it only being a one time thing. There are countless positives outcomes of how technology has increased over the years. The technology nowadays makes everything faster and easier on people's lives. Unfortunately, all these great, glamorous, fast, and easy ways have some downfall to them.

Now, technology definitely has it's flaws and negative impacts on people's lives. Most can say there's not as much human interactions since technology has been brought upon people. Communication is key when interacting with one another. Today most people are also glued to their cellular device, not physically but you get the point. Especially teenagers, they have a bad habit of not being able to put down their cellphone. Whether that being during school hours, at home when you're supposed to be doing work, and maybe even at work. The generation we have today is usually all about social media, and just being on their cellphone in general 24/7. Point blank there's just no physical, verbal communication anymore between one another. It may be causing a lot of students to slack in school, and it may not only go for students and teenagers, they're not the only victims. Some particular parents may be also glued to their cellphone just as teenagers. It's not their fault nor do the teenagers have any fault in this. All this is because of the evolution of technology. It's not pleasant to live in a world with not so much communication and everyone being constantly glued to their cellphone nor is it pleasant to do awful in school because you can't put your cellular device down. Now, these are just some reasons and examples why technology has a negative impact on people's lives. Can you imagine how many more scenarios like this happen daily?

Though technology has evolved drastically through out the years and is still evolving now as we speak, there's always going going to be positive and negative impacts. Technology does help and allow people to complete tasks without having contact with others. There's the problem right there, there's no communication. Even though there are some positive effects of technology that doesn't change the fact that there are more negative effects than positive. Technology effects each person a different way, whether that being in a positive way or whether that being in a negative way. It's all a mix, and by mix I refer to positive effects and negative effects all over the place. Some people may disagree or may agree whether it's a bad mixture or a good mixture. Cell phones and all technology can make it easier or harder for certain people.

Whether if it truly is a positive or negative impact it will not change what people think or at what position they're in. Some people just like taking the easy way out and not cope with what they are losing and missing out on, communication. Human communication and interactions are not it anymore. Everyone's opinion and saying on this dilemma is different, people's mindsets are different even their actions are different from everyone else's,but this is my opinion. In conclusion, that is why I strongly, and genuinely believe technology has a negative effect on people's lives.            ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5.0

First reason is homework if we have more time in the school day how would students have time to do their homework. If we had a hour and a half more then teachers shouldn't give homework to students. students shouldn't have more time in school then have homework after school students have have some time to enjoy themselves and still do homework if we have more hours in school students wouldn't have the time to enjoy themselves. If students did their homework after they wouldn't have time to enjoy themselves after because it would be dark outside then they have to go to bed.

Second reason is students having time like i said in the other paragraph students wouldn't have time if we had more hours in school. students wouldn;t do fun after homework after school because by the time you know the sun would go down and it would be too late for anything. go out somewhere, play outside, and hang with friends.

Third reason why is because teachers. teachers would have more work in their hands teachers have a life too they need to get to their families too. and all the work they have to do would them holding longer which would keep longer away from their families too this is is why schools shouldn't have more hours in school     ",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.5

you can use or have your own car or you,

can take the public transport and go everywhere with out problems and if you want to go to another country you can! because the air lines exist now, and you can fly to go to the country you like.

So technology have a positive effect because is helping us to make our daily necessities at home or everywhere better, a reason why i think that is because the future of the students is going to be with more opportunities to learn what they like, with out saying excuses, the help of others is not going to be that necessary with technology in your hands; no body have to advocate for you with your problems and decisions.

Technology is going to be increasing, For example years ago you could not talk to your family or friends if they were too far away from you, in that edge the only thing you could do was write a letter and send it through mail and then the people who was waiting for it has to wait like one or two months; for have that note, but all that had changed too,

When the telephone was invented people start buying and using, that invent, for the public in general the telephone start to be necessary for the people for emergencies like call the ambulance or call the police in case that something dangerous could be happen;

years before, the history of the telephone became with new ideas like you can not just call with the telephone because is has be made it smart you can take pictures play read book and more, today the telephone have a drastic change is nothing like the old phone is something different. technology had changed our way to communicate and transport and a lot more.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0

It could be a girl or a boy that they're interesting on and their first impression may not be how his/her boss want it to be.

I agree with Aesop, no kindness is ever wasted.

First,any kindness can help others in life. First, anyone who is going through a rough time needs kind words to get them through it.

By showing kindness others can learn or do the same.

Second, showing kindness can have an impact in your life. First, others will be kind to you. Also, many people will know how to be kind to other people who are thinking bad. Lastly, everyone will know you are a kind and careiing person. By haveing kindness you""ll live a happy lif knowing that u do something good in life.

Lastly, being kind can help the community. First, we can all help pass food to people who are in need of it. Second, by cleaning up we can help keep the street cleans so wild anamils don't come. Lastly, we can have people come together and help the people who are homeless. By helping the community will have more people helping.

Giving advice, try to talk to them, Otherwise people does not have good behavior because sometimes they have a lot of problems at home. For example if i saw someone who is close to me like my best friend or something like that and they have a bad behavior.

I will try to find ways to helping being kind, nice, social and give new perspective to other people. Being good influence for them is very friendly, is good in all of the reason's. The bad influences are the peolpe who had a to much opportunities and they don't care.

Be influence for other people ""it depent's"" what's type of of friends did you have, and how you're parents educate you. Because friends can make you to get trouble at school or at home with parents that the bad influynces make it you. For example people with bad behavior tech you bad things in differents aspect and that people are not you're friends. But is that a life you can have nice friends, people who had a bad influence too, people who are a very good influences for you.

Giving people better influences can help you in your future, basically in everything. For example you can have a Social life, Friendly smile, Nice peronality, Kind and all of the others specialityes. A lot of people had a bad bahavior at school they influid their friends too. The problem is the major of students sometimes they have a bad life a lot of problems at home. That's why their bahavior is like that. Some of the parent""s does not care about their Son's or daugther's how is the behavior at school or anywhere. Because they are awesome kind of persons or parents can't get the control of them.

However, they are true friends who love you, help you to had a normal behavior some of youre're friends not all of them. some of the friends when they saw it that you in trouble they don't talk to you anymore. For example in my own persoanlity i never, ever get suspension or problems from the school. So that is what's fake friends do theyprefer to lose a comunication, but for some reasons are good because it people who are not a nice person with you, bad influence. So that are the reasons why cause not all of your friends be there for your when you need someone can be for you; True friends and good influeces be there anytime that you need help or talk to them that's why you had to select your friends. You have to know who are your real friends and who are not.

For instances, People can have a opportnity to had a better life, future is the kind of people who had a bad behavior. It the type of people who influid the better influence for bad honestly sometimes is sad when you see that.

But, anyways nothing can do about it because a lot of people try to help them. They don'n wanna put their part for be a better person, influenece for give new perspective. So people get tired to help and they continue in the same way. These are all of the reason's why some people had a bad behavior some don't.                ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.0

The benefits to working in group or working along.

The benefits to working in group are the we can't share information with other's to help amswer the problems the we working in and if i working alone i has to put my on ideas. My tree reasons to working in group are we will working all together, we get more support of the other people that are in my group and my last reason are the i will feel more relax and the tree reason that a think if i will working alone are the i has to support my ideas by my self, and if i get confuse nobaby can't help me, and my last reason are the i will feel more frustrartion to finish the work or if the idea the i put are not good. The benefit that i think can't help the student more are to work in group because we can't support other.

My first reason about working in group are the we work together and can't be more easy to finish the work in time to learn how work in group we will share some information to my group and all people that are in my group has to share some imformation i will feel more motivation to other's.

My second reason that i put the we can get more support because if we work in group we can't help each other's we lear to work in group that why a like more to working in group because some time if someone no know the answer we can't help hi or her to answer the question.

my last reason that i put in my essay are the we feel more relax because we can't not get frustrartion because the other's people that are in my group can't help us if sometime we can't get confuse to some preoblems they can't give us support to answer the problems .

That are my tree easons that why i likes to working in group that why i don't likes to work alone because some time can be more frustrartion to us and sometime we can't get more homewoork we can't give and get support because we work in to a group i think that is more easy to work in group because we can't support that ideas and we check if that ideas is good and not and coul be lest work to the other's because we can't share like one person do something and the other's person another thing about work that can't work .

Hello there!!! do you know that Albet Einstein is one of the smartest person that ever live, he discover by using knowledge and imagination. Then he said this "" imagination is more important than knowledge."" I disagree because you see you use imagination and knowledge in the rest of your life, when you work as a team you use imagination and knowledge and you need to be fast, strong, and smart, and imagination and knowledge is important. OK' let me explain why i disagree what Albert Einstein said.

First, when you was a kid you use imagination to make things, to draw, to make discoveres, and to have fun. When you grow older you will get knowledges and use it to pass your test, do your homework, and more, but you use your imagination too. For example by thinking, to brain strom, to make music and more, is the same thing however you use knowledge with imagination. Both imagination and knowledge, you have those things from your rest of your life!!! Starting when you were a kid and when you grow older you still use both imagination and knowledge, thats one of my important reason why i disagree.

Second, you use imagination and knowledge when you work with somebody or working as a team, making something or thing how can we make it stronger or how can we win. if your working as a team and battling a robot battle you use imagination to think whats the best robot to build and how to make it stronger, that one of the examples. If you play sports you use knowlege to think what to do, how to win, its the same but you use knowledge. However theres a battle that you work as ateam, using imagination and knowledge, it is a war!!! let me explain its beacause you use imagination to know whats the plan, what is the things were using and knowledge to know when to attack , that one of my reason, when using imagination and knowledge in a team you need to be fast, strong, and smart.

The last one, imagination and knowledge is important, because imagination and knowledge is both important because if kids can't imagine theres no knowledge or if there no knowledge there no imagination. Every body need imagination and knowledges to do what they want and both of these is fun like they can make things, they work as a team, and it will be at there rest of there life. This last body or body 3 is conneted in body 1 and body 2 this is the most important reason. If there's no imagination there's no knowledges, both of does is important every one need imagination and knowledge.

That's all my reason why i disagree that ""imagination is more important than knowledge"" both of those is important, you use it by playing, making, thinking, and more, that's all i have to say that i disagree on albert eintein.",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5

First, in my case if I see a beautiful girl, I start getting in love of that girl and having good impression about her, but may be I see something wrong that i don't like of her, I start changing my good impression that i had of her.

Second, when somebody watch YouTube videos, then that person person watch a publicity about the new amazing iPhone 11, he has good impression about the amazing iPhone 11, but when he buys the iPhone, he looks that the battery is not that good as he thought, so he change his opinion.

Third when I go to fancy restaurants, I see a lot of delicious food coming throw the tables, I have good impression and expectation about the restaurant, and I think that the food is delicious, but when I try to eat one of those plates, the food was disgusting and it didn't taste that delicious as it looks,that's because my impression change totally.

''To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you someone else is a greatest accomplishment '', is hard because we are in one world that the most important thing is the appearances more than what you are, most of the people prefer be and appears something that they can not be, for example most of the people when someone comment about how they look or how they are, some of them get frustrated, is a biggest accomplishment because they critic your form of walk, how you use your clothes and how you do the things.

We lives in one world that the opinions are more important or what others thinks about you, are more important because the constantly opinions from people that the only things they care about is their appearances, one of the first reason why is a biggest accomplishment try to be yourself and be individuality is that you need to appear how you are, do your own stuff, no matter what the opinions are.

I am agree with the author of this prompt because is true that is a biggest accomplishment that everyday we have to tried to completed and do not do what others want you to do to make them feel better, or just do it for appear something that you are not, is good to be individuality and do your things by yourself and do not get influence with bad comments or opinions from others that are not satisficate with their personalities but is not easier to be strong in the world where the appearances has a big influences in the community.

In Conclusion, not everything is easy, when people do not try to let the stereotypes when is talking about how to be yourself, and leave others decided for you or left them influences you with negative thoughts, those people are not better enough to stay in your life, is a greatest accomplishment to dissolve but nothing is impossible and believe in yourself individuality and do the rights things can help you to finish the thoughts about others people with try to change everything.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0

DA6899CADE97,"The British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Although many people believes that Churchill's statement is wrong, I believe in the important role that failure plays in people's lives to be successful in the future. In fact of the society, failure is a bad experience, however, I believe that failure is a way to help people to grow in personally, to be more successfully, and teaches you how to be mannerly.

Every single day, we are exposed to a reality that can be favorable or unfortunate. Where people need to learned about their failures, and grow personally from their new experiences. They made you more mature. That can be the example of my aunt, a nice woman who had an accident in the past. She was traumatized after that accident, but that never stop her to receive professional help with enthusiasm and do what she likes to do, helps others. My aunt understood that everything is possible if we do not loss our enthusiasm, and our pleasure to be success.

Life treat of deal with all unexpected situations. Failures that people never thought that could happen to them. However, everything depends on your enthusiasm, if you want to stay in the same place or learned about your failure and keep going until you accomplish your dreams. Generic_Name, a friend, is an example of the statement just mentioned. Generic_Name wanted to pass his classes in order to graduate. Generic_Name's teachers always told him that he was wasting his time if he was planning to go to the university, but Generic_Name never loss his hopes. Generic_Name became more expert in every subject, he graduated. Moreover, he demonstrated that everybody could be successful, if they try their best.

Everything has two faces, like a coin. As failures can be bad experiences, they can also be helpful if we look at them with good eyes, and if we receive them with good manners. People need to realize that the way in which a thing is happening is not bad at all. Things happens to foment our self and made us more mature. An example of this can be all of us. When we are passing for a bad moment we need to control our behavior, take a rest and think in a positive way to be successful.

In conclusion, Churchill's statement is more than right. Do not pay to much attention to the different failures and keep going with enthusiasm, is the key to be successful in life. Accomplish a dream that we are fighting for, is the best that could happen to everybody. That is why we do not need to discourage and loss our enthusiasm just for a failure that happened to us.

There's more reasons but those are my reasons.

When you go to school you learn. The longer you stay the more you learn more . The more you learn the easier it is to get in collage . Collage looks at people who learn a lot so the after school program is gonna make them have a better future. Learn more and youll have a better career.

When you get tough new stuff it can be fun to learn about the new stuff your learning about . So when you learn new stuff you can be ahead of your class. Learning new stuff can make you twenty percent smarter than you usually are. Learning new stuff can get you a better job in the future.

There's always time to learn new stuff .

By going to a after school program you can study for quiz and test. If you get a good grade on mostly all your test then your gonna have good grades and thats a fact. quizzes are mini test so you should also try to pass them because both are huge deals. Passing test can bring your grade from a F to a C+. Passing quizzes can bring your grade from a F to a D+. So they bring you from a failing grade to a passing grade.

DBCAB09E41C7,"This is a good idea, and the educators should be agree with this. Summer Break should be more longer. We fell the summer is not enough time for us to enjoy the vacations. We need more weeks to rest and enjoy the beach and many things. I am agree with this people who think that the summer should be four weeks of break, and a long winter break. because during the vacation, we go to the beach, work, play with friends and family, visit friends or family that live far away or in other state, and sleep more. I think idea is great. Because during the period of the school we do not have time to go out. We only do homework, projects and many others things, and that is the reason that I like this idea because is the best way to enjoy the summer and have more time to rest. Winter should be more longer because during this season is very cold and dangerous, I think winter break should be more longer.

Because Winter is a beautiful season of the year, but it is also a problem because during this period of the year, if people who drive do not take precaution they would have serious problems, and I think the school should be closed during this period, because the buses can slide on the ice, and can cause a big accident, and this is a risk, because many people can die. The educators should know this and think about. Because this is seriously, we have to be more careful during winter, many students come to school, buses drive over the snow, and this is a risk, I think this is a great idea why winter should be more longer, and more weeks of vacation, this days of snow should be make up on the spring. I think this is the reason why people think the Winter Break should be more longer because they know what can happen. They know the dangerous the snow it is, we all know that is beautiful, but can be very painful. This should be note by the educators and think the days or weeks break that they want to give to the students.

In conclusion the educators should be agree with this idea, and think that we more weeks to rest and enjoy the summer. During winter take precautions because can be really dangerous, and we would have more time to do many things at home or might be work, and have more time with the family.

DBE977177080,"Have you ever found something on the ground and picked it up and pretended that is was yours.

That right there is called a lie and its really bad because you dont know if that money you found or that toy you found was somebod's when they come back to look for it its gone because somebody else just walked away with there stuff that they spent there money on. When I was a kid I would always see this stuff, people would drop there stuff and I would pick it up and give it back to them or tell them they dropped it and hand it over to them. Usually when people find stuff just laying around the first thing to come to mind is take it but that isnt very smart because you never know whos it is or where it came from, and taking if its not your is stealing. Many people say leave it where you found it because people will comeback looking for there stuff, because nobody leaves there stuff somewhere and then just walks away with out knowing or caring. I know many schools teach this because when I was at my elementary school there would always be signs all over the place talking about leave it where you found it and dont take whats not yours, many kids listened to that in my school but sometimes people just dont care and thats not okay because they might not even need it and just want it. Needing it is like you have to have something or its really important to you and if you dont have it you would have to struggle to find, but if you really need something then I am pretty sure you can buy it from any nearby stores. Wanting something is like you dont have to have it but you just want it to brag or to have fun with it or you just dont really care and dont need it but just want to take something that you can buy, even though your not struggling or going through any trouble you just felt like doing the action you did and dont really care.

If you find something dont take it

If you see somebody drop something give it back to them

Be aware of your actions

Dont listen to pear pressure

Be helpful

Be kind

This lesson is very important because many people now dont do this stuff and just take and many parent dont really care anymore so thats when the school has to step in and teach the young kids whats wrong and whats right. When somebody drops something always hand it back why you say, because if you drop something and you think you lost it and it was your favorite toy or a toy that you spent your money on and really liked it, what if somebody just saw it and took it how would you feel, probably mad, sad,upset, you would be very upset because your favorite toy is gone and you cant get it back because the person that took it does not really care and didnt need it but just wanted it or took it because there was nobody there. Now imagine you drop your favorite toy and somebody saw you drop it and ran up to you to give it back to you how would you feel, probably happy, proud, delighted, because that person gave it back and didnt have any intentions with it or didnt think about even taking it they just wanted to give it back because they are not the owners of the item that was found on the ground but the owner that dropped it is right in front of them, the owner of the item could of just walked away and never realized they dropped it until they needed to use it for something. I lost my iPad years ago because the person that saw it took it and didnt really care do I know who it is no because I never payed attention to who took it I just was really happy and didnt realize what they were gonna do, and didnt think of this stuff happening to me when it did happen I was very upset and had to use my moms phone until my dad would buy me a phone. Thats why this lesson is very important to show kids that taking something that isnt yours is not smart or needed, many people dont care but when it happens to them they care and ask there self why did this happen to me is because you didnt leave what you took where it was found so the person that saw the item you own they did the same thing you just did, they took it and you will probably never see it again. Many items are very expensive like phones people love there phones and can never get off it and when somebody cracks there phone they go nuts and get mad because that crack can make your phone glitch or tweak, but if somebody lost there phone I already know that they would be so mad because nowadays phones are over $1,000 and they can be more expensive then that so when they lose there phone and find out somebody took it they wouldnt be very happy and probably go every where to look for it and would do anything to get it back, because phones are so important to people and sometimes they need it for calling somebody to pick them up or they would be stuck at a place for a long time or to call for help if somebody needs it. If somebody stole my phone I would get very angry and sad because the item I just lost and somebody picked it up or stole it is very expensive and isnt easy to buy because new phones are like the cost of a used car that you can buy from the internet.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
DC467256CD82,"Technology, 21st centuries finest product. nearly everyone loves technology, is it really that beautiful? When i was a kid people used to say ""technology will end our social life."" I didnt believe that then, but now i see what they were trying to say.

Primarily technology's goal is to make certain tasks easier, not to make us anti-social or make us obese. In my opinion technology has a great potential, and we are not using it to the full potential, we are supposed to use it to make simple task easier, but people are spoiling this potential by instead of making our own food we now order it from a restaurant which is ten times unhealthier. Another thing that is a huge problem is people building their life around technology, if they lose that technology they think they'll die. Everyone uses social apps on their phone, and that's a huge issue because that is one of the main reasons of people choosing social media over having conversations face to face.

Secondly, technology has it's pros as it has it's cons. One of the main advantages of technology is minimizing the waste of time in simple daily life tasks. For example, before technology people used to communicate with mails which took a long time to arrive at the designated place, however currently you can shorten that whole process to only a minute or two. Also with technology we can make waste free houses, cars, planes, and many other things by making them operate with electricity rather than fossil fuels which harms our planet. We can harvest electrical energy by solar panels, wind turbines, hydroelectric turbines. Another great thing about harvesting electrical energy is that they are infinite unless a disaster happens and suddenly all our water vaporizes or the sun gets blocked or the wind stops blowing. Until disasters like those happens we are good to go with waste free energy.

Third of all I think that technology is a great invention for the human kind. Although it has multiple harmful effects for people, the way to cure those are as easy. If we stop building our life around social media or technology, and keep technology as just a secondary communication device. Technology has come a far way from where it started. Once it was used just to power a light bulb, now its used to power our cars, houses, phones, cities, everything you see that is human built has some sort of technology in it.

Finally all these great inventions, all of these dazzling things took our attention and isolated us from the others. I think that technology is a brilliant invention but also it is a very harmful one for our social life. Human is a social creature by it's nature, if something blocks the socializing part of being human it will end badly. If someone tries to change a creature's nature it will try to avoid it, for thousands of years it has evolved to its current state, and now we are trying to change it... All Im trying to point out is technology is a beneficial element of our life but social-life is not one of them.                                                  ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5
DCB1A6F255A8,"Technology is something many people use in their daily lives, I belive technology has definintly made an imppact on people over time. Phones, cell phones, laptops, tv's have all been upgrated during the past couple of years, technology can effect us in both negative and positive ways but i belive that their are more negative's than positive's.

One reason I belive technology has more of a negative impact is because it causes a lack of communication with friends and with family, I myself have witnessed and expirinced this. Another reason in why it would be negative is the children using technology. Children can become more obsesed with electronnics than most teenagers and adults, I have a little brother that recived an ipad as a gift from my parents whe he was only three years old, only because he would'nt let my mother use her cell phone in peace, getting that ipad might have been the biggest mistake thats my parents could have made. My little brother (when he recived the Ipad) stopped playing with his toys, stopped watching his favorite show which was spongbob, stopped eating as much and also stopped listening to direction and became rebelious. Everytime one of the members in my family would try to talk to him it would be like he was zonned out; he just would not listen. Another negative impact this was would be that my little brother would yell when someone tried taking his Ipad away and thats when my parents knew it was a very huge problem, so they decided to put his Ipad away for a while as well as our electronics or atleast keep them out of his sight and over time I got my little brother back and my parents got their son back.

Secondly, technology can distract people in many negative ways, one way is safey, you could be walking, driving, on a boat it does not matter, but if you're on your phone and not aware of your surrounding, or not paying mind to them, than you could get hurt. Their have been many reports on people getting in car accident or getting hit all because they were not paying attention, but overall their have been more incidents while driving.

There are some ways that technology has also been benefial to us. Some ways that technology has been beneficial is if you work in a job that requires you to have a computer or laptop to make work easier, or having a busy work schedule that you can type into your phone and it would alert you about the things you have to get done. Another benefial way that technology has helped is shopping! eveybody loves shopping but somtimes you can't go out and do some shopping for yourself becuse maybe its been a long week and your exausted from work or you're injured, as well as having children. Children are the worst when it comes to doing things for yourself, which is why there is technology to help you out, you can do online shopping for grocieries, clothing, exc without having to leave the comfort of your own home.

In conclusion, technology overall has its ups and down, there are times where it can be beneficial and there are also times where it can be a distraction but it has definetly helped in the past in many ways one really big one is hospitals, technology has saved many lives and helped alot of familys so it really depends how you use technology for it to actually be benefitial. It's not good to take advantage of it, you have to use your brain as much as you can, people depend on technology too much and that's what causes problems.        ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5
DCF9F70FBA91,"Do you think we choose our own character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control? I believe that we choose our own character. I don't think that our character is formed by influences. Our character is what we make out of it. Some of the reasons why I think we choose our own character is because of the way we are, the way we treat people, and the way we tell ourselves to be.

One of the reasons why I think we choose our own character is because of the way we are. The way we are tells people about ourselves a lot. It describes who we are. For example some people who know my sisters and I so well say that we're all so different. That's because we are all our own character. Some siblings look up one another so it makes them wanna be like their older sister so , they don't get to make their own character.

Another reason is the way we treat people. The way we treat people is part of our character. It helps other people see the way you are. They judge you to see if you're nice or mean. Also what you hear about yourself makes you wanna act different.

The last reason is the way you choose to be. You get to pick who you wanna be. Although some people say that your character is already formed by influences. They may have a point because they say that it's how your family is. If your family taught you to be a certain way then you would grow up being that way because that's the way you grew up, but at the end of they day you are you. your family might've taught you to be a certain way but you can always change how you wanna be.

In conclusion, I believe that we choose our own character. I don't think that our character is formed by influences. Our character is what we make out of it. Some of the reasons why I think we choose our own character is because of the way we are, the way we treat people, and the way we tell ourselves to be. We are our own character.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0
DD00E48BC258,"Honestly, I do not agree about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. The pursuit of success in life is achieving it in many ways.. Therefore, you can push yourself to be successful by putting in effort.. Failure can lead to serious conflict because then you will not be able to succeed. The important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success is not agreeable because you can overcome obstacles, aiming the goal to success, and to achieve the plan to .success.

First reason, is to overcome the obstacles, for that you must have to work hard. Also, it takes practice the better you get to succeed. Do not give up on something you are overcoming in life. One of the biggest problems that people have in life is not overcoming what they are afraid of and from being afraid will not get you to succeed. Most of all to overcome the obstacles. is to try them not to give up on them.

Second reason, putting a great effort can lead to improving. Efficiently the work you do can increase a great impact towards your achievements. In order to achieve a method, working pays off and by earning it. For example, people push themselves to making progress. Others might work hard in different ways to be successful and to aim what they want. Eventually, when making progress towards something, can influence the goal your improving.

Third reason, to plan the success is to try achieving what your aiming for. In other words, enthusiasm can be those people that want to be successful in life. Pursuit also aims for the goal your trying to influence. When planning goals, is the most valuable thing to achieve. There must always be a plan towards the target you aim. Majority of the people, look for something easy they can achieve in their future goal and that is how they succeed.

Finally, the key to being successful in life is by achieving it. To be honest, I do not agree about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of improving. Many people find success by putting in effort and time towards big things. It is not to late to start pushing yourself to be successful and being something in life. Therefore, is it not an important role that failure plays in pursuit of success, and to achieve the plan to succeed ",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.5

Tell yourself to always think positive never negative you should have enthusiasm because that is what makes you stronger. Who you are is how you make of it and having interest on new things makes you a believer in yourself.

While John Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" Our character traits is based on how we choose it to be. We should choose our Character traits by the way we know our self's best, Other people opinions could be wrong on what they might tell us, Character traits shows how our personality is really like.

Knowing our self better then many people are can build character alive it shows how much strength we have. By the way we represent our self best and what all of this can build out of it also shows how much knowledge it bring as well. Having many traits and how well we can identify about them shows us and others how best we know our self and how well we can put a label on it. showing many different types of traits on an everyday life style isnt easy nor impossible. It takes time to realize what kind of character trait you are trying to build. by digging deep and finding many different types of personalities in yourself will build a strong trait you may never knew about.

Asking for other peoples opinion about who or what character do you bring out upon yourself might give you wrong information. Maybe asking a friend could bring ideas to build a good character trait but might not give enough information. Finding about your own character traits is difficult. There can be many different types of option instead of asking for someone else opinion. Online could be a strong benefit about finding more information about your character traits.

DE3867FD43DE,"well hello today I will discust the diferent between working wit a group or working alone first let me ask you a question how hyou like to? with a group or alone? well i chose working with a group lets see why...

working in group and working alone have advantages and disavantages for each one,I like wirking as a group because your team can help you with some ideas and ways to do your work and at the same time have fun while your are doing the work. disavantages in a group there will be always a person that want to be just playing around and don't like to do any type of work just have fun. nut if we being on the side of be working alone thant advantage will be that you will have more oportunity of do your work the way you want to and no be worry about other people opinion. you will finish your work faster and the way you want the wor kto be done,but some disvantages you will no have fun because you have no one to be with and it will be difficult to have a lot of ideas. i think working with a group is more beneficial because if you think there will be more people at the ppresentation helping you and you will feel more secure with your work.

working with a group can help you to increase your skill level of talking and self confidence and being social(meet new friends) , working alone can sometimes can get borring and you dont finish the work because you don't have someone to share the ideas with,

workingt alone can cause you a damage on yuor personalty and your aparetion people will think i he don't like workign with aother person around that he should work by it self andf then there will be a lot of caos that person fall in depresion because no one acept him and it was because you make them to be like that or feel that way.

while you are working with a group you learn skilll like having respect for others and diferentsd way of doing things and work as a team,or even for example you love play sport well you can not do it by your self because there will be team, and how you will work as a team with out learning how to work as a group, you need to learn how to work as a team if you want to be succesful in the comunity, in your future working with a group with the perople you trust you learn that friendship is alway good for you have thar confident that people you like being with help you to increase on your life that is a feel that no one can easy aford it.

went oyu are working with a group friendship will always be there why because is the keey of being succesful on your life. in your future, and your career, in your job.

for example;

lets said that you was driving on the higway driving normal but you forgot to past by the gas station you are in the middle of the street you don't have gas well if you don't like to work with a group then you will push your car and problably you will end up getting a desease or crashing another car.

while if you learn how to work as a group then you can have four people helping you push your car others stop the traffic and some calling the police to help you with that issue.

now you see why it is importan to learn and work as a group, even though with that you already meet new people and have new friend,what I try to said is that working with a group help you a lot in harders things that you need help with.

working alone is depent of what kind of personality you have and if you love working with out people than is fine but there will alway a time that you have to work as a team or group becasue there are things that someone by them self can not accomplish.

when you work as a group you gain respect and great friend ship because if you help with everything then everyone will love working with you and you now will feel that you are important and useful, something that working alone it will be dificult to make.

well i hope you like my explanation i did my best and i feel that we should be more socialize with other nad let then join us for our better future so they can have friends and they never feel like their are alone, lets make everyone happy and having a good time helping other and always respectful.",2.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0
DE921CECE21A,"Do we accomplish more by constantly doing something? Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" He believed that more would be accomplished if there was something being done most of the time, I agree with this. Accomplishing a task motivates some people to do more, accomplishing more, It also helps us learn more about ourselves. Although, people believe that being in-active is better because it provides less stress and more free time, It also keeps us from succeeding our daily tasks and influences us to be lazy.

Being busy would require us to be awake and alert of what we are doing. In some cases, after finishing up a task, all people want to do is move on and rest. In other cases, people choose to knock out more work that they have in mind. Having this kind of mindset it good, because it allows a person to have more energy and to keep themselves busy. A personal experience would be when I was so tired one afternoon, but I had to keep myself from napping because I had homework due. After I completed that one homework, I was too awake to even sleep; So I decided to knock out other work I had in the meantime. In the end I received a better grade from that class and I had chores finished from that week so I didn't have to do anything in the weekend. To conclude this paragraph, when I accomplished one thing I ended up accomplishing more than I expected.

We all have our different ways of living and learning. One way to help you learn more about yourself is by keeping busy. You learn how to manage your own time, you learn about how you react to a hectic environment which can help for future references, and You learn how your own mind works. For example, When I was in my sister's sixteenth birthday party, I also had school to focus on, homework to get done, and Sol's to focus on. For me it was a pretty hectic schedule, but I learned how to respond and manage my time. Learning how to manage my time came in handy when my sixteenth birthday came along. Everyone has a different way of living and learning, and keeping myself busy taught me a lot about how I live and learn.

Although being in active provides us with less stress and more free time, which is not always a bad thing, It influences us to not only be more lazy, but to procrastinate. To procrastinate put off something that should be done, To leave it for that moment and do it later, as you repeatedly tell yourself, but you occasionally never end up doing it. Procrastination can lead you to become more and more unprepared. Being unprepared isn't the best way to live. Having more free time can have it's positive outcomes, but also its negatives. For example, who wants to accomplish nothing now, only to do the same in the future? People may believe being in-active is a better way to live because it relieves you from stress and work, but doing nothing can follow with other bad habits that can lead to worse in your future.

In conclusion, we accomplish more by keeping busy. Keeping ourselves busy can help us prepare for our future, and help us learn more about ourselves and how to respond to a hectic lifestyle. Although some people would like to live a lifestyle doing absolutely nothing, that wouldn't be the case for all. Others would prefer to accomplish more by staying active and helping themselves prepare for whatever comes next.                     ",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

Do you think that it would help the students with their homework or that its just a waste of time to do this type of clubs. Some people might think that the homework club its helpful and others don't. Others might do it just to get their homework done early. That way they have free time at home to play games or to go out with friends.

I think that this club can help so many students who have difficulty with certain subjects like Math, English, or Science. It can also help them get their homework done or any projects that they didn't finish in class. The teachers there can help the students with their work. Also they can work with a friend that is in the club with them. It would be a really fun thing because you get everything done faster.

Some people might think that its a waste of time because they can do their homework at home. Other students just go to get all their homework done early. They can also go to have a little fun with their friends after they are done with all their work that they had. This club can also help you study for a test that you're about to take or something else. They can also just go to play video games if they have no homework to do.

I think that the schools should keep doing this club after school because it can help students get their homework done. That way the students can improve their grades that they have in the class. The students should also not be misbehaving while in the club. They shouldn't do any inappropriate things or say anything inappropriate during the afterschool club. If they do they should get a consequence.

Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.'Do we choose our own character traits ,or is our character formed by influences beyond our control.

Although some people think that character is formed for other persons that are around them and that their character is always going to be formed for people around them but character is formed by the way of your own emotions that shows how you feel how you are, other people says that if they don't be like other people want to they be they feel out of the group in that moment some people starts to hate their self, but what other people do is they ignore what people says about them as they don't hear anything and never give up.

Other people think that if they don't change their character they are going to success in their life and that they are obligate to change for they future and when they change they start to feel bad because they change something better than what they get and when other people ask them for what they change they says that for be an adult they have to be like one but what is a adult is a is a person that looks death and is always mad with other people or they say that the character is formed from the moment they born and that hey can not do anything about it .

E0656353B8F2,"School districts shouldn't give the three year instead of four year program. Why? because students should receive all the education they need to succeed everything they want with completing four years of high school. Most colleges look for students that have completed four years of their high school education, also they don't like when students have free periods unless they have a specific reason of requesting free courses. Students will always have time to do what are they want in life with a four year high diploma it doesn't matter if your birthday is late and you want to graduate with three years because you don't wanna graduate at that specific age. Teachers, parents,siblings, they should be the ones telling they're children or young adult that it is important to complete there four years of high school. The process you have to follow to do a three year of high school is more stressful because you have to summer school or evening school where there are not really a lot of teachers to help out with most of the stuff you need help with. When your in school you have English, history, science, mathematics teachers, you have counselors librarians everyone that can help you with anything you need to finish high school. Most students may graduate early because they have an illness, disease, or something and they just can't take the pressure of being in school no more. From my point of view parents should always talk to there children about how important education is for them they can pursue all there dreams if the parent didn't have the opportunity to finish there high school career. Also entering college early wouldn't be so convenient because maybe the student missed something they didn't learn then when they get to college there like my teacher didn't teach me this or I don't know what that is. The work force accepts a lot of young teenage children that graduate from high school and expect them to have a high school diploma and of course they'll have a high school diploma but they wont know how many years they completed which I believe still shouldn't be accepted. Children think that just because they have a high school diploma they're better then everyone else if you only completed three years you shouldn't feel superior to everyone else. I would feel disappointed in myself for not completing all the four years I needed because I would feel like I didn't complete everything I need to be the most intelligent most outgoing person I am. If your a child that believes you can't do it and finish high school because it's stressful, of course you can do it I punish myself all the time for saying that. I may not be the most smartest person in my family but i'm giving it my all to complete my high school career as an older sister and role model of two younger siblings that I have. Also if your a three year completer you should always take younger siblings in to consideration because they look up to you and they are gonna think that just by completing three years its OK. To be someone successful in life finish all four years of your high school education schools shouldn't provide three year programs for students or at the age of eighteen they can drop out they are going to get no job no one will accept them without an education. There is nothing good out in the world without an education or some type of proof that you have completed or have gone to school. In conclusion, to all of this children, teenagers, anyone take in mind that colleges, jobs, anything will most likely look for a four year completer because if they see you as a three year completer they'll take the other person instead of you. Even if you have all the requirements you needed to complete high school you still really didn't finish your career. Schools should stop providing this program and make students complete there four years in high school because it is very important for them to get an education till they are 18 and they are free to make their own decisions if they want to drop or just do three years of high school. And don't be the type of person to just finish high school with three years and do nothing after you have decided to not finish school you just decide to drop out to be home and do nothing for yourself. Be the bigger person and take full responsibility of your education because you only have yourself throughout your journey in high school there will be no friends once it comes down to your senior year in high school.

E07F7A913FB6,"A football manager OleGunnar Solksajer once said ""Prasing his players and kids helps them work to the best of their ability"". That is a very significant statement because every student have their own set of skills and abilities. Some students are good in sports,math,science,art or music. However, plenty of students are not able to perform to the best of their ability because they have low self-confidence which is mainly caused by the lack of praise and incentive by their parents,teachers or coaches. Praising a student's work is important because it helps build their confidence and motivates them to work harder.

Praising a student's work is vital for their productivity because it builds their confidence. Studies show that people with high self-confidence are usually risk takers,creative,optimistic,hardworking and productive. This shows how important it is for teachers and parents to praise their students. Self-confidence is not something that happens suddenly, it is a process that builds up from a young age. Little praises and incentives from parents and teachers are not only important for the students' performance in school but also when they transform into adults.

Additionally, another importance of praising students is the motivation for them to work harder. Students always seem to work harder when they get an incentive or praise. That is because students feel appreciated for their work and it also make them feel like they are doing a good job so they always stay motivated to do better every time. Motivation is vital for everyone because its as important as an oil is for a car. Motivation is a motor that keeps the sudents happy and hopeful. Motivated students always work hard and give their best effort.

There are some people that think praising students will undrmine learning by lowering standards and some believe a true self-esteem and confidence comes from achievment and not from prasing. Although it's a fair opinion, it is wrong because students who get praise from teachers and parents always seem to do better acadamically and in outside-school activities. In conclusion, Praising a student's work is very important because it helps build their confidence and motivates them to work harder and smarter.",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0
E0BDF62838F7,Hey have you been asked to teach a group of elementary students a lesson? well you have been chosen to teach a group of students a lesson and the lesson was multiplying and dividing because it will teach how add and subtract quickly. The 1st example is like going to a grocery store and don't know how much does 4 bags of chips cost for the party your going to well multiplying can help you figure out the cost. The 2nd example for dividing can help you figure out if you have a discount you can find the new cost and how much money you saved. Final reason is like multiplying and dividing fractions like 1/2 times 2/3 that would equal 2/6 and dividing that by 1/2 will equal 2/3 because if you add that is would be 3/5 and subtracting that by 1/3 would be 2/2 which is 1. So in conclusion multiplying and dividing can help you get answer more fast than adding and subtracting over and over.,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0
E0ED97D6F88B,"Dear principal ,As a student i think we should balance The school menu of healththeir school lunches is a good idea and also a bad idea, the resaon why is when most students don't take care of their own body by eating junk food but most student like their favorite food for example, most students in my class when they eat their favorite food for example pizza, in lunch it will affect their stomach but not only their stomach but they have nothing health besides milk to eat.

My second reason is when you eat health on school days your body will feel better and relax and also when you eat healthier foods your body can help you in the future as you grow older health foods in school would be a great way for students not to be sick and they need protein to grow.

My thrid reason is if you take away our favorite food most students wont eat the healtheir food, remember when their was no Fried Chicken friday at lunch and thats like everyones favorite food the school was so upset they didnt eat lunch for the day over chicken. So in conclusion I think that we should balance them out like their should days were we eat health foods and days we can eat favortite foods.

When the food is Balance students will be able be more happy if they just have both their favorrite foods and something Health to eat, so in my opinon i really hope you make students have both their favorrite foods and healtheir foods so that all students would be happy and so as their body.

E11139259D4E,"Students have enough hours of school already! I strongly disagree about the school board adding more hours to school every day. I'm not telling you this just because I'm a student, I'm telling you this because It doesn't just affect me, It affects other students in many ways too! This could bring students really bad behaviors, because they get tired of being in the same place for a long period of time. This could bring students grades down too, because students do not work the same when they are tired. If they added more hours to school, students wouldn't have time to do their homework or to study for quizzes and tests.

This idea of adding hours to school does not just affect students, it brings problems to the teachers and the school. Teachers have families and some of them have children of their own, this wouldn't let teachers to go home and pass time with their family. Another problem I see in this It's that some students have appointments, Just like me !

Sometimes I have to go to my orthodontist, and my appointments are always in the morning, I have to go there every month. I always miss two or three classes, and when I get there I have A bunch of work that I missed! If they din't add those hours to school I could ask my orthodontist to do my appointments in the afternoon. Sometimes students get sick, and if they miss one day of school they would have to do more work than the usual. This affects the school in many ways too! The school would have to pay more, because they would have to give the students more food than the usual. They would have to waste more money in paper, bathroom supplies and they would have to give the student a new agenda with more bathroom passes in it. the school would have to manage more conflicts and fights between the students. If they added one and a half hours to school they would create more car crashes and accidents in the roads, because the students would get out of school at the same time that elementary school students do, and then there would be a lot of school buses.

Students wake up pretty early, at least that's what I do. If the school added more hours they would get more than tired, the student wouldn't even learn the lessons or the teacher wouldn't even teach the lessons right. As you can see I listed many ways that adding hours to school affects students,teachers and the school. I think the school board should rethink this new idea they came up with. i think that they should hear other students points of view. I think I'm not the only student that thinks that this is not a good idea because it affects everyone. And some other students think different from others.

In conclusion I think that the school board shouldn't add more hours of school because of the different consequences it gives to the students, teachers and the school. And it not just gets the students tired but they wouldn't learn the subjects like they normally do in class. Teachers are affected by this decision too, because they get more tired and they get mad at students easier. This could create big conflicts between people in school and it could bring the school more problems than the usual, like more fights and they would have to give students more breaks. So please School board, rethink this idea you came up with and hear other peoples points of view!!!.

That's why there is a saying teat people the way you want to be treated. Therefor you will get the same amount of respect that you put out there toward other people

Firstly, I do believe that positive attitude is the key to success in life. Having all this positively and good energy will get you along way in life. Why you might ask your self. Having good positive energy will allow you to meet new people and they might want to interact with you for having good energy surrounding.

Secondly, this may allow you to meet new people. Meaning they might would like to share with you on how they found the key to success. After that you would probably would like to share the key to your success, and how it helped you accomplish your goals that you might have thought that you never would.

Thirdly, this may lead you to the success in life that you have been dreaming about. That being millionaire or stepping up in your woke place etc. Being joyful and happy in life will allow you to accomplish and allow you to work 100 percent good.

Lastly, all I have to say is that positive attitude is the key to success in life. The only reason I say this is,because I was one of those students that didn't interact with anyone because of my attitude. Now that I have learn and taught my self to be the person who I am today I have made so many friends that I didn't know I would talk.

Sense technology has improved through out the 20th centuries people argue that technology has caused limitations on human contact but that is far from being right. People have been brought closer thanks to the invention of the internet and it wouldn't have happened if technology wasn't improved. The internet has opened a whole new world of opportunities and awesome people to meet. People can laugh at a funny mems together and create groups where their you can talk about what ever you want. People can even ask others if they would like to be friends with you. Having the internet,people become more confident in being their true self. People can see how much fun a family is having and it can persuade them to go and try the place and experience the fun for themselves.

With technology people have learned how to do things by watching videos of someone else doing it or by calling a friend. Video games have also has let to people having to talk on the mic and being able to comunicate with each other. People can also build their sense of being a leader as they play a game they can ask people to saty with each other. Thanks to technology people can have online teachers and people who would do online courses say for instance if you didnt learn a lesson you can go online and find a somone who would eplain to you or tell you how to solve a problem.

think high school offer those programs to young students that wants to graduate in early age and other students take this programs, because they want to graduate to continue with college or work to help their families. In other cases students just took these courses because they don't likes school .

But however their are always students that decide to complete high school in four years to have full credits to go at the best colleges. These students that take high school in four years are more prepared to colleges and they have more probabilities to get a better job.

For me take school in three years is a bad choice, because you learn a few less.

Examples:If you take school in three years and if you don't have the result that you wanted than you are gonna think that was a bad choice in your life.

Conclusion: students would take the traditional four years of school and enjoy the young age at school. Than after the four regular years, It's time to think about what they want to do with life work or continue with college.    ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5
E25FE9E05F36,"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. There is a lot of benefits of having a positive attitude which are health or physical improvements, how to solve a problem, and the power that exists inside you.

The benefits of optimism extend beyond stress relief better health, more rewarding relationships and enhanced productivity. People with a positive outlook tend to experience are reduced incidence of depression, lower stress levels and are better able to cope with stress causing events, an incresed life span and overall better health. People with a positive outlook on life are also more likely to live healthier lifestyle, and to smoke cigarattes less and drink less alcohol.

Attitude is the way taht we behave and we react to the daily activities, consequently a positive attitude may influence our life and it aspects in a deep way such as how we think, socialize, and even how our health is. All these aspects might be affected by a positive attitude. Actually it is proved that successful people have been influenced by the way they see the circumtances in their life. In other words, successful people see those circumtances with a positive attitude and they see those circumtances as a challange to beat and not like a punishment to suffer. Therefore, these people will be more likely to fight and have success in their life, rather than the ones who see their life as a punishment. Positive attitude might be the key to all the people who want to fulfill their dreams. If everyone would apply these concepts in their lives, they would become happier because they will see that everything including their life, situations, and problems, is under their own control.

Even though there are some people who wonder how to get a good positive attitude, is not simple to get it. Almost every single person that has has a positive attitude is because tehy have had a motivation or a feeling that supports their fight to reach their goal or achievement. When you have a positive attitude, you feel that there is a power inside of you that motivates you to do something or to get involved with something. These people are most commons to have best attitudes of this world.

E2F767441B44,"If in high school should young students be capable of committing to a career. Some adults say that young students should pick a career. Others say that they are not ready to choose and commit to a career. I believe that students should commit to a career at a young age. The age shouldn't determined how committed you can be to a career. Being young shows a lot of both positive and negative benefits.

Early experience for these students can benefit future jobs. For example, you take a class for cooking and seek for a job you will have a better chance then those who have no experience. Starting your career with prior knowledge before becoming an adult will make it easier to obtain a job once you graduate high school. Those who choose to wait after high school will have a harder time seeking a job. Your chances for a job are much higher then those without any experience.

Making less mistakes because of all the prior knowledge you learned beforehand. For example, you take a class for cooking and you start learning early how to stop from burning your food. So, when you start cooking at a restaurant you will know how to stop from ruining the food. Starting young will prevent less mistakes from happening in your future job. This gives the students a better resume if they know what they are capable of doing and doesn't need to be taught. Having less mistakes during the job will show your bosses that you know what you are doing for them.

The students will have some confidence before going into their career. For example, you learn about the kitchen and what everything does so when you go in you won't expect anything new. This will help students have some confidence since they know what to expect going into they're career. Before entering a career it's good that students can relax and feel better since they know how everything will go. A boost of confidence is what students need before going into something.

On the other hand, people say that having students commit to career in high school is a bad idea. For example, students are constantly changing there mind and changing there interests. Some adults say they are to young to commit to a career because of how uncertain they are when they make decisions. So, they think how can a student choose something for the rest of there life if they can't decide on some of the most simplest decisions. Those adults think that students should wait until they are older to make that type of decision.

Having students start early come with so many benefits for there future. They get to learn more in advance then the rest. Also they have better oppurtunites and better chances with getting there perfered career. That many positive outcomes will come out of starting early. So, I believe that students can commit to a career at a young age in high school.      ",5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0
E433745B3F87,"Michelangelo the artist once said,

'' The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving mark.'' I agree with michelangelo statement because we want to aim our goal right, or we will ending up missing. However, there can be a better statement to explain this more. When people want to achieve their goal to be somone in life. It's like shotting a arrow to hit the middle, and aiming the goal we want. For example, to aim it at the middle you have to focus, believe, think, be positive, and let go of your arrow to aim your goal. Other people would like a better statement , and also a better example to go with it. There are mostly people that take it serious to aim for their goal to be success. However there are some other that don't really care and just try to aim for their goal, and ending up missing their shot towards the middle. Another example, is when people want to aim their goal they have to study , work hard, have faith, believe , take risk , be proud, and never giving up. But there's people that miss their one shot towards the middle. Because they are lazy, not prepared, not focus, negative, not giving effort, and not paying attention for what goal their aiming for , so basically they will end up missing their only shot. Third example, is people have to aim their goal just right not to high , and to low. The goal is to aim in the middle ,but Micheangelo is right in one part because you only have one arrow to make it th the middle. It's mostly saying you have one shot to aim for your goal without making any miskates. I could understand why Michelangelo said '' The greater danger for most of us is aming our goal target right in one shot.'' Because there are some people that would have to take some risks. For example, they are not a citizen , or they don't have any papers to work , don't understand english well, they have to leave love ones behind,

and get discriminated by their colors. And it makes it more difficult for some people to aim for their goal. For those reasons theirs fewest people's that end up missing there shot. But there are other people's that won't let this get in their way by taking the risk , and some of those risks come worth it at the end. For example , there are some people that get discriminated by how they look and their color ,but doesn't mean that they have to give up ,and point their arrow the wrong direction to miss their shoot to success. They have to show the others people that they can make their one shot towards the middle all because they study, work hard, put effort, being prepared, being positive and never giving up. These are my supporting details ,and reasons why i agree with Michelangelo the artist statement. However, I don't think that this is statement is the most greatest danger for all of us.

For example,one of my experiences was meeting my whole family for the first time in my life, when we came to the united states my first impression was that i saw a lot of new things , a lot of nice cars , big houses , and a lot of people.

We stayed in texas for 2 days, we call my uncle the first day we stayed in texas, he told everyone in my family that we made it , we took different buses like for 3 days just to get to were my family was.

When we get there they went to pick us up , my first impression was to see all my family back again and that impression i will never forget it , and it will be never be change.

E545B850725F,"Although some say extracurricular activities are to enrich educational experiences many say otherwise. Students should definitely be involved in after school activities, whether if it's a sport or club, students will enjoy their time. Extracurricular activities could help a student get into collage. The student should be allowed to be apart of as many after school activities as they choose, they should first discusses with their families. The schools should not have the decision if students are in a activity or not based of if they will have time to do homework or study they should let the student make the decision and here's why.

The students should be allowed to be in as many activities as possible, while managing their time. The student will have to add the activity to their schedule, and know they will now be doing this on a daily basses or if not multiple times a week. The students family will be able to help the student out when in need of it. There will be time for homework and studying, because with a well put together schedule the student will go to school their choice of activity and go home and do their work. The student and their family should be in control of the management of school work and activities the school shouldnt be involved. When you know something works for you do not let anyone get in between what works for and what doesnt work. Students will have many opportunities in high school the extracurricular activities will just bring more and this is how.

Opportunities come and go in high school, but when a student is in a after school activity they will lots of opportunities. Collage could be one of those opportunities, collages like to see a student that is or was apart of a club or sport team. Athletes can get full ride scholarships to collage, when they can manage to do their school work and the activities it could help them in the future. A student managing their time can be difficult but with a well put together schedule can help them get to where they want to be. This is why schools shouldnt control student involvement in extracurricular activities but many have their opinions against this one.

Other say that the schools should have control over students and what activities the can do and however many they can do. The school wants the student to be able to have time to study and do homework but by doing that they will take away from the extracurricular activities students are in or want to be in. They say the school should have the power to be able to do this, the student and their families will not really have a say in the final decision. They say the school knows what is right for the student in making the decision on if they should be apart of a after school activity. The school wants the students to be able to do school work outside of school so they will want to take away from a club or sport so a student can have time to do the work.

The extracurricular activities should be in control of the students and their family, the school should not limit the amount of activities a student can do. The student should be in control in what they want to do if it's a cub or sport, they will have to make time to put this in their schedule and still have time to study and do homework. Doing this can help a student reach goals and they can enjoy their time while doing it. This is why the student should be in control of the activities they do.         ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5

Just one people can not make a good choice but more people can. People can choice their opinion for what thing can make then better. They can take ideas. If they talk only one that not a good advice. For a examples if you have a math problem and you use only one idea and that a hard one, use other choices that will help you. If you did not pick a idea it will be hard and you will fail.

E73CF852AC12,"Positive attitude is the key to be successful in life. Most of the time older people or somebody you don't really know they will tell you to give all your effort and think smart. By having a positive attitude people feel more happy and comfortable. For example,when they have a positive attitude people stars to give you some advises from the experiences they have been through. In life to have a positive attitude we have to know how to deal with our problems even tho sometimes we might think we can not do it but, there is always a solution and after all that has happened we learn how to have a smart thinking and not giving up.

Having a positive attitude makes people have a good communication with others. When having a conversation with another person you can learn more about anything. Sometimes the people who has good skills or positive attitude in their jobs or any other occupations they have the opportunity to earn a higher position in their job. For example,all managers have that position because they have showed that they can have a good attitude with themselves and other people. This gives them the chance to be a successful person in life and help to become as them.

Education is also a big influence and how a person can have a good attitude and good values. Life teaches people how to control their emotions and help those who need it. In life to become successful people needs to have a goal and a plan how they are going to accomplish that. I know sometimes we have many problems and we think it not possible to have a good attitude but, there is a way how to deal with bad attitude and always have in mind the goal we want to accomplish one day.

There is always people who is going to say negative things to others instead of give them advises. Also many people think they can not do it after they try the first time and did not happened how they expected. People has to keep in mind that not always everything will be easy to get and there will be obstacles in life that will make you feel that you can not get what you want. By thinking and having a positive attitude people can make it become true just don not give until you have reached your goal.

In conclusion,in my opinion having a positive attitude can make people become successful in life. Be some educated persons and listen to what others say to them. Many older people or family might not want to see you fail and that is the reason for those who keep a positive attitude so they will be proud of those who protrude in life.

E7EFD51B632F,"The most persuasive, efficient way to influence others takes someone to set a good example of their behavior. Those examples sets an image in people's minds of how they want to see themselves in an ideal state. Moreover, every single human being on this Earth has a certain vibe or energy they give off due to their actions and thinking that people perceive or take in to judge that person. When people see that someone else has an energy or vibe he/she likes or agrees with, he/she will tend to gravitate towards it. Setting a good example is the best way to influence others because people want to know what is morally right or wrong, to see change and improvement, and to take on similar motives.

The first reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people want to know what is morally right or wrong. Martin Luther King Jr. is demonstrated as a great example of influencing others about what is right and wrong by leading a protest that many African Americans were involved in. Martin Luther King Jr. gave a famous speech called ""

I Have A Dream

"" which radiated strong energy that gave African Americans the strength and pride to protest the whites' racist segregation laws. The great example set by Martin Luther King Jr. displayed that he was a capable and high-thinking individual that African Americans gravitated towards. Due to the fact that African Americans were influenced by Martin Luther King Jr., they were able to understand what their rights as a human being were and how wrong the whites' segregation laws was.

The second reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people want to see change and improvement within themselves. A personal trainer could be a figure for some people as they are persistent and passionate at what they do. This can lead people to being motivated at the gym and encouraged to become more fit and healthy. Also, It sets a postitive message in their mind saying they have what it takes to get to the point of where their personal trainer is. Having the personal trainer as a figure to gain motivation from led to a person seeing improvement and change in their body and mindset.

The final reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people desire to take on similar motives. At an early stage of development as a child, they tend to look up to their parents or popular figures in awe as they gain inspiration to become a certain profession. A child may have seen an astronaut on television and became inspired to become one when he/she grows up. This inspiration may have led this upcoming astronaut to take astronomy and other space-related classes. Then an amateur astronaut is born because the astronaut on TV decades ago set a good example on how interesting tasks an astronaut has to do which led to the inspiration.

In conclusion, people better themselves due to influence. Influencing others to know what is morally right or wrong, to see change and improvement, and to take on similar motives are all based on good examples that are set. The examples set must give off something that interests the other person to be able to connect with the person. Also, that person must retain an energy and vibe that coinsides with the other person for that person to be influenced. This is indeed the best way on influencing individuals.",5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.5
E80C88E9837C,"I agree with Churchill' statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of succes, because the way to become to the success is not gonna be easy. All the people that try to have a good success they gonna have failure on the way and sometime they fall apart, but they never have to loss their enthusianm, because the succes consists in fall apart and wake up again, and keep going looking for a good success that gonna be graet for their life and their family gonna be haughty of them.

I agree because, the life gonna put many impediment to have a good success we have to keep going do not have to loss aur enthusiasm, for example. My family came of a poor family, but I have an ancle that he never loss his enthusiasm of has a good success, so he worked too hard for it. One failure that he has on his way to the succes was the poorness, but he keep going wrestlering for get uot of the poorness and help his father and mother, one day he found a job and begin to meke money and his first thing that he made was to buy a bed for him, then he to begin to save money to come to this country, now he has a lot money in his bank account because he put his own company of landscaping, but he never loss his enthusiasm about his success.

I agree with this statement, because there is a lot example of how the people have many failure and they keep going never loss their enthusiasm of their success, one of this example is of one soccer player his name is Cristiano Ronaldo. He is a famous soccer player, but to have a great success he had many failure one of thase failure was that his father died when hi was a kid it was hard for him even has to see a psychologist and he to overcome that, he keep going looking for his success, but he failure again because the people and couche's that saw him, don't believe him they say like he doesn't has future, but he keep work in his success and show to all the people that don't believe him that they was wrong. Because he has a future and he gonna has a great success, now he is the best soccer player in the world for many people, but he always worked so hard to get out of the failure and he to obtain a good success.

I agree with Mister Churchill, because the way for a great success is gonna be long and we gonna have many filure to obtain this, for example. I am trying to graduate from high school, but one of failure was that it is not been easy for me, because this is a new language for me and it is dificult to talk, but I keeping going trying to get my diploma , another failure is that I have to work for pay may rent and buy my own stuff, shoes, clothes, and food, it make more dificult to have my success, but I know that success consists on fall apart and wake up, but I never loss my enthusiasm of to be graduate from high school. One day I gonna say that my success wasn't easy but I obtain a good success.

In Conclution I agree with ""churchill's statement about success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". I agree with him because on the way to a great success we gonna have many failure but we don'thave to loss our enthusiasm, because in the world there is a lot people that they never loss their enthusiasm, even when they have a failure they always weke up and keek going, now they have a good success, so if we want a great success in our life we have to keep going wrestlering with all the failure that we gonna have. One day we gonna say I made it and we gonna have a great success.

First, this activity has been done by everyone in the world. Which is dancing, everydody at least dances once in their lives. As we speak some people take this activity to the next level. Performing at competitions or shows people pay to watch. This activity is not only enjoyable but educational for those who seek interest in dancing. There are so many things you can learn froming dancing like tap, ballet, hip pop, jazz, and ballroom dancing and more.

Second, you express your emotion, all that anger and sadness you hide, you put that into your dance its what makes it special. Do what your body tells you to do, let out whatever it is your feeling, let your emotion tell a story. Its like writing a story in a book but the only thing different is that you are moving.

Third, dancing takes alot of energy, so that means you have to have a good meal before you can dance. Streach your body so you won't pull a muscle, which can be very painful and sometimes can lead to surgery. After streaching, warm up yourself so you can build your stigma, it will help you when you are feeling weak and tired. Always drink water because you are always sweating and you need to hydrate your body.

Fourth, when you are dancing there is never a right to wrong. Its like a test with no answer key, it just keeps going without stoping. Don't doubt yourself because nobody is going to be perfect, if you want to dance like you run the world then trust yourself.

Finally if you enjoy dancing and you have passion, You are going to be unstopable. All you just have to remember is to just have fun and be you. Teach others and show them that if they are feeling alone, they are never alone because you will be right there next to them guideing them every step of the way.

In conclusion this activity is super enjoyable and fun because you will meet new people and you will have new friends and people who share the same intrest as you. Just remeber as long as you, put your mind and heart into whatever you want to do, anything is possible thats why this activity taught me so much about loving myself.        ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0

Finish the high school in three year is a big bad idea because is to short to finish the high school,

and another parts some students don't wants to go more to the school so they choose that new program for a short year to graduate in high school.

The other parts is not for all High schools to finish in three year, so is most better to delete that program and cancel about to finish the high school in three year and the students who follow that program they need to take the normal high school. To change the new program for all high school of the country is not easy, because some schools don't agree to doing that so is most better to continue the traditional four years.

If they change that program for all schools of the country they have a big responsibility about that, because most of

High Schools they have a big problem and work for example to change like that credit for graduate to the high school, the SOL text so is not a very good idea to doing that.

The conclusion, this is the best option, is to follow the rules of the schools. One should not make a big problem with the laws and the constitution of the schools.

Working with a group is more like team work, is more like people doing less, what i mean by people doing less is that when you are working with a group you normally don't do a lot, you are all helping each others and that makes you more like a person that is not secure of yourself, is like a person that will always need someone to be helping you

Working with a group is not too bad but it can be, me as a student i do like to work with my friends but they always copying me which i do not like, it makes me feel like they will not be able to do good in life without me. Is sad the way they always have to be in a team to be a better person in life, which is not fair because some times they are not even the person that did the work.

I prefer to work alone better than to work with a team, is not like i do not like to work with other people; that is just how i am. When i work with other people i feel like it doesn't benefits me because they are either cheating or not helping, working by myself makes me feel more me, it makes me want to keep going without having to worry about others. It makes me feel like i can do more without having to need help from others.

In this world i have learned so much things, i have learned that you need to put you first, you need to think about you first, also that you need to have your own back. Working with a group in my opinion is something that should never happen, you might be asking why?. and my answer is that you should never feel useless, you should always think about yourself.

E8E07D453C9B,"Technology allows people to complete many tasks, without having contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person has limitation on humans contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people's lives. I believe that technology had positive effects on people's lives because we can talk with people in long distance, working online without driving,and find new friends.

The first reason is that technology had positive effects on people's lives is because we can talk with our family that are not with us. Also when we missed them we can video call each other, and know about each others life. For example if there was no technology we can't talk with our families that are in long distance. And we don't know about each other, and maybe we will forget each others by the time past. That's why technology is the best thing that we have in our lives. Everyone should have technology because it's important for them and maybe something happen to you like accident and your family can find you by using their technology and find where the accident is happen. furthermore you can use technology when you are sick and you can't go to your work you can call your boss to tell him/her that you can't come today, if there was no technology it wasn't possible to do these things.

Second reason is that technology had positive effects on people's lives because people can work online without driving and vesting their time. Initially when you working online you can save your money and can do all of your work in your house. However that's good because if you have a children and you want to be with her/him it can help you because you can do your work and be with your child. Furthermore if you can't drive and you wish to work at home technology will help you to work online without driving long distance. Furthermore technology is good thing when you want to travel you can travel and at the same time you can work by your technology, and you can make more money.

Third reason is that technology had positive effects on people's lives that we can find new friends ,culture and new languages. Initially when you go to social media you can see different people with different culture and you want to know about their culture and their languages, so technology will help you to communicate with them and ask them question about their religion, country and etc. Furthermore when you going to some other country that you don't know your way technology will helps you to find your way. For example when you going to the country that you love to know about that country more but you can't ask question because you don't know the people, and their language in there, also you lost yourself in there you can't talk or ask them for help. That's when you can use technology to helps you, you can talk with them by using your phone translator.

Technology had positive effects on people's lives technology helps people with more stuff, and they can use technology as a useful thing we use technology for everything.",3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0
E8F6D6EA06F1,"Should you agree to letting the school board add one and a half hour to the school days.

I disagree because it will make students less excited to come back to school the next day.

Students already have the work they have to do after school, adding more time to the schools will give less time for what the students have to do once they get home.

Students have the work in school that they get normally, but once the school board adds more time, the students will have the stress that they don't need.

The time that the school board adds will impact the students time, stress, and family management.

Students will come to school with less happiness.

Once the student gets to the school, they will have to do the same work with more time that they could have used to do their daily needs.

Students need the time with their love ones so that they could get work off of their minds.

Students will have to come back to school with one and a half less time to regain their thoughts and sleep for the next day.

Giving more time to schools will effect student's daily plans.

When the student goes home its for their time to get the work form the school done and to enjoy the time with their family.

Adding more time will effect the family time together, in replace that they will have to work on the time they wanted to talk with their family.

Students will argue to the school that it is unfair that they have to have more time in school, then they will be mad that they have to take one and a half hour away from the time they get out of school.

Adding more time to the school will put more stress on the students.

Students already have work on their mind when they are in school, adding more time will just add more work that leads to stress.

Once the student has stress they have to find a way to get it out but, they have to to work in the school and get work to do at home gives the student no time to get it out.

The stress that the student has can build up to make it turn to anger and frustration, the they can use it in means that they will regret in t he future.

Adding one and a half hour can put students in a tight spot.

Students will be upset to come to school, given what they have heard.

Students have to budget their time after school.

E91D1A0039C3,"Sometimes is really hard to get this opportunities. If students get the chance to learn about what they like they should take advantage of it. They might learn things that interested them. Although some students think this opportunities are useless, actually it opens a lot of doors at a young age to learn about the things they like. For some students this is a big privilege. Find out who they are.

A few of this students are not really insterested in this opportunities. They tend to think that is useless just because they don't have the program they are insterested in. Normally people get use to the things they like, and they don't want to learn new things. Sometimes is hard to see that learning about new things could give huge benefits.

Other students realize that it could be fun to learn about new things. If they are lucky enough they could find the career they like. When kids start to go to school teachers always ask them to think about what they want to be when they grow up. Almost everyone wants to be a policeman, a fireman, a teacher, or a doctor. When they grow up their way of thinking chances. Kids realize that there are a lot of other things that they could like. While others grow with the same mentality. Some of them make it happen, but some others change their mind in the way. It does not only happens when they are little. It could happen when they grow up, so they should give it a try to new things. It might be better than it looks.

Also, If they find the program they like and try it out they might find out if they truly like it. I had a friend, and he really loved psychology. He took the class this year because he thought it could be interesting. Midway through the year he found out that he is not so good at it. Although it was too late to back up he realized that psychology was not what he was looking for. Sometimes people believe they have what they want and that there is nothing that could stop it. They all should have a second plan in case plan A is not working so well. Everyone should be ready just incase there is a rush change, and they have to take a decision in less than a day. They have to hope the best and get ready for the worst.

Some students think this opportunity is lame for not having what they want to learn about. Some others see that there are a lot of benefits in it and go for it. I classify myself as the kind of student that takes new chances. I also have two careers in mind. I know if one of them fails me I still have the other one. This is why I should get the opportunity to go. I truly want to know if the careers I have in mind are what I want to do the rest of my life.

E926BE6F104E,"Working in a group can be helpful. Working alone is also good for you because you can focus and get the job done without being distracted. Seeing people working in groups shows that really only 2 people do the work and the rest play around. You also dont get the full learning experince working in a group than you get working alone. When you work in a group you dont know your strengths and weaknesses your just wondering what to do but when working alone, you can realize what you need help on and what you dont need help on. Working in a group can make you lazy, because you depend on your group to do the work for you most of the time.

Personally I would rather work alone than work with a group. Working alone gives you peace, quiet and space that will help you work at a fast pace. When you work alone you tend to ask your teacher qustions in order to help you and thats good. Its also gives you the power to do what you thinks right. Working in a group, you cant do what you think is right the whole group gets to decide the answer. Working alone can also benifet you by your grade they show you how well you did on it or if you did bad. If you did bad then you can study and see what your missing out on and that can make you better and understand the topic correctly next time. My personal preference is working alone even though working in a group that could be a great experince I'd rather work alone. It gives me motivation to get my work done faster then not caring. You can get distracted and carried away fast at this day and age. Alot of students love to work alone its a great time to themselves and to finish their work. Working alone saves you the trouble of getting blamed for something you shouldn't have been blamed for.

So i think working alone is more benificial for everyone. Unless you are assigned a project and its due very quickly then thats the perfect way to work in a group. But thats a whole different story. At the end of the day i will rather choose to work alone than in a group but some might think otherwise.",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0

EA03135D3C88,"Student-designed

Wouldn`t it be exciting for a student to create a summer projects for their fellow students to do during summer break? Summer break is a time for students to have fun with their families and friends. It a time to travel to so many places like Generic_City, Florida, California, and so forth. Furthermore, it`s great for students to complete summer projects during their break so their brains and memories can still be refreshed and for them not to forget most of the school materials they have learned before summer break. Moreover, requiring students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break is a brilliant idea. But these summer projects should be student-designed because the projects will be exciting, students will be more engaged with the projects, and the student-designed projects will definitely be less harder.

The first reason the summer projects should be a student-designed is because the projects will be exciting and enjoyable for other students. For example, when a students designs a Kahoot for their fellow students to use to study for their test and quizzes, it will be exciting just because the students will get to choose any names they wish. So, a Kahoot is a game that teachers use to create a test or quizzes for students to study to get them prepared for their test and quizzes. The Kahoot can be used inside and outside of the school premises. The student designing the kahoot will get to choose how many seconds or minutes it should take the students to answer their questions. Also, most teachers don`t give students enough time for them to choose their answers and that is unfair. Students needs more time at least 20 to 30 seconds to think about the questions before answering and not rush to choose any answer just because the teacher didn`t give them enough time. Students complain about how much time teachers give them because they need more time to work on their projects. For instance, teachers design boring projects like making a word puzzel about math. That is so boring because no students wants to spend their time making a word puzzle about math instead of doing other fun things like reading, going to the movie theater, going on vacation, and spending time with their families and friends. Most of the students don`t find math interesting beccause they don`t like doing math.

Another reason is that students will be more engaged with the projects. For instance, a student designed a project about each students choosing their own topic argumentative essay like increasing the minimum wage, the college tuition, and discrimination. After that, the student will design another projects about presentations. The presentation will teach them how to present to their fellow students and also how to present in future times like jobs. The presentation will also help them master the skills of presenting. When a student designs the projects, the student will give the students extra time to work on it because teachers will give students less time on their project and expect the students to be prepared when they are not. Furthermore, the students will decide if they need to present to teachers because most students are nervous to do that. And also they have not mastered the skill of presenting yet. The students will also decide how many words will be in each slides, how many slides they need, and how many minutes they need to present. Most of the times, teachers give students less time to present. Due to the less time, students won`t be able to finish what they have in mind or what they have to say and they will have to be rushed to finish before time is over. And if the students didn`t reach the time given or went over the time given, points will be deducted. But when the students chooses how they want their presentations to be, they are more likely to work on it more than when a teacher tells them how to do their own presentations.

The third reason is because the student-designed project will be less harder for students to do. For example, there was a project my history teacher assigned us to do, it was a project about the Progressive Era to make sure that we understand what it was all about. We had to come up with a creative title and 3 categories for the project. It was hard for us to do because we had to come up with a creative title that connects with the topic and 3 categories that 20 sub-heading can fit on one of them. If it was a student designed the project, it would be less harder because either the title is given to us, or we don`t have to create one. And also the 3 categories will be given to use to make it a little more easier. Then all we have to do is put the 20 sub-heading in their right categories and also insert some images where it suppose to be. Another example was when my AVID teacher gave a project about researching the college of our choice. It`s great that we had to choose the college of our choice, but the questions and the rubric was unclear. They were almost the same question and it was difficult for us to answer it because we couldn`t give the same answer to all the questions. Even though some people say that teacher-designed will be so much better because students will tend to take it seriously than a student-designed; however, student-designed is better because its made by a student and it will less stressful, while teacher-designed will be a lot harder and frustrating to do.

In conclusion, student-designed is better because its more fun, engaging, and easier to do than teacher-designed. Students need more time towork on their projects while spending time with families and friends. It`s great to have fun while learning and not stress out over a project during summer break. Schools need to give students an opportunities for them to design a projects for their follow students, and to show their skills and talents. ",5.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5

There is so many good and bad effects allowing students use their phone for educational puroposes .They can be more bad reasons than good reason beause we have to think how really they are going to use their cellphones, and if it's for educational purpose.

I think allow their cellphones to students is not a good idea because we know that we are young people, and we are not going to use our phone just for educational purposes; we are going to use :our apps , social media ,and that is going to distract our attention in class, makes us faild or test because weare not using our resource for good reason; we know there are students without resposabilities and that's what make cellphones a bad opction.

Some people may think that use our phone in classes can be a good idea because we are going to have more access to technology at school, and more easy research for our classwork. Also people think that we are going to have more privacity for our work. Students said that they can be resposinble at the moment to use their chellphones just for educational purposes.

Allowing cellphones for students can have good and bad effects , it can have good effects because is a easy option for students having their phone for: research information resources, have easy acess to internet ,see videos educationals abut the subject, and find deep information about the subject. The bad effect for students can be :they are going to get distracting , they are not going to do their classwork,and for all that reasons they can lose their classes.

My first reason is cellphones in class are not good tools for students ,because cellphones distract and make students lose their attention to class.

My second reason is cellphones is not a thing that we need for learn because our parents, teachers ,family in their time was no cellphone ,and they learn by other resources like books ,so is not a thing that we really need. there are computers we can use them for when we really needed .

My third reason is that cellphone is not necessary for our educational purpose because we can have better resources than a cellphone ; we have the most beautiful thing in this world and that are books our better resource.

Some schools allow their students to use their cellphone to a educational purpose they think that is a good idea to have cellphones in their classroom but in my opinion is a distracting thing ,and is not necessary for our educational purpose ; we have good tools for example one are the books and internet but not using our cellphones at class because we know that we are not goin to use for educational purpose, and cellphone are going to distract us.

EAB74EEE65B3,"Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others.

Everyday after school my brother and I go to the library to do our homework, when we get there I don't have any contact with him nor him with me. Nowadays, when I go to the library I can see many people sitting there, staring at the screen of a computer without having contact with the other person that it is near them. Having access to technology has positive effects but it also have negative effects. The limitation use of technology has negative effects on people's lives because it keeps us away from the ones that are near us, it can damage our way of living, and also it can make us to become addicted to it.

While we are in touch with technology, we are keeping away our self from the ones that are near us. For example, I have this friend we have always eat lunch together none of us have a cellphone, but one day my friend came to school with a cellphone that her mom bought for her. We were eating lunch, I was talking to her, but she was not listening to me because she was more into her cellphone than me. Technology can allow us to have contact with the ones that are far away from us, but we need to manage our time we can talk to them when we are alone and not when we are near a person that we can talk to. Having any type of technology near us while we are with somebody else it is not a good idea. Therefore, one day I decided to let my friend being herself with her cellphone, and I stop eating lunch with her. Technology send me away from her even though maybe she did not want that to happened. From that day I learned that if I want to keep the person that it is always near me, I just need to give them more attention instead of giving all my attention to a cellphone.

To continue, technology can damage our way of living, it can effect us in a way that we have not even think about it. For instance, when I turned seventeen years old my parents bought me a cellphone, from then I was too lazy to do my homework and refuse to talk to them because I have a cellphone and I can be in contact with the ones that are not near me. Access to technology made me lazy and careless about school. One day my parents decided to took my cellphone for a week I was really mad at them that I stop eating and then I got sick. Meanwhile, technology can help people with their tasks, but it can also make people careless about important things that can be useful for their future.

Some say that the use of technology have a great positive effect in our life, but I disagree with it because the use of technology it just stop us from being active with others and become careless about things that we were interesting in. For example, I was really interested on taking dancing lessons, so I decided that I can just watch dancing videos in my computer and it will be the same, but actually I did not watch the dancing lesson videos, I ended up watching something else that it does not have anything to do with dancing lessons. While some people think that technology have positive effects, I don't think the same. With the use of technology everyday we become addicted to it. Therefore I think technology does not have positive effect on people's life it might have some positives effects but there are more negative effects than positives.

In conclusion, Technology allows people to complete many tasks and can help us to connect with others around the world but are we really giving some time to the ones that are near us? I don't think so. Let's be positive don't let technology take away the people near us. Let's think smart we can do better in our life without being sitting there for an hour or more staring to a computer, cellphone or another electronic device when we can be enjoying the people that it is always there for us, near to us, and giving their time to us.

EAEE04B1F712,"Scientist Albert Einstein once said, "" Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I agree, why do I agree with scientist Albert Einstein. When you use your imagination,

you can create it in your mind first, you can invent it, you can make the world a better place with it.

First, when you use imagination you create it in your mind, you can go to your happy place and just build it you see how it's. Your brain helps you imagine it right, for example in the game called Fortnite, you imagine what you want to build before you build it and how it's going to look like. In knowledge you just know it you can't make it more beautiful. When you use imagination you can see the problems that might happen when you are trying to build something in your mind. That's why imagination is more important than knowledge.

Furthermore, imagination can help you invent stuff like flying cars. I can use my imagination and and think about what can i do to build a flying car and boom! now you know how you can build it. You need imagination more than knowledge. I am not going to say you can't build flying cars with knowledge but, with imagination you can make it better. Imagination is literary a image in your mind, its like you drawing the things you want to invent on a piece of paper, and just adding some colors to it. In knowledge it's like you knowing the answer to a math question or just about any question.

Finally, imagination makes the world a better place, how does imagination make the world a better place. Well it has a lot of reasons but the best reason is, it makes people happy if people are happy then there is no violence in the world. If we don't use our imagination there would be no light bulbs or nothing. If you dreamed about something, with your imagination you can accomplish that dream and make your life better, and maybe that dream was you becoming a teacher than you're making your life better and the world a better place.

EB0F373C1D2A,"Summer breaks in most countries are 45-60 days long. Students mostly enjoy the summer by going to a vacation or doing fun stuff. From students' point of view, 60 day summer break is the last thing they want to lose. However, most student lose track of their studies after spending such a long break away from school.

Furthermore, being 60 days away from your frisbee practice would massively impact your game; and the same applies to to studying, you will forget most of the lessons that you've learned. One might say, ""well there are summer classes to keep students connected with their studies."" But to be absolutely honest, no one wants to go to school in a hot summer day. We all want to lay low and have a cold drink in beach while listening to the satisifying sound of waves.

What is the solution? Put an end to long summer breaks (not completely removing them), and instead give students a week off after every 4 week of studying. It gives students and the faculty a brief break after every 4 week, and also it gives students time to work on their important projects. For instance, if I'm studying History of US Museums, I can get a chance to explore the museums and write an article of my own observation about museums in my area. Student can't get everything done on weekends so they need more time. Teachers on the other hand can keep track of the students during the 7-day break and ask them for their progression. Moreover, this gives students to participate in community services and/or religious services, which in my opinion, are crucial in building one's character. The summer break, however, is still there but shrinked to 2 weeks, giving students a chance to go on vacations and trips but not for long.

All in all, 7-day break after every 2 week of school keeps students involved and connected to their studies, community and religion; while giving them the freedom they need to enjoy their summer without losing track of all the studies. ",4.5,5.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5

Everyday all people go to they own jobs and they use a machines to get the job easy and don't get tired quick we don't need to work all days we need to spend time with the family and do a food watch a movie talk about what are doing at job, school, the family is the property more important in us lifes, we need to get a job for to get that familie in good healthy. the childrens they had less than 16 years they don't understant the importance its to get a job and get money we spend in the future to buy a new thing the people invented or to buy things for the family, this childrens they only think about games, friends and they don't think about the importance the family is and saw how famly is very happy when they see we do the same things to the experience they teach, when parents teach something they do to us get a better life and don't get bad friends bad deccisions, bad influences, they think about own future they want to see that little son grow up for to do good things in own life and don't be never go down, us parents want to see we form a good family in a good place and that family never go down, the childrens we need to teach the all good things in this world and don't give games, phones the electronic devices for they birthay, they dont need all that, the need spend time to family in a river camping on the beach, but the electronic only do bad things, i saw a childrens more young then me and they smoke, consume drugs and that thing its not good for us healthy, if you do a tatto when you go to find a job they say, look its a ganster menber and when you listen that you feel really bad, us families and job are help us to us future be a good person. when you loss the job that is hard because you know all about that job and you don't find a similar job, when you get a job don't go a sit or look the iphone, the boss get mad and he say don't come to work anymore that is terrible situation.

The money we get for a job that help us but the money its go and comig againg its things about the life its happen forever and never change the people are be scare to spend they own money but the money come aging, when you spend the money you get for a job uou wold think in what you need to spend that money. maybe a get all this whrong but i try writen all things a listen, saw in my life my experience.

The things of the job you would need to care and dont be destroy, that thing help us to get that job for to much time and get more money to do wherever you want, when you come to other country and you go a house and you saw to much things but the person had all thathe work a lot for to get all he had in his house. The jobs are important because the time we had in that job, we grown up and the experience we get its go up to come to a profecional one day. Everyday we need to wake up and think what you would do in tha all day, try to create a new things use the technology we had for to do wherever we want. we had to much time to think and create, invented a lot thigs maybe that help a people in the future, the people are very important becuase its they don't invented thins like a machines all technology today we saw in the all world, the jobs they had its invented things new everyday and surprice the people. the jobs this perons had, the technology help they a lot to contine and the population grown up.

In this world many people everyday they wake up and they dont do nothing they only walk around the house and they dont go to work they avert they family, friends only for not go to the job, the family and many friends are important because that people help you to continue your life, if you alone you would be get fell sad and you cry, and you would get the smoke drink alcohol, and you destroy your own life, you wold need go out side and spend time with family and friends everyday, and be happy..",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5
EBD559A9576C,"Being yourself is being true to yourself and to others for example. When you're hanging out with a group of people. Don't act like someone else but yourself because you will get caught for trying to be someone that you're not and get made fun of for being something that you're not. It's better to be yourself because you want people to like who you really are. Not someone you ain't your just lying to yourself and others.

Ralph Waldo Emerson was a Author who believe ''to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment''. I agree with that statement but not so many could say the same. There is many human on this planet who cant accomplishment being their self than being someone else than their self .

Many people struggle to be their self because of society. Society brain washes people to be someone else than being their self.

Nowadays being yourself is lame and being someone else is Amazing to some people. Their is con on being someone else like lying to people until they fine out who you really are. Than they might not like who you really are then your feelings are hurt . Therefore your friendless and hurt ,But you could always pick yourself up by being yourself. Than by over time people will start to notice how you change and they will want to have relationship with you.

It's healthy to have relationships with you being yourself than being someone else. The reason why i am saying that is because you dont want to be lying to the other person the whole time during the relationship . It will bring problems to the relationships .However its always a good idea to talk it out and come clean.

Being yourself make a huge impacts in people daily life. It could go for the good or the worse its all up to the person. Therefore its important to be yourself always no matter what or whats the cost of it . Also make sure to take pride of being yourself.        ",2.5,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5

positive attitude is the key to become success in life because it has been said that in order for you to have job you need to be to have a positive attitude because that's what called the costumer's attention. It has been said that if you are a positive person you can became 10 times more successful then a person that is not because you are more likely to have a better job, have more friend and be more healthful . a lot of people would like to be around you for the reason that you are positive person and you always would bring them positive energy and also when you have a possitive attitude you are always thinking good things are going to happend in your life you are so patient you do not rush for think in life to be the way you want them to be also you leat things happend in the appropriate time because better things become in life if you wait for them in the appropriate time.

ECB127F00953,"I disagree, I think if you are honest all the time, you might say some mean things to a person, which might hurt their feelings.

First, being honest is good, that's how you earn trust. However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.

Firstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.

Secondly, If you are honest ""all the time"" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that ""honesty"" and ""truth"" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.

Lastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.

ED06CD30103F,"Have you ever wondered when is it a good idea for people to start thinking about what they want to do for a living. They are many reasons why high school kids need to start thinking about what they want to do for a living. Im going to tell you why it is a good idea for high school kids to have a (an) idea of what they want to do for a living. However, some people think it's a bad idea for them to start thinking what they want to do for a living.

If people dont start knowing what they like at a young age then they will not know what the want to do in the future. We should start knowing what we want to do by the end of high school for many reasons. When we finish high school we should go straight to college so we can study about what we want to do. They're many people in the world that still dont know what they want to do; and that is because they didn't know what they want to do. You should always know what you want to do for a living once your out of high school.

People in high school only think about living life and not thinking about what they want to do fro their life. They're many people in high school (including me) that just want to live life with out a job and just got party. Life doesn't for that way. If you want to work at McDonald, Burger king, etc the you won't be able to party like you want. All your going to do is work, work, and work all day. If you start think about what you want to do for a living right now, then when your older you wont be working all day. You will be able to take a vacation or have time with your family.

Some people think that if you wait until your an adult to know what you want to do, then its better, but thats not what I think. You should know what you want to do by the end of high school. Then when your older, like in your 50s or 60s then you can retire and not bust your butt of working at a minimum wage job for your whole life. Thats my reasons why I think its better to know what you want to do for a living once your in high school.",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0

Some people believe students need to take a music, a drama, or art classes. I believe students need to take electives classes , so students can choose the classes they need , students have more oportunity to choose classes they like, and they can choose the classes with more opportunity for get more credit. Finally students can choose the claases they need to graduate.

First reason, is students can choose the classes they need , so they can have more oportunity to choose the classes they need for get the diploma, they can choose the classes for get more credit, this is a good idea students can choose a electives classes so tehy can talk with the teachers to choose classes tehy need to graduated. Many others students do not like music or drama claases, students have oportunity if they can choose electives classes so they can have few classes, they can have more time after school if they have a job.

Second reason, is students have more oportunity to choose classes tehy like, many others students doesn't like arts or drama classes, in my opinion this is a good idea students can choose classes they like, this help students to work in classes they like and have a good grades.

Last reason, students can choose classes with more oportunity, students can choose classes can help then to get credit for the diploma, students can talk witg teachers they can help then to get claases they need, this is a oportunity to students they work after school, this can help many students to get a good grades and pass all they classes.

In conclusion, this argument can help students to choose classes that can help then to pass the grade or maybe to graduated, this have many oportunity to choose electives classes, in my opinion i dont like drama and arts classes.                       ",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0

A character is defined by what do they do into the story made by their improvements, skills and influences.

For Example: A character that like to be actor in a story is because he likes to be a character into a story.

Here are some Reasons

A character will be himself something that He like to do in a story and not what people want because too many people like the same story and everyone has different opcions.

a person that thinks that He create His own character it's totally wrong what happened is that He laike the character a lot and He thinks that the character is doing what He want.

That;s why many people thing that they can create their own character when the only thing that they do is to choose their favorite character in the story or een in a movie.

A character is the one that do all that he can give and not the one that has more power because in the story their work is to make people thing that what happen in the story is true.

For example at the end of the story some character are acting like they're dead or any other reason to tell the public that the story is real and make people thing that they are into the story too.

Like I said the job of characters is to get the attention of the person who is reading the story or watching a movie.

Although some schools offer distances learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing. I disagree to students take the classes on home because they not learn the same as in the school, if students have a question, or doubt did not have a teacher to asking, and Students did not have the same opcion like others students.

The students who take classes from home, not learn the same in the school and this can be are difficult for them. For example, most of students lose the test because they forget the impormation that they learn in online classes and the time of the test they not remember enyting. Sincerity, take classes from home it is difficult for students the short learning because they not have the same capacity like others students. The students can be improve in the school more that from home, because from home they teaching they self. In addition, most of school believe that give classes from home can be helf students, but this is a big error.

If the students have a question, or doubt did not have a teacher to asking since, they answer themself. For example, sometimes the students do not know how to make homework, project, etc and they need someone to helf them. Also, every students need a teacher to explain everything that they need to make, and if they make the classes from home is impossible to make the thing good if did not have a teacher. It not the same to make the calsses online or in school because in online it is person who teaching for only a short moment, nevertheless in the school the teacher teaching for like 8 hours and helf in sonthing that students need. In effect,

some students do not have capacity to make the classes from home, they needing to make the classes in the school to learn more.

Students did not have the same opcion like others students like the time or the learning. For example, most of them have a job and they not have the time to take the classes from home, because they lose the time in the job and when they going to the home they are tired and only going to sleep. While, the others students improve their life in the schools the others students who make the classes onlone not learn enything because they not have time. Make the classes from home it is not necesary for students because they can going to school every day and work after school and with this method they have more chance to improve they learning. Truly, The school give the option but the students have the choice.

Working in a group is so much beneficial because within a group your able to get your work done quicker and efficient. ""who doesn't want that? I know I do"". With a group you can also interact and descuse with your peers about your work and get feed back.

Weather or not you agree or disagree with this position. One good thing about working alone is that there are no group distractions. Example you might have that one person in your group that does nothing and just fools around the whole time. Never...

One of the benefits in working in a group is being able to get your work done quicker rather than working by yourself. For example what if you have an SA due in a week and a slideshow to go with it? But you had a choice to to work by yourself or within a group,''I wouldn't think twice about it, I would go with a group"".

Also In groups you can discuse and interact with your peers. Groups can also help one another and give eachother feed back depending on what your working one.

Another benefit working within a group is being able to have multiple ideas, thoughts rather than just you having to think and work on everything by yourself. This is the best thing there is to working in a group is that all of you have ideas weather there the same or diffrent,groups can combine eachothers thoughts and ideas to make somthing incredible.

Failure make people to give up when they mess up something but they has to keep going and doing thing possitive. Now i going to writting some example and information about the enthusiams and failure.

First, In this life if we not make a mistake (failure) we are not going to learn anything but we has to know if we fail we always has to try again and again no better what. We always need to thing possitive and has the enthusiams to do it again and get what ever we want in this life but always with the enthusiams because we need to has enthusiams to try again. Don't drop out your dreams if thing not going well.

Second, we need the enthusiams in our lifes no better if we failure, the enthusimas is the impulse to keep going and get everything like finish high schools, past the test, has a good grade but first thing possite and be enthusiams in things you really want to be successful in the future.

Third, the enthusiam is a great enjoyment, interest or approval . I think everyone has interest in something and we can make it, we can has everything but if propose in life. For me, my enthusiams is graduate from high school to make mother proud of me because thats why she came to United State to give me a better future and now she enthusiams to see her daugther graduate from high schools.

Addition, ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" in this quote said failure to failure is an instance of something not functioning properly but is not mean to give up just doing again but never loss enthusiasm to thing you love or want in the future just keep going make yourself proud of you and but never lost the entusiasm you has for things you love just because people talk bad things or thing is not good well, life give lesson to see if we are strong. Enthusiasm is everything in life.

conclusion, I will said that Minister Winston Churchill is rigth because how i said in the beginning of my first paragraphs enthusiams is everything in life, we need to has enthusiams in everything we do to make it better.

EEDF62EFA5D7,"Thomas Jefferson Prompt

Thomas Jefferson once said, Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Jefferson wanted the world to become more active in life whether if it is a physical.

Being active has many positives. Activity in society can help people reach their goals, help society, live life to the fullest, feel good and use time wisely. In this world people have big reasons to have activity life for example, they need one work where maybe all the time they are move for this reasons and more I think that the people need one activity life.

Small actions like recycling or participating in community this help to disperse a good life for you and for the other people because people look that you have one purpose in the life. The life is hard, you need activity, you need to learn new things all the time, and never you be a inactive person because if you are a inactive person you not have good reason for live in this world.

Inactivity is not good for your dreams or goals in the life because if you have one dream about buy a sport car, the car is not coming if you not work hard to take the money for the sport car. Nothing coming so easy you need effort, and dedication the inactivity not help you, the essence of the life is to crate good reason of live and work for yours dreams and goals.

The idle person is a person how not have activity, That person maybe not have dreams or goals or maybe your dream is be idle, but the poin is that a idle person not have reasons for the society, not have support for your community, and he or she is lost in the life. For a idle all is for tomorrow not take actions today, not take effort and if make this person not put the one hundred percent only put five percent. Remember you need put effort to your activitys in the work, school, sports and your life all need effort.

would disagree for adding a one hour and a half hour because maybe parents might be worried about their child or children at school for another hour or two. I would say why would students want another hour of school if they just want to go home and see their family. i would even say that i would not want another hour of school cause isn't seven hours of school enough already. I can understand if teachers want to see their students even more maybe but maybe they have to email their students parents before having to get the extra hour of school. What i would say is that all the students should vote online or in public to see if they all want to have a extra hour or half a hour still because it can`t be the parents only because it`s not fair for the adults to decide if they have to get another hour or two the students have to decide because they are the ones that are gonna have the extra hour.

I

understand that kids might want to do activities for their school or they can stay after school to do it like, assignments,homework,projects,PowerPoints,tests,and quizzes. I usually would`nt want to have another because it`s complicated sometimes doing stuff there and it is just to much for me to handle at one time mostly and i have to do a lot stuff at home also so i rather not have another hour of school cause it`s a lot.

When you are always doing something you get more things done and out of the way. You will not be behind on anything. This is a good habit to have because it can affect you in the long run. For example, when you get older and have to pay taxes or bills. You will be caught up and on time which is really good for your credit score.

You will not be considered lazy. Many people in your life will notice how you like to get things done. This habit will definitely get you a job. No employer is looking for someone lazy and does not like to do things. Keeping yourself busy can be therapeutic. Many people do this to relive stress or think about things instead of being useless.

You will learn new things. Take advantage of the things you do because it can lead you to new opportunities. You can experience different things which is phenomenal. It is always fun keeping yourself busy because you feel great after the things you have accomplished. The more things you learn the more things you can try to keep yourself busy.

Some people say inactivity serves a purpose, but they are wrong because when you are always doing something it keeps you motivated, experienced and makes a good habit to have. In the future I hope we have less useless people and more people who like to get things done.  ",4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0
EF36F9497E96,"I think i'm going to agree what Churchill had said. Because, if i success so easily, i won't able to understand how hard to earn something. Some people think they are smart and they'd never fail. But me, i thought a different way. I thought that if i fail,i 'll have more experience. For an example, in my country, Vietnam, people always say that failure is the key lead to your success. I have failed many times in my life, but i never give up. I remembered when i was 8, i was really love the egg that my mom made for me. So i asked her how to made that egg, and of course i had broken a lot of eggs. And i also wanted to give up, but, i'm really love the foods that made from egg. So i continued learning how to cook the egg, and now i succeed with the fried egg dish. In my conclusion, i want to say that being a failure isn't a bad thing, because it helps me know that i can do better.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5
EF8047505E53,"Thomas Jefferson once said, ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Being active like career goals and helping others and being inactive can lead to alot of health proplems.

Do people accomplish more if there pursuing their own interest, or just being inactive also accomplish goals also?

Being inactive can lead to health benefits, and also your not helping yourself in life, also there is no purpose. If not being active can lead to an unsuccessful life. Just being inactive is bad in general but people do have opinions on about it. Some people like to stay inside, not get a job, dropout of school, and fisk of having a unhealty body.

Being out of contact of the world is bad, and it very unhealthy to do that.

Next is being active. It serves a purpose, and it benefits a lot in life like: maybe healthy body, pursing career goals, school goals, and helping others. Getting a job is good example of being active. Taking time out of the day to go accomplish anything that people are interested in is a good idea. People can pursue new learning skills in school or universities. Being active and getting goals accomplished is good in life.

Having to participate in a activity will do good in life. As Jefferson said ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much mat be dine if we are always doing"".

EFB208F9EF60,"They say that conserving energy and resources, some buissness have a four day work week consisting ten houres a day. Extending the school day two houres and a four day school week ain't a bad idea for people who need's more help and are focusing on their future and college. Do you think this is a great idea? Yes, because the more time your at school the more time you'll be learning and getting help. If added 2 more houres to school on a four day school week, the more school work will be finished and learned. I think my school should fallow this model because in my opinion test and quiz scores will show a greater improvement over time.

First reason why my school should have a four-day week school with a exteded 2 houres is because, many work can be done at school and teachers would have more time to explain details with deeper nolige. Teachers could have more time to study practice with the students before taking their test like using websites like kahoot's. it/quizlit. live and notes so the students can feel confident of what they have learned. This will be consiting longer periods for every class that every student and teachers will have to make sure every student leave the school grounds successfuly and informed of what they have learned that day.

Second reasons is that being in school for 2 more houres will help you work smoothly at every class. Plus every student will be haveing a three day weeknd from Friday to Sunday to rest and to have more time to complete homeworks and to study for testes and quizies. I could get work done when i have not been in school because i was sick or on vacations to get back on track with my studies and school work. Great idea for people at school becasue they won't have any excuss of loosing or not finishing work.

Those are the reasons why a four-day school week is a fantastic idea with a 3 day weeknd everyday. And ways for students to be ready for college and to get good grades everytime with extra help. ",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5
EFBF293CC2AF,"Dear, Local hospital manager

I would love to visit your hospital because i can imagine my self walking through those doors, smelling medicine and noticing the sound of machines, seeing surgents running and rushing towards the surgery room, soon to save a human's life.

I wanna visit your hospital because i think its pretty cool and brave what you guys do. One reason why i would love to visit your hospital would be because i think that the hospital is a very cool place, surgents get the feeling when they save someones life and they get to use some cool machines that they probably havent used until they started to working in the hospital and they get to open up people and see the inside of a person's body. One other reason why i think it's pretty cool, is that there is three different type's of doctors, the first kind of doctor would be an Intern, which is a doctor that just started there first year as one and that is learning to be the best, another kind is a mid tern resident, which is the second to highest level, one last kind of doctor is the highest which is a resident,i think its smart that you guys have that because i think it keeps everything organized and it keeps every doctor in order. One example why i want to visit the hospital is that i want to make people that they are in good hands, that they are going to be safe, also i wanna become one of the best surgents out there, most of all i just wanna help and save lives, i think its cool that surgents get to use machines and other tools to open up people that need medical help. When i was smaller i would have to take care of my sister because my mom would be busy going to work, one day my sister got cut when she was playing outside she was bleeding a lot that i grabbed some paper and rolled it around her leg and then called my mom because it seem so deep, ever since that day i wanted to be a surgent because i didnt feel disgusted by the blood and stuff, i thought it was pretty cool that i cured her leg, and stopped it bleeding.

I wanna have the opportunity to visit your hospital because i wanna save peoples lives when i grow up and have that desperate feeling when you save someones life. One reason why i want to have that feeling is because, i just wanna save peoples life and make them better, even though it might get exhausted its gonna be worth it because at the end of the day i think of how i saved someone's life. Another reason is because i wanna see how the hospital works and how every gets in managed, i want to learn if there is anymore different kind of doctors for example, there is cardio heart surgery, plastic surgery and more, i wanna be a surgent when i grow up because i wanna save peoples lives, i feel like there is so much good around the world that i wanna do good when i grow up. One example is that, me being a surgent would be a good idea because i can learn and help people that are struggling in life,i wouldnt just get to help people lives inside the building, i would get to save someones life outdoor of the building too because if something happens to someone then i can help them, if i become a surgent then im gonna work hard and learn about medicine to be the best and help anyone that comes through those doors. I wanna become into a doctor/surgent because i just started watching this show and its very interesting because its about doctors saving other peoples lives and how they struggle and how that connects with there life because they feel like they haven't been spending time with there friends or there family because they just have been busy of work and i feel like ive been learning on how i can not struggle in life if i do work as a surgent.

I wanna visit the hospital because when i grow up i wanna become into a surgent and learn about all the medicine out there. One reason why you should let us visit the hospital would be because i wanna get the opportunity to feel to be a surgent one day and learn about everything. Another reason why you should let us visit is because if some kids are interested into becoming into a surgent then they can think of taking a medicine class in high school and learn about it more so they can prepare them self if they become into a doctor or surgent, being a surgent isnt just about opening people up and sowing them and saving peoples lives, its about learning and learning because every time you do something you have never done before in your life, you have just learned something and by getting the opportunity of just going to see the hospital and seeing how it works, i just have learned something new even though i didnt do anything other than watching. One example why you should let us visit is because we would be learning something new and getting to feel how everything works around the hospital if we were to work as a surgent or doctor. I mostly wanna become into a doctor because i think its cool how doctors are brave and work and how good they are at there jobs, mostly its cool because they learn something new everyday and at the end of the day they have saved a lot of peoples lives or changed peoples lives.

A local company i would love to visit is the hospital because i feel like the hospital is very cool, the feeling of saving someones life is incredible, and you get to learn everything about medicine/medical stuff. I think working at a hospital is a gift because you get to learn and everything and save peoples lives and most of all you learn.

I hope you consider thinking of letting my school visiting the hospital.

EFF1803E4B81,"Why are people scared to fail? Is failing really a bad thing. NO! For example Churhcill says that ""success consists of going from failiure to faliure without loss of enthusiasm"". I agree with him. I believe that to have success in life you have to go through failiure. Failing with the same feelings and mindset is hard but you just have to think failing is a way of getting better. Failiure is also not something you should be afraid of or embarressed of. You should be proud of failing cuz you know what you did wrong and next time make it twice as strong. Failing does not mean that your to dumb to do whatever it is. It just means you need some more time. Churchill bleieves that failure has an important role in the pursuit of success. Which I also believe this becuase once you fall all you want to do is get right back up. Which I encourage everyone to do.

When you fall get back up everyone falls. Life is about taking risks and failing. Which in my opinion evryone should do. Failiure is the key to success. Without failing you can't really call it success. I beleive you can only succeed in something that you have failed at. Without failing life would be boring and everything would be the same because people are taking riks we have lots of different things in the world today. Everyone has failed to do something. Not everyone in the world is perfect. I wrote this to persuade my readers to take risks. It is also fine to fail just get up and try again. Surely, if Churchill was a live today her would be spreading the same message around the world. That without failiure there is no success. Also, that everyone has failed at something, nobodies perfect.

Churchill Is trying to say that faliure turns in to success. Once you fail you know what you have to do to get yourself back up. Then you try again and again until you get something you are happy with. This is what makes you try again. This is what makes you find and fix your problems. You get a lot out of failing thats why i think that anyone that is going through something tough don't give up so easily becuase its is ok to fail. Failing is a good thing not a bad. However, its hard for people to think in this way becuase they think once they fail its all over. Its not over until you want it to be over. Keep trying and Try your hardest.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5

I believe the appropriate use of technology does not divide, or limit human contact. If we give a good use to it, we will have great benefits. Besides, technology improves communication skills, helps parents, and facilitate jobs.

Research has proved that technology has been a useful tool for communication skills. This is shown in the facility that we have now at making a call, or video call to another country. It has improve communication for people who are speechless, defeat or just shy. All of them has problem at talking or listening, but with technology this is getting over. And they are interacting in certain way with other people. To sum up, technology is improving communication in different ways.

Parents always have many things to do. Passing time with their children is not easy; however, technology is making easier it. Now parents can work from home; this is giving them the opportunities to share more time in family. Also, for parents that work out new machines are helping them to finish quickly. Although, new phones schedule appointments and others for them, in order to be organize. In resume technology is giving the opportunities to spend time in family to parents.

In centuries before how many time does a writer spend writing a book? Technology has being a helpful tool for years; long time ago a writer spend one year writing a book by hand, now they just spend 3 to 4 months writing a book in a computer. New technology give us a lot of opportunities like:

We do not work all days, We get a good pay, and We do not work in the sun shy. In resume, technology is facilitate our life.

In conclusion, technology is a wonderful tool that let us develop our communication skills, unify families, and makes easier our jobs. People who does not have skill of listing or talking; they can still communicate their selves. families now are more unify. Jobs now are more easy. I believe technology is having a good effect for those who use it appropiately.",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0

Do you think working in groups is more easier?. May people will say No and others will say yes to all these four question. working in groups is more beneficial than working alone. I think working in groups is more beneficial and good for many reasons because; we collaborate and share ideas, it more fun and easy working together and get a chance to work with people we really dont talk to. and we also get our project or work done on time.

Working in groups helps us by sharing ideas: i think working in groups is very important. it helps us bring our minds together to brainstorm some ideas or by sharing opinoin about the project or the assignment we are working on. we can discuss and make sure we understand and know the topic that we are working on. by doing this is a great thing because every person is contributing or participating in what we are working on.

Secondly, We get everything organized and get our things done on time: working alone somethings is very terrible because i takes a while to finsh, you dont get it done on time and sometimes you might need help from somebody, which sucks but working in groups more quicker. since there is about atleast three or four people in the group. it makes it more faster to get it done on time. it makes it even more easier to get the assignment done by contributing and aslo,

assigning or giving each and every person in the group a role to play or something to do to support the group in order to get it done on time.

Lastly, another reason why working in groups is beneficial is because it is easy and fun working together and let us get a chance to work with some people you really dont talk to in school. Most people likes dont like to socialize with people they dont know so they choose to work alone. which is okay,

but i think working as groups fun and easy. plus ,

it is very beneficial. I feel like working in groups is more fun. it makes us feel more free and more open to work together. when working with a group of people it is more fun because someone in the group may crack a joke or say something funny, it might cause a little bit of distraction but it brings laughter, smile, joy and happiness into our faces and that is what makes more fun and exciting to work together as a group.

In conlcusion, it is more beneficial working in groups than working alone. In groups we share ideas, we finish on time before due date and it is more fun and easy to work together with people but not just by yourself. because in groups we disscuss and make sure everyone in the group understand before we start putting effort in what we are about to do. it is very important to work together in groups because it tells us that we should encourage ourselves and work together as a team.

F17DDEB77A2A,"Most students hope and enjoy a summer vacation after a long school year, but some educators thoughts are completely different as the way they should get their vacations. Although, during the summer break some students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall, overall, the summer is a good season to have a school break because of the great weather and the posibilities to get a job for students.

Initially, we all know summer is the best season of the year, because it brings more attractions. Of course, the weather is one of the important factors that makes it possible. For example, amusement parks to entertain people, beaches's opening, as well as others entertainment places to go visit and have fun. Summer also is a known as a time where family can share moments with others and recover all the energies leaving the stress at home. Also many people likes the summer, beacuse you can practice any sport you want outside, a good way to decrease the percent of obesity and improve our helth. Another advantage of the summer is that we have more sun light during this season than winter, spring or fall, it allowing us to get done more stuff we need to do and being productive with our time. In short, the students's vacations should be in summer, because is a great season to do many activities and enjoy with friends and family.

In addition, as we have more attractions, more personal the companies need, which gives to many people the opportunity to get a job. As a students, a job is helpful in several aspects for good on their lives. For example, maturity, responsability , new experiences and connections-which is very important to your future. Each one prepares you as a person to deal with your every day lives. Also, students have enough time to save their money and keep it for their purposes, it can be for a college or buy whatever they want without the necessity to pay with their parents's money. As a result, students are aviable to gain their own money during the summer, because its offer more opportunities, and also gain new experiences that will help them move fordward.

Still, some may say that summer vacations are too long and there should be year-round schools, which would totaly change how long the breaks will be. Then, students can have a balence on their personal lives and scholar lives. The knoledge they aquired is still fresh in their minds so, new stuff to learn will be easier for them and consequently they will obtain good grades. In summary, the significance of the idea to administrate better how long, and the appropiate time for a break is to know if it are gonna affect the student progress, which is the priority of the school.

In conclusion, educators wants the best for students,and they just want to find out a better way to rise their progress making them as a better students improving their knoledges. But, it can becomes as an issue because if you are constantly over preassure, and studying all the time without an a consider time to free your mind, it will get you tired. Overall, the summer vacations will keep you distracted with many productive activities during a long break, which are gonna let you back to school more exited and willing to keep study.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

The things i have experience and has made me the person I'am today, has taught me that doing the same things will not help me learn and grow. Being fearless and taking a risk on something, will change me and anyone else to a more powerful and successful person.

When I was young, my parents had gotten me a bike with training wheels, I had started to ride it and it was pretty difficult to ride. Every day when I came home from school, I would go outside and ride my bike. I started to get better and better, I was'nt struggling anymore. My parent had saw that I have gotten the hang of it and told me that I should try and do it with out the training wheels. I was to afraid and nervous that I wouldnt be able to ride the bike with training wheels so I didn't let him take them off. He told me that if don't take the wheels off, how will I grow and take risks in life when im older and have big things that i'd have to develop and learn what I made a mistake on not doing and learn from my mistake. So i started to think to myself, ""If i didn't take them off how will I know that im good or horrible"". I told my dad to take them off, once he took them off i was pretty scared but then i started to get better and better that i wasn't afraid. I was pretty proud of myself and gave me courage.

Once you've done something in your life that was huge and still did the same thing over and over what would you grow from it. You are in this world to learn and grow. To become a stronger, and successful person to accomplish something big and grow from where they have started. If someone was to started off as a employee at McDonald and was thinking of being a manager somewhere and have his own company how could he do that if he's just a worker at McDonald. If he wanted to be a manager and own his own company, he would have to be the hardest worker there and show that he can handle and work and follow all the rules. He ends up getting a raise and is the employee of the month for showing that he's a hard worker. the manger realizes that he's got a big future ahead of him. Year's later, he's a manager at his own company and is being successful in life he's learned that not giving up and risking things to become what he is now is incredible.

Last but not least, if someone is not challenging them self, how would they know that they are good at it and could be able to do so much. Ralph Waldo has gave people the courage and make them think that they can do anything to become someone you'd never thought you could be. If you believe you can do anything then you are growing and realizing that all you need to do is to be fearless and take risks. That's the point of growing. I have learned so much and ready to learn more and to become successful in my life.

She was my neirbor for 3 years and she didn't talk to much and she was always angry. One day i notice that she was having problems with friends, like me. We were relatived to some things and our first impression.

Sometimes people can be having bad times and that is why their first impression it seems difficult to change. I had a friend that it was having a bad day at work the first time i meet him. Generic_Name was angry and he didn't talk to me that day. After that day i was surprised of his impression . Days after he explain what was happening to him that day.

If you meet a person more closedly you can change their first impression. You can be come a friend to the person, sometimes they change. You would like more that person than the first time. LIke i said before , they can have bad times the first time you see their impression. Not everyone is happy every day.

First impression is not difficult to change , people can due it and people can change it. some said that is impossible to change first impression , but is not , if i can due it with some people , you too can change it.

In the future we will see that first impression is not impossible to be change.  ",3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,3.0
F27DE7F7F3AB,"In my opinion, The school shouldn't have to follow the model by extending the school day two hours. because schools have seven hours school day and when they use two hours for that it will be not help full for students because student. when we use the same amount of time for school that is better for me because student have more time. If we want to make our life easy or conferrable it is not help full. for example if we have a two hours expanding the school day its not helping us because the using our schedule. All school schedule is help full for all who attend the school. so we don't have to use the two hours expanding the school day. The energy of the four-day two hours extending schools extending is not help full for me so. The school follow the school management systems.

we dont have to use the two hours extending police. because,it is not help full for who attend the school and who need more time for his/her class. fore example some student need more time to do the Home work, and assignment. its not helping for that kind of student, some student need more to understand . it mean it is not help full the four-day school week and the extending the school day for two hours. Finally the am disagree with this idea its doesnt help student and teacher in the other way. school have to follow his extending police. ",2.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0

Dear, Mr Generic_Name. I am a student who is in attendance at your high school, writhing to you about the changing of our school menu. I for one think it's a grate idea to change our school menu into a much healthier one.

Our current school menu has its redeeming qualities, but it also has a few lose ends. For example; they serve things like pizza, burgers, rice with chicken, nachos, spaghetti, Pb&j , and salad. Do you see the problem with the food items listed above? 99% of the schools menu contain high levels of fat and carbohydrates, which is not a proper meal for a growing student, or any human being. I remember seeing posters like the food pyramid, posted on the lunch room walls of my middle and elementary schools, but not once did the school lunches follow that expatiation. This is the problem with the school menus all over America today, they serve fatty foods filled with carbohydrates and not enough protein, fibers, and good fats.

As growing students, we need food that'll give us energy through out the day, and keep us focused in our classes, but the current menu isn't serving us the food we need; don't get me wrong, they have things like fruits, vegetables, and other good side options, but that's not enough. We need the main meal/ main dish to be the most healthiest thing on our trays, not the side dishes.

The students at our school may be disappointed with the sudden change in the school menu, but they'll just have to adjust to a healthier menu. It'll be nice if the school menu items was a bit more healthier, but the side options must stay the same. The side options our school menu currently have are just fine; they meet the expatiation's of a healthy side option; the offer fruits vegetables and the occasional desert.

The health of your students and my peers are important, and a big part of being healthy starts with what you put in your body, so please continue with the plan of changing the school menu, our future self's will deeply appreciate it. Thank you for our time.

Sensually, Generic_Name.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
F2DE30047DF9,"They shouldn't extend the school day two hours , because every student have a schedule they run everyday like going to work , playing a sport , or any a school club they are in. The student would like a four day school week but they don't want a extra two hour in school this is a disadvantages if they was considering doing a four day school and only get a few hours to them self and going to school really early. The good benefits of it is that the student gets to have a three day weekend for the whole school year and more time to finish there homework or the work they missing to catch up with there grade for that class. The other disadvantages is if those other two was added the student is not going to pay attention and lose there focus on the lesson also there work or fall asleep in class. If i went to a school that had extra two hours I probable not pay any attention to my teacher or lose my focus and go to sleep till school finish. A other good benefit is that they can shorty the school year and make the holidays week longer or spring break longer. Those are same of good and bad reason toward this topic about having a four day school week i think it could be a some what a great idea so they can have a extra day to relax. Overall this is my opinion and thoughts for having a four day school week.",2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5
F3259CFA6566,"Being yourself brings out the better you in a person. When you are yourself your a better person because your not changing yourself to be someone your not. Sometimes its good to change in your life but don't loose the way you are to be someone worse because your attitude and personality is what stands out the most in you. Most people change because they want to be a better person or they are tired of being so quiet and keep to themselves. The way someone is shows the kind of person you are and to try to change back to the person your not anymore could be difficult because you are changing your ways as a person.

Firstly; being yourself means you are unique in your own way. You don't have to change yourself to prove a point to someone. No matter how mean, rude, disrespectful you are you can't really change the reason I say that is because that is how you are already as a person. Most changes can occur maybe from someone loosing another person like they passed away and it hurts you so much you loose yourself as a person. Changes can reflect you as to what goes on in your life. Like maybe you suffer from abuse, violent actions, or even depression that can change you as a person. Just by being yourself and pushing yourself to change can be such a big change in your life even maybe to your family that are already used to you being a certain way. If you want to change your way of being change to be someone better the who you are now because out don't want to be the person everyone talks about. Just by being yourself you should care about what other people think about you because you are who you are and no one can change that.

Secondly; just by changing you can loose your inner self. You had already been trying to be someone that you like or maybe even respect. If you want to change you should do it for yourself don,t do it for your friends because at the end of the day they won't care who you are or what you are. Most of who you are and what you do can reflect you as a person of good. One thing my grandma would say to me is "" sweetie be yourself don't change yourself for anyone because no one will respect you and love you like your family will"". Be you don't push your inner self away because no matter how rude and annoying you are your still one of the best person in your family. No one deserves to be changed just because people think your not a good person already. Show your inner person because you are probably hiding someone you haven't brought out yet. Most people can bring you down just by talking about you are even getting other people to hate you maybe because your to quite or your not a good person. Be you unique in your own way and show everyone that you are good with who are already.

Thirdly; your personality shows your character as one. No one wants to b friends with someone that he or she is better than everyone else because thats not true. You should always show where you come from even if you are poor and dont live in such a beautiful house. One reason i could say is because most of those things show that you dont care about what people think or say bout you because everyone stands out as who they are. Don't be someone you'll eventually regret being because that could reflect on you changing. If one of your friends, cousins, siblings stops talking to you dont bring out a mean person you weren't supposed to be because they could pull away from you and not want to be near you again. You also can't be a coward just because someone gives you advice on changing the way you are because maybe they are trying to help you be someone better and of good. Be the person that stands out for being himself or herself and not the one that everyone says oh they copy everything

I get or ever wanted to be more popular somewhere be more known as a person.

Fourthly; Changing back someone you had already change to can be difficult because you had already pushed away the person you didnt want to be. Trying to go back to that person you used to be can be long ago by the time you try to change back to that person. Most of the people that pushed away from you now may never come back because of you changing who you are and or were at one point. Most of things you did to change yourself can just now affect you and can never be out back together again. Be yourself dont be that person that tries to back to him or herself just because you dont like the now you. You decide to change to be a better person so move on and keeping that person you wanted to be at one point. You've changed for a reason so now you should em braise it and love your change. Who you chose to be will be that same person you'll possibly be one you are more grown into life.

Lastly; be yourself and dont try to change yourself to be someone your not. Who you are now could help you throughout the rest of your life. Maybe not always be yourself but dont do it or someone that doesnt deserve to see a change in you do it for yourself. Do everything to try and be your own and unique person all at one because a lot of people would like to around you. Just by being yourself could always reflect on who you want to be once you grown up and leave from your families home.",5.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0

F3604BAC5D79,"I agree with the Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill because in my opinion, the failure makes to the people strong and the next time they can do it better. Sometimes we are making failures day per day, but if we become sad and we are closed that we can not do it again, we are losing something important in our life, but if we are doing it with enthusiasm we can improve our failures and do it better every time. Success is the achievement of doing what you have tried to do or what to do. Winston Churchill is referring that no one have to loss the enthusiasm, however if you are making mistakes in your life and you are saying that you can not do it and you will try it but you are going to get the same results and you are giving excuse by excuse you will fail in your life because you are giving up easily and you dont see that every cost and fight at the end it has a benefit or something that you really wanted to get or a goal that you are trying to reach and you will see that you dont have to loss the hope and the enthusiasm in every dream that you want.

The failure has an important role in the pursuit of success, sometimes a lot of people do not have the enthusiasm and they think that it is the end of everything, the failure can be the destruction for a lot of people, but if you make a lot of mistakes and you are keeping fighting still to get your goals you will see how important is not give up easy and watch the positive part of your failures. When Winston Churchill said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,"" he is only saying that sentence but it has a big meaning everybody can apply it in their lives, you can find the best outcomes just smiling to the problems. It does not mean that you will not care the problems, of course you have to resolve the problems and make them clear, because if you are making failures and people is affected and you dont care you just want to get your outcomes it will be a big problem, no body needs to be involved in your failures because the people around you will see that you are making a mistake and you are selfish.

Churchill's statement has big meanings and has good outcomes, everybody wants success but what happen when someone is trying to get success and miss? of course everyone will feel so sad and no one wants to try it again because the person is afraid of their failures, it is like if the failure is tying you and it does not want to leave you. The persons will be sad and their hopes will be down because they think that they are going the get the same outcome, but what happen if you raise your head with enthusiasm? Winston is trying to say us that the enthusiasm is very important to get the success because if you have enthusiasm you will fight with love for something that you really want. An enthusiasm person has more possibilities to get success than a person sad, broken and a person who is thinking just negative thoughts or who is close that they will get the same result and give up easily like nothing will happen if he/she is going to try it.

The enthusiasm has an important role in the success because you will keep your head up and keep fighting for your goals all the time and every time that you will make a failure it will be more easy to resolve it, because you have a key and you are enrolling every time when you get one failure. The enthusiasm help to the people to see the answer of the problems easily because the brain will be relaxed and will think the best things, however, when the brain is frustrated the brain can not think correctly. So, if you are enthusiasm you will do it very good because you want something that you want and also it will be something that will improve your life not just in the success of work or study it can be in all your whole life you can get success and everything if you apply this in your life, and the people around you like your family will see how important is this role in the life and they will want to learn about the enthusiasm in the failures and they will understand that sometimes we dont need to destroy ourselves or lost the head in something that we can resolve in an easy way that enthusiasm is helping us to improve ourselves.

I agree with Churchill's statement because the enthusiasm it is an important role you can motive to other people to be enthusiasm and they can resolve their problems using the same method. Sometimes the failure are really hard to resolve but if you really want to reach it you have to feel enthusiasm because I think that automatically you will see the answer clearly and easily and if you are frustrated your brain will not work and will be closed and sometimes when we are frustrated we are getting extras failure because we dont think clearly and we dont think about it. Sometimes we have to learn a lot from the failure and we dont see it, the failure can be some steps just to reach the success and the goods outcomes. Winston is showing us that the failure can be defeated it does not matter how long it is going to take but before the success you have to keep strong and smiling to the big failure. Winston Churchill is using a statement that means that we dont have to give up easily we have to fight for something that we want to make real.

Example: The success in the school can be really difficult and more than one time we can fail because we dont do homework but we want to pass, so if we want to reach this goal we have to enthusiasm ourselves because we have a goal that we want to reach, so we are going to fix our failure and we are going to do everything because after school we want to go to college and get a good job.

In conclusion, the Churchill's statement has an important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. The failure is just a difficult step to reach the success and with enthusiasm we can defeat to the failures. The enthusiasm is a supply very important in the enroll for the success.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0
F386245C7C21,"Have you ever wondered about your working skills do you prefer working in groups or on your own? How they benefit you in your job or anywhere else?

people say that working together is a better way of doing stuff then just working alone. But theirs other people who prefer working alone. Here are some of the benefits to both sides.

I feel like working in a group is more beneficial because it lets you have a chance to ear new ideas. You can also finish the work faster if everyone is doing something. For example this one time. My friends and I were doing a project for drives Ed. We had sometime to think and write down ideas. After that all of us got together and agreed on some ideas. Then we each had our own part to do and we finished it during class.

Some people believe that working alone is better. You can be more focused on you work. In addtion you can be more creative in your own way. I remember this girl in my biology class had to do her finial exam project. She decided to work by herself. The girl was res reaching and was really focused on that she was looking for. She got her information then made a really creative poster that went with the theme of the project. The teacher loved it and gave her an A for it.

In conclusion working in a group benefits me the most. Their is less work to do. Everyone has good ideas. You get to express thoughts and feelings about your topic. So many more things that working alone doesn't give.    ",3.5,4.0,3.5,2.0,3.5,3.0
F3B7C2480747,"Do you wonder is a great idea to choose a career at a young age?

In my position is a exellent idea to choose career at a young age, Because in some socities, student are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. their are many courses of classes are selected to guide them toward to choose a speficic carrer. for example: first it benefits them to start at the age to have in mind what are some types of career the student want for his or her future after graduated high school. Second thing it would persuade them which type of diploma they would like to have if the advances diploma or the standard diploma, the advance diploma it requires to have 9 sol pass and all the classes and for the for standard it requires 6 sol and all the clases. when you enter to high shool your counselor would guide you which diploma the student want to have and which career for the future. third when you are in high school they give the student basic classes that you need to pass for 9 grade and 10 grade to persuade faster and easier , to have some experiencies and knowleged on what are your goals and be prepared on the others two years,

if you like the same career you pick when you enter high school or you want to change your mind on a diffrent type career want to do, teachers and counselor are a great full help for student to succes to guide the student what are some great benefits the career the students pick to study to give him the amount of money to lived and work with the career and be succesful in the future when the student finished the high school. Finally for 11 grade and 12 grade they give the student some diffult classes to pass to graduated from high school , 11 grade is more diffult to pass, Beacuse it requires 2 classes to graduated pass for to get 12 grade the student only come for the classes the counselor give student to be prepared for what diploma the student choose , if his the advance diploma or standard diploma for his or her carrer the student choose to graudated.

for my conclusion is a wonderful way to start in a young age , To start thiking what would you want for your future if this is a great career to pick and whats benefits give you for your future, in high school they prepared you for what the student planing to do when he or her graduated from high school , if his going to college to have a better life or go nova to be prepared on what you like to do in the future, You hvae some knowleges of what carrer you would succes in the future and start thiking this is what you like for your carrer and make it real the dream what you want to become in the future.

there many career you can choose to become someone in life , this is way i think they should start at the young age when they enter to high school teacher and counselor would do the best to make the student to choose one career studen is interested on. to study in the future and sucess on college to have a better life for her or his family in the future, thats why is great idea to start at the age to pick the career they want to do on future.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0

Enviroment of Impressions

Two million years ago a person named Jesus arrive to this planet to dwell for a several amount of years, an history we all have been told about witch it takes us to it's death, he spoke to us saying he was our Father. However, he was killed becasue of whom he show up to be, and it's here where we see that it does not matter what impression ypu show up with, people don't mind about it, we all live in a world thst only care for our own good, our onw benefits.

I don't agree in frist impressions are impossible to change, I've meet people that I use to hate now they are part of my life their my family. Independence day, you have an job interview, the first thing they get about us it's first impression no matter what we do and pretent to be someone that we obviuosly aren't they only care about your eargerness, charisma, garment, manners, etc. The popular one meeting new people at school at the beginning we can hate everyone but untli we don't meet that person we won't change our perspective about it personality. In fact, most of us guide by first impressions, and thats the same towards us.

Primaly get can easily get impressed by someone or completely disinterested. we are humans it's imossble to represent our reality we are just like social media when we are with our frineds or at a public place, we fake we act we pretent and thats a common thing we aren't realistic with us and thats where we are given first impression. In conclusion, we are who we choose to be and who we deserve to be, we are in the place that we a re supposed to becasue thats what we deserve, whatever we give it;s what we are going to recieve, and we shouldn't be worried about what we're going to get, what matters it's what we give and judging people woon't tkaes us to the highest place.

F47F7676912A,"I met a friend online from Generic_City, therefore I went to visit him and learn a lot about his culture. In this paper I will argue about that the use of technology haves a positive effect on peoples lives and human contact. In my opinion technology haves a positive effect on people lives because they can find new jobs, meet new people , and communicate with other people that you are nervous to talk in person.

Having a hard time finding a job? Theres a lot of jobs available online and you can sign up online without going to the store and ask for a job application. If your sick and can't go to work, therefore you can contact your boss online and ask for a day off and avoid getting fired by not coming to work. If you need to talk to your boss and he is not in work you can send him a online message. You can see that technology helps your job to be more easier without having any problems.

Dont you feel bored knowing only about your culture? You can meet people from different culture online and learn more about there style of life. Technology helps you vision other peoples thoughts and opinion from another country. Technology is the glue that helps a lot of people from different culture work together and hate each other less. people can learn how to fix there mistakes by seeing other people online from different cultures instead of fixing it on your own tradition way that may be harder or useless. For example i learn how to fix a car much more easier by following my friend method from Generic_City.

I havent seen my family for six years and only talk to them by sending text messages. Im shy and nervous to communicate with them in person. Technology helps you built that confidence to talk with other people from around the world or people that you care for. It Doesnt matter if you only communicate with them sending only online messages. At least you are expressing your feelings your thoughts and your opinion to your loves one or your friend that you are shy to talk in person.

Some say technology is ruining human contact with other people in person . But they are wrong because technology helps you to meet new people, find a job, and communicate with people that your are nervous to speak with. I hope one day people around the world understands that without technology we wouldnt have the diversity we have in this world today.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5

Schools with programs that pair old and young students can help students in a lot of thing , for example communication skills , responsibility,and be confident in themselves.

For example: When I try to cook something to eat, sometimes I forgot to add an ingredient. As a result of this mistake the food obtain a different flavor, but of this failure I can learn and upgrade my skills like a chef.

Another example could be: when a student fail in a test, but has the chance to take a retake, is there when the student spend all their time studying to get a better grade. Daily the people commit diverse mistakes, but depend of us to determine if this mistakes will define us. Also we can take with enthusiasm this kind of failures and learn from them. Don't give up, we have to be strong. That a mistake don't stop you of achieve your goals. A characteristic of the humans is that we try to overcome all the challenges that we have in our life.

The failures teach us how to be a best person. The people just have to be more optimistics and see the failures from a good point of view. If you are negative with a failure or mistake, let me tell you that maybe you will loss the battle with yourself. If you are negative, is very probably that you will start to have bad thoughts about yourself. If you are negative, you never will be happy again, because you will stay thinking in the failure you had. I'm telling you all this, because I had this kind of problems previously.

In conclusion, don't let to the failures defeat you. You have to be strong and learn of them, to be a best person in the future. Or you want stay in the same place, with the same problems forever? No, right? You have to figth to overcome all the challenges that will appear in your life, and remember never give up. Let me tell you something else, I don't know a lot of english and I'm taking this test that have to be in english. I'm bringing all of me to get a good grade, what I mean with this. Well, even if I don't have a good grade, I learn many things that will help me in the future.

Dear Generic_Name

I write to teacher Generic_Name today with the benefit of work in group. The work in group is more better then work alone, in the beneficial is the student work in group is have more opportunity of learn more with other students in the class, they can work more better and understand more quickly the theme in the class and have more collaboration, learn to respect other students. They in the group can say new ideas for the team.

I think in the personal the work in group is more productivity in the student because have a good communication with the students and teacher, they have more positive attitude in the ideas and participation.

For example, students in the group work more and learn more quickly because in group have a higher quality of ideas, and students can change ideas together about the theme in the class and have a better determination in the job of the class.

Second, work in group have a big benefit in the class because students understand problems more quickly, and they have solution in theme complicated with ideas and dedication in class.

Third, students have collaboration with other students have a good relation and learn to respect others person for religion or ideas. They have more communication in the class and have more better grade in the school.

However, work alone not have good result because almost all the student have fear to say ideas for the critic of other students in the class, and they have slow work in the class for complication of the theme.

The preference is work with a group have more benefit in the student and teacher to learn and teach other students in the school have more communication, better work and good relation in the school.

sincerely

F591A84185A4,"I was thinking to work at the police station because I can work on cases that could allow me to travel around the world and some cases that can be cool and super fun. It would be fun to work at the police station because you can travel to different countries and cities you have never been to. Therefore, you can explore from above when riding a air plane and you can meet different people. Also experience of what type of cultures people do in their country.

Working at the police station would be cool and super fun because I can work on fun cases, involving to ride different vehicles or going undercover and going places. Just imagine your manager assigned you to go to Korea and you stayed there for a few years. You have made new friends and learned the Korean language. You had to take Tae Kwan Do and you made it to black belt. However you still work with the U.S. police. And you also observe of what they do in Korea, for example, how they harvest rice and at what type of climate they need to be in or how the people eat their food and how younger children greet the older men and women. Also experience what people do in their specific culture and what laws they follow and things they need to respect. And also how they sell to get money.

Also working with police means you are not alone, you have teammates with you. They can also help you on cases that can be dangerous. Your teammates can be helpful and fun because they can help make wise decisions and on something risky, like you have their back and they have yours. They can also be help and caring/fun when you are stressed out and they try to make you feel better or trying to comfort you and not making you feel lonely. For example, On one Sunday morning you felt sick and a strange feeling you had something missing. You ate breakfast and you remembered you needed to finish on one of your assignments your manager had gave you. you felt even more sick. All day you tried to erase the fact that you didn't complete you assignment, you tried to throw that thought away, but you couldn't. You wanted to not even think about and wishing the thought could just disappear. You felt like brain was rotting for thinking too, much. You called you best friend ( that also worked at the police station:) because you wanted some company. When she entered your apartment, she saw that you weren't in the living room. She went to your bedroom noticed that you had been eating junk food all day because you had lots of your favorite corn chips and an empty box of pizza beside you. Just then she started to stare at you, and you were reaching for a bucket of your favorite ice cream, strawberry. She looked at you and saw that you scooped a spoonful of ice cream and you shoved it into your mouth, with your TV on. (You were watching the Titanic with the lights off because you felt sad and had nothing to do) She went up to you and hugged you and asked what has happened to you and why you were feeling down. You told her why you were so miserable and guilty for not finishing your assignment. She stoop up and told you that she was going to help you. You also stoop up lazily, but you felt excitement. You went to go change and finished the assignment on time. This is why it's a good thing to be friends at work for you can't be so lonley.",4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5

They can accomplish this with their ability of communication, talent,

Students like me would like to have the oppurtunity to discover a business employment in your company. I can bring a lot of benifits to it. I have good communication with others and a positive attidude and mindset. I have the ability to come up with many ideas for your makeup line.

My ability of working with others is very good I think is important in a business industry to have that type mindset with other people. Working with others brings positive outcomes, businesses grow more when people know how to work together and know how to communicate with each others. The partnership work is what you need in your comapany, i am a very hard worker.

Bussines can grow more threw out the time when their is , better ideas, new stuff, more hard work something i offering to bring to you.

Shadowing opportunities to discover whether they are interested in pursuing that type of opportunities will make a big change on everyones componies, they will have a lot of new oppportunies to proof that they are really good at what they say they are and proof to them selfs that they are.

Student partnerships pursue students to have new jobs and have a better tabeled life.

Sports is enjoyable activity because athletes use sports as a excuses to get good grades, so they wont have to tell there friends that they are really smart. They do this because they dont want there friends to call them a nerd or what not. Sports can be a fun thing to some people, but others use that to show there smartness without getting laughed at. They can also, use sports to prove to there parents that they are worthy. Sports can be used in a fun way too. Such as, going out on the court or the field, just being yourself, and acting a fool.

Another joy able activity is band. Band can be a enjoyable activity by showing who you really are through music. Music is always a big part of somebody or something. The reason why is they can express them selfs through music. Some examples can be, when your trying to explain yourself to somebody, you can do that by using music. Such as, find a song that you think tells people of you the most and tell them if you want to get to know me listen to this song.

F5D2D8C81370,"Cellphones should be allowed because that might help students to communicate with their parents if they have any kind of emergency while they are in school. It would be helpful for students to find any kind of information on internet when they forget their computers or other devices that they might use as a resource to find information. Another reason is that students will have the advantage to use their cellphones while they are in the middle of the class, and it means that those schools trust students that they use their cellphones properly during class and they are proving to others schools that student can be trusted to use their cellphones during classes. Students also can give an example to other students that cellphones are little machines that help us in everyday lives, and they also might be giving advice to students in how they can be benefited from chance that the school provides to them.

On the other side why cellphones should not be allowed in schools is because schools think that students will not use their cellphones in a right path, and they will become more addictive to their cellphones where social media it's included. Most of the population have shown that a big percent of the population use their cellphones to spend their time in social media, whether is Facebook, Twitter, and Instragram. Another percent of the population spend their time in YouTube which that YouTube brings us some advantage and disadvantage. The advantage might be the tutorials that can help us to find information, how to fix something that you are capable to repair, and how to provide some skills from something that you like. The disadvantage might be that people might spend too much time watching video games or a new episodes from their favorite comics characters. Another reason to not use cellphones in school is because when there is a fight between two students, they start to take pictures or videos of the fight rather than prevent and called anyone who can help.

Most of the student will agree to have cellphones in schools because some of them use their cellphones in a right path and some of them do not. For those who use their cellphones in a properly way will say that cellphones are going to help them more than what teachers expect. Some of this students also will help them to find whatever meaning of a word that they do not understand. There are going to be some students who speak different language as their first language and it is very helpful to have cellphone while they are in school. For example some of the students who speak Spanish and they do not understand what the word say, they directly go to their cellphones and translate the word. Then they start to use it in some sentences to challenge themselves and improve their English. Those students who agree to have cellphones in school and do not accomplish the rules in how to use their cellphones properly, they will be playing around while they are in class, listen to music, and probably they will be texting with their friends. For some students will be annoying to have cellphones in class because it is going to be a distraction even if they are not using their cellphones.

From other perspective teachers might believe that is wrong to have cellphones in class, whether they are using it in a proper way or not because they might believe that it's a distraction for every students, and even if they are good students they will use their cellphones while teachers are explaining some important information. They also believe that some of them will use their cellphones to finish homework that is not for their class and will cause that students will not be paying attention in what the teacher is saying. Teachers also say that students will be texting in class and some of them playing video games and then when they tell them to put their cellphones away, they do not obey and some of them insult the teacher. Some teacher do not bother them if a student have a cellphone or not because they think that as long the student is doing his homework and classwork, they are going to be fine.

I believe cellphones should be allowed in schools, but under supervision of the teachers and principles. One of the reason why I believe that should be allowed is because cellphones are very useful and helpful for me in many ways. In my situation I speak Spanish as my first language and when I do not understand a word I go to my cellphone and I translate the word and then I try to understand what the word means. I also use my cellphone when I do not have my computer with me, and I do my classwork with my cellphone, and then I turn my work in. But some students do not understand when they have to use their cellphones and when I see students listening to music it does distracted me because I am trying to concentrate in what the teachers is explaining because If I don not pay attention it is hard to understand later on. I also see how teachers get mad when a student do not obey when they have to put their cellphones away, and then the student start to argue with the teacher. I strongly agree that school should allow students to have cellphones because it does provide a lot of advantages. ",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0

F66B2BAB7E4C,"Do we choose our own behavior or is it controlled by other influences. Well it all has to depend on the type of person you are. For example if you are somebody who gets influenced by other people then you are going to act like those people. And usually those people are bad influences, but if you are somebody that chooses to be who they are then that is really who they are. And mostly it is to be nice to others, and those are some reasons why it can go either way, but for me i personally think you have a choice to be who you desire to be without any influeces.

When you get to be who you want to be life is easier. You are going to be true to yourself and people will have respect for you. And many people all over the world are scared to be themselfs, and would rather get controlled by other people. And because of those type of people they spread that nagative influence off to other people that get controlled easily. But in the end it depends on who you hang around with.

Choosing the way you act is very important not just for you but for your future. Because your future is what matters at the end of the day. And because of that reason is because if you want to find a good job you have to be respectful and kind. But if you didn't have a good attitude then nobody won't hire you. It's reasonable too, because nobody wants a bad attitude person in their jobs.

Many people who have chose their characters have been successful because of it. And cause they have confedenced they can achieve anything they want in the world. And all that just because they went on to be themselfs. Meanwhile those who have been influenced by others have been stuck like that their whole lifes.

Depending on what type of influences they get, because some are good and they get to high places in life.

So at the end of the day as long as you choose something that is good for you and won't take you to bad places you will be great in life. But unfortunally it usually ends in bad places for those who are weak and would rather take influences by others who are in bad situations. And thats why for me it is better to choose to be yourself then to follow others. But if you are somebody that likes the influences then choose people who are good. That is how i see it in my eyes.     ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
F6AA88DC9ACA,"Although it may seen that ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" it actually right. But having something that you master it doesn't mean that trying something new you would failed. But giving up it's what would cost you to never grow, for example changing your life style by eating right and going to the gym is not going to be easy but you still going to give it a try. The reason why is that we want to challenge our self in a new environment that we never thought our self would be challenge our self in. Another reason would be that trying something new mean that we are looking for something that we would enjoy or like.

For example we teach our self how to cook but we know that we never knew how to cook but that doesn't mean we are not going to give it a try. That why we try new things because we want to challenge our self in a situation that we never knew that we could solve it or give up. Another reason is that we love trying new things because we are curious if we can master it another example would be is raising a kid wondering if we got everything and teaching them what is right and what is wrong. That what we love trying new things to see if we can do it or not. That what is more important trying new things and see if we can master it because we are capable of doing thing not a computer can't do and that it trying to learn new things.

We can master anything in our way because we are willing to find out if we can do this, if can not fear it, if we got this, give our self ideas that anything we do it possible when we put our mind it nothing can't stop us. For example we got our freedom from England long time ago, we ended slaves, and we ended racism which was big in the United State. Those are the reason why we can master things even if they are hard to master but we do it for a reason, and the reason is that we love to try new things even is bad but every challenge we are giving, we master them. But there is no dough we would failed those challenge that the world has giving us. Mastering is a challenge that is difficult because there is in our lifetime were we give up and we don't want it anymore. Were our mind and our body just doesn't want it, doesn't keep trying, at some point we start calling our selves looser, quitter.

We bring ourselves down because that how we punish ourselves without physical pain but emotion pain. In our life time that we have live in this earth the most pain that brought us down was emotional pain when we give up in life and we haven't master it. That is the big challenge that we haven't try to complete because it has beating us since the beginning that we are born we haven't control our emotion and that is the challenge that we haven't master it.

For that we have issues that we aren't able to figure it out because it's hard for us to figure what make us mad ,sad, happy, but people who has master it because they did give it a try and they successfully master that does emotions that give us hard time in life. Those people are therapy who want to understand does type emotion because they want to help those people who doesn't understand why they react like that.

That what make us to try new things in life because we are curious about what interest us as human being and see if can master it so ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered keep trying new thing that you would be able to do and get your attention to it "".",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,3.0
F72B0C4DB804,"In today's world we accomplish many things by being active, and doing them. If we would like to achieve or accomplish something we have to be dedicated and actually try not just be inactive because this awesome life we have if full of amazing experiences.

Many of us go to high school, or have jobs that we to attend and we are expected to try our best which would benefit us. Being inactive or not doing something right could lead to getting fired or failing in school which is why inactivity is known for negative results. The way we accomplish is not on how smart we are, or what people tell us to do is on if we are willing to try and keep on doing it. In the other hand inactivity may give you the time to rest at home, catch up on things but it wouldn't get you nowhere because your not being productive. For example, if your trying to get a job theres always competition for that position, the manager might want to pick the other person simply because his resume, he has involve himself in way more things like clubs and also because his ability of proving hes way better than the other person. Which is why its all about doing something so you can succeed in life rather than just sitting there and then later having the time to have fun.

Lastly, the best feeling of accomplishing something is the reward, or enjoying what you have earned. For example, I am expected to do many things around the house like cleaning, feeding the dog, and even babysitting. Even though sometimes I dont want to do it, I end up accomplishing more than what I have to do because I am the type of person that likes being known for accomplishing things around the house and then having to enjoy that feeling of my parents being proud of me. Being inactive wouldn't result in a positive result to many people including me because you arent gaining anything from it. Im sure everyone loves that deep feeling when you have done something right and you get something out of it. Not many people know how wonderful it is if we are always doing something and how it can really benefit you, even on the smallest things.

In conclusion, people should consider always doing something even if it's something small because anyone can tell you being inactive isnt the way to live life or be. After all, the accomplishments you earned will really show off in the long run thanks to always doing something.       ",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0
F72B3EE2E414,"In some occasion you feel weary or oppress to think about that you have to take high school during 4-years when you know that you can do in 3-years? Some school districts are thinking is this wonderful ides to offer a programs to the students that they can graduate in 3-years, the school districts should be approve the idea to graduate in 3-years because it will be so helpful to the students to feel more motivate to graduate early, the students will use the other year to work and make money to pay some par of their career, and the students can enter and start college one year early .

The students will feel more motivate to graduate early becasue many students that come from middle school they really took class of high school like Algebra 1, Geometry, Earth Science, History 1 ect, they can easely graduate and 3-years. I have two brothers older than I my brother that is 20-years-old he graduate in 3-years he miss only one class, but he take during summers because the school have the programs to high school students graduate in 3-years.

Also some school districts don't offer this program to graduate in 3-years and the students lose their motivation to graduate and who want to go to school just for one class a whole year, what happed if a student miss only one class to graduate in 3 year,but the school districts don't have the programs and the student have to come for a whole year just for want class like my older brother that is 29-years-old he only miss one class to graduate in 3-years but the school from California did not have the programs to leave him graduate in 3-years it was so bad for him and a lot of students past the same thing.

The student will able to use the other year to work and make money to pay a part of their career, we know that a lot of students don't have parents that can pay for their career because is a lot of money that they have to pay for a career, this year off will be so fundamental to the students who don't have the help enough to pay their career. During this year they can work and make money and have the opportunity to enter a college and be some one in life.

The students who are a school don't have the time enough to get a work outside and pay their career through a work. This is why a lot of students who graduate from high school don't take a career because they don't have the money to pay it, or their parents don't have money to help them, I have a lot of friends and family who finished high school but they did not take a career because they did not have the money enough to pay it, and what happed if you want to take a career, but you don't have the money enough to take it.

In some cases occur that when the student finish they high school in 3-years they start college one year early, or they start to work to make the money for it, they can finish their career more younger , we know that some career take like 6 or 8 years it will be so long , but have finish high school one year early will be so helpful for the students life.

Some students feel weary when they are taking 4-years of high school, they don't even have time to think about what they want to be, which career they want to take. The students don't have the time enough and this is why some students take wrong career and is very harmful for their life.

In conclusion, all school districts should be allow to offer the programs that high school students can graduate in 3-years, some school districts want the traditional four years, they think that is so helpful for the students, but they are wrong because the traditional four years cause a graduate decrease and many students go to school just for one or two classes, in the future if all school districts approve the programs to students can graduate in 3-years. Many students will be taking their career in college some one starting one year early, and other making the money during the year off to pay their career.

F747581D0782,"Many people believe that the infulences from others make us change on who we are, I believe that. Growing up we all had good and bad infulences at school, home, or in any other place. As a kid, every little thing you see or hear; you copy. Thats why you have to be careful what happens around kids, because it may affect them later on in life.

For an example, when parents argue infront of there kids its tramatizing and they may learn from that. Once there all grown up they can either be better then there parents or exactly the same or even worse, all because they were influenced by there parents arguments. Its not only just the arguments but when parents are abusive towards each other or when parents hit there childern, even the use of drugs, it will affect the child later on. Kids believe that because someone else did it, its okay for them to be able to do it too; and thats not right.

As a parent, it is very important to talk to your childern at a young age about the right way and the wrong way. Every parent wants the best for their child, they dont want to see them make misakes or anything. As a teenager we think its annoying or we think they dont understand the way were feeling, but thats not true. They give us advice and ground us when we do the wrong thing because they don't want us to go through any of that again. They were once teenagers too and they already went through what were going through. They just want the best for us, because half of the time they couldn't be succesful and they want you to be able to grow up and have the things they were not able to get you.

Another example could be the different types of infulences at school. Theres always gonna be the good kids and the bad kids, you just gotta see which side is gonna lead you into a better future. The good influences will want the best for you, for you to continue school, to not do drugs, to not do anything ilegal, ect. On the other hand, the bad kids will want you to ditch school, do drugs, do ilegal things, because as to them its all ""fun"". It may seem fun but there are consequences when you do the wrong thing.

As a teenager you already have to have an idea on what you wanna do later on in life. Half the teens don't know, because there stuck in a world where it invloves, parties, alcohol, drugs, sex, ect. When your stuck in a world like that, its very hard to get out. Being influenced by friends is very easy. Of all the times you guys hang out and everthing, it starts to change you; from being well influenced or bad influenced. perperssure is the reason alot of us take the wrong lane in life. Your friends can convince you of doing something then your going to want to keep doing it, even if you didn't like it, because you dont wanna seem as a boring person, you dont want your friends to leave you on the side. You can even be the reason why someone choosed the wrong lane. Even if you changed the way you are someone else is still suffering because they were influenced by you.

Majority of the time people regert the things they did in the past. They regert being infulenced that way, wishing they could have listened to the good, but sadly you can't change the past. Thats why its important to know exacty what were doing, to listen to the people who are telling us to do the right thing. we might not wanna seem boring but once we have an actual future, you will see that all the bad infuence wasn't worth it.

We are influenced by others, and we choice to become that person. Think today and make the decision to become someone better, don't follow the negative because it all leads to a bad ending.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5
F75D6E5CCE78,"Imagine how life would feel like when you can't have your favorite food at your favorite spot in school? would it even be fun to go to school or not. About a week or two ago i went to Panda Express to grab some food on my way home but at the time that I got there, I asked to get some white rice with some orange chicken but the workers told me they have changed their menu a little bit so i can't have some,at that point i fell so sad because that was the only spot that sold some in town. I think the change of the school menu would be a bad idea because,it will make students leave the school ground to go get some food in a illegal way,it would also bring some money problems in school and it would also make some students keep on empty stomach during the school day till they get home to prepare some food.

secondly,If students leave the school ground to go get some food in a illegal way andthey never came back, this would leave the parents worried because since the principal decided to change the menu they would have a reason for leaving school ground. Mr. principal i would be happy to tell you to leave the menu like how it is because it would make some students get in trouble and a lot of incidents will happen when they leave.0nce a bad incident happen out of the school ground,the principal would be responsible for all the damages caused when they left, keeping the old menu would be a good idea but we don't want our accidents and school detentions to increase.

In addition to this it would cause some money problems because if students are going to have to eat healthy then how would they gain more money easily to support the school when they are in needs of something. This is some of the way you can make more money so, Mr principal if you decide to change it the school is going to have to shut down at a point because when is no money to operate the school and pay the teachers and custodians they would have to leave their job and get a better one and once everyone one is gone there would be any teachers to teach the students. Mr principal because of this reason we should keep the old menu so that students and teachers can enjoy their selves in the school.

Therefore if the principal end up using the healthy menu this will led to some students getting sick because they will have to leave their stomach empty and they can't have what they want. This will cause a protest in the county because they supposed to eat what they like, and what the cafeteria think will be good for them to eat. In case of this of this reason the teachers will teach for no reason because the student are so focused on going home to eat what their mom or dad have prepared waiting for them,so if the principal wants them to focus in class then he is supposed to give them what they like.

In conclusion i think leaving the old menu would be a good idea because if the principal wants the students to try to improve in their class then he should leave it. Therefore if the students wants to add th healthy menu on it then he should let them vote on it whether they agree on what he is saying but i would say leaving the old one should be the best for the students.

Some people are old and want's to retirement that may get a opportunity to the other to have chance to get a job. It's really helpful when people support the other that will help everybody also, that will help the government to give more opportunities and create communities from different culture. To mix communities from many culture that help to have a people who have different job.

Government have to support the people to accomplish something to help other people. Many communities today serve a different jobs at that way many people can work if they have extra time from their day. However,students are very important element to this plan and they have the future in their hand. Schools and students can help to crate a activity for the any student who interested to work with this activity. Peoples from around the world who have many different idea how to create an activity or a community.

I had to go through many steps in getting the equipment that I needed. Also I needed to figure out all of the techniques of a camera, through all of that their has always been times where I failed to complete my task. Either their were problems with my camera or with my lighting just problems that I didn't know how to function well enough. Well with all of that I learned from my mistakes now, I know of what and not to do with my camera. I'm still learning new techniques since I started about a year ago, I'm still somewhat new but I plan to do this for a couple years and make a career out of it

That's why failure is a key part to success, if you don't learn from your mistakes how will you learn. For example, when I was in middle school my teacher always picked on me in class the reason behind it was because I didn't play my instrument the right way.

In my opinion, if the school created a after school homework club, nobody will come. Students can be lazy and do not want to do their homework. There are many other ways to help students improve in their behavior and achievement.

Homework is just a way to reinforce the main study. If the Principal decides to establish this ""Club,"" it will make the homework easier. Homework is to reinforce the main idea of studies, if they make it easier, then what will be the point of homework.

The issue on this prompt is that positive attitude is the key to success in life. Even if you do not feel well, we need to show a good attitude to people. A positive attitude is always important in our life.

Show a positive attitude when you are in school or work is really important, to any place that we go always be respectful with people. I agree with this statement as a result that if we want to achieve our goals, first thing that we need to do is always be with a good attitude to everything. The importance of attitude is that people will treat you, like the way you speak to them.

What people like teacher, students, and doctors achieve is as a result that they were success in life to achieve what they are now. These person always were with a positive attitude to achieve what they want to do. Sometimes depend on how our personality looks like, people evaluate ourselves.

Like I said to triumph in life, we need to obey life lesson. Sometimes we learn the importance of attitude from another person. Positive attitude teach us to appreciate life, as a result that some people can not have education. some people that do not have attitude they never go to school, as a result that they don't think positive.

Because gym is the most fun class I have this year these are some examples of why I like gym. the first reason why I like gym is because during the warm up we are aloud to talk to our friends while we are walking. Also another reason why is when we finish doing our warm up we get to play games or do fun activities. the last reason why is we could also go outside to do games or activities when it is nice outside.

The first reason why I enjoy the beginning of gym is because you can walk around the gym and talk to your friends.

. And not have to wait to talk till lunch to talk all you want. But the main reason why I like that part of gym is because I love to talk even though at sometimes I got nothing to talk about. Another reason why is that I love hanging out with my friends or to hear about there problems. talking helps you feel much better and lonely so i think that talking is fun and important at the same time.

then the other reason why I like gym is because we get to play fun games or activities sometimes. Because I like getting distracted from stuff with something fun like a game or activities. The fun games could help someone feel relaxed and forget about something that might be worrying them. another reason why I like that is because l think it is much more fun than having to be in health, Doing the pacer or doing push ups. But other people do enjoy those stuff but I highly dislike doing those things. but the games could help you get some exercise and keep you having fun the gym class instead of being bored and exercising

The last and final reason why I like gym is because sometimes we go outside when the weather is nice to do activities or other stuff like that. I like going outside because I like it when it is nice and warm out to be doing exercise. It is also nice to be out there and be racing or playing soccer and maybe football. But it is also big outside to be holding all of the gym classes together and the teachers could teach together. And you could also do much more outside even though some people dont like going outside I think it is much better because their is much more space and more fresh air.",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0
F9111CF0A009,"one topic that is that is frequently debate today is'' four-day school week.'' Some people think is better for students, so they can have three days free to do their homework and have a par time job. I believe that students don't need four-day school and extend the school day two hours, because some students can't work after school or do our homework, students can't have time for our families in afternoon. and students can't have three days off and after come and they will not remember what they learn last class.

one reason why is students can't work after school or do their homework because students will come tire after ten hours on school. student will come late and they will come just to have a dinner and sleep. students will come so late that they will not be able to do their homework on time do to no time for them. students need five day to do what they normally do they will have time for homework, have a dinner, and sleep well everyday. and the next they they can come ready to learn more and enjoy the school hours.

another reason why is that students will not have time for their families. students having ten hours in the school come tires and they don't want to talk not event with their families. Some students come straight to the bed and their families don't have time to talk to them or give an advice. Some families have the tradition to go out like five or six at clock but students will not be able to go out with families and friends. that's why students need the normal days to study they have a routine that they follow.

The final reason why is that students can't take three days off and after come they will not remember what they learn last class. Some teachers choose that Monday is a really good day to start with a test or quiz students will not remember what they learn after three days with out study. Sometimes students are learning a topic really important and they understand but when they come after three days off they will not remember anything. If students will have three days off they will work these days and when they come back to school after three days of they will not be able to remember everything they will forget. students need the five days to study how suppose to be.

as you have read four-day school is not good idea because students will not have time to study do their homework and enjoy with their families. If students have four days school, ten hours at day students will be tire and they will not here the same routine that they use to have. Only when students have the normal school days they will have time to learn more and focus more. and have the best time as possible with family. ",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
F91EFD0443E6,"Have you ever though of people who use technology has limit their communication to others? Nowadays people who use technology are consistent spending their time on electronic device. Technology has a negative impact on human lives due to their daily routine.

The first reason is people's communication skills will decrease over time. Spending a lot of time on technology without comminicating with others, will affect your communication skills. Therefore, talking to someone who you haven't talked with for a while can be awkward. This shows that understanding between two people might have consequence and will be not accurate than it should be.

The second reason, people who use electronic device are unlikely aware of the surroundings. For example, people who are walking in street using headset or earbuds on that cover their ears is a bad choice. This shows a sign of danger, because you won't be hearing anything. People who are aware of surrounding are more safe to cross a street and communicate with people who are passing by. This shows a negative effect of people who block their earing has higher chance to get into a accident.

Some people say that technology helps them communicate by commenting on a website which is true, but that is not important because the person will be not always active and able to comment back on time, whenever they are on. If you are communicate in person you can read the person's mood. You can get a faster respond than waiting for the person to comment back. In this way is more accurate and able to trust each other more by communicating in person that you have meet or have not meet before.

The final reason is library is more accurate than reading books online. For example like reading online recommendation is not always accurate because of the people's preferance. You can ask the librarian for recommendation and librarian also assist you whenever you need help. You can read on your device but it is limited because of the battery. Unlike books, have no battery which means it doesn't have any limit. This shows reading on books is a better than reading on a device.

In conclusion technology had a negative effect on people lives. People should be aware that around them and spend their time in their technology on a necessary way. There should be a limit of how much time you are using on technology. Is better to communicate in person and don't wear anything that cover your ears while talking to someone. This affect our daily lives, so limit the time you use in technology.",3.5,3.5,4.5,3.0,3.5,4.0
F93A5B7E57AF,"Being ourselves in a world strongly influenced,manipulated,and corrupted by people. Make a big difference in our lives .This also make us to know, who we are. Because we should not change our personality,our cultures,and how we were educated.

Although being like other people make us to socialize easily. Nevertheless, we should not change our personalities. Because our personality is what help us to become our dreams in reality. For example there is a case of two guys who were twins one of them was nice all the time, and the other rude because he was influenced by his friends all the time having even a weird personality, that nobody liked. They attended to the same school their last year in high school, the one who was rude had many problems and one of those problems took him to death, however, his brother who was upset by his death, never stopped being a nice guy and having a great personality,he graduated from high school and attended to one of the best universities in the United States. Additonally having a real personality without any change help us to be more honest with ourselves. I remember last year in my math class my teacher told us to check our assigment by ourselves. In the honor system and I only got six of the ten questions right which was a sixty percent I told her the true and after she checked she gave points extra, she said that I deserved for being honest. In fact our personality gaves us an attitude and help us to be honest with ourselves.

Another important reasons for which we should keep being ourselves is because we should not lose our culture. Because our culture makes us special and different to the rest. For example there is a story of a girl who moved from Colombia to Canada where she always practiced her culture even made a club with her traditions that colombian people in Canada visited,so she became famous really fast and made a lot of money. Additionally it is important to keep our culture in anywhere because the culture is an important legacy that children adapt from their parents. One amazing example of this is Leonel Messy a great soccer player, from Argentina, who has been living in Spain for a long time. However he is still practicing his culture and does not change his accent thanks to his family which made him to beloved by all Latin America. Therefore keeping practice our cultures will make our families, and others to be proud of us

Also it is important to be ourselves, to show how we were educated. Due to our education is what define by itself how we threat other people. For example on the newspaper was written a story of a guy who teached a long time ago English to his students in a particular way giving them candies when they participated,he never changed his method and all his students got good scores always. Actually our education is most the most need in our life. For example my uncle graduated from high school and ten years after that. He attended to college and the university where he studied languages now he has a family an really good life,but he never stopped being the nice man he was and still being today.

in conclusion,we must continue to be ourselves in anywhere, anytime to have a real and nice personality. That will open doors to become our dreams true. Also to keep our culture alive for the next generations. Making our families proud of ourselves. Finally it is important to be ourselves because it shows the way we were educated. Because a good education brings a good life. Therefore being ourselves bring so much good things to our life, that we should not change by the influence of other people.

To me each student actually should participate in one or more activity. Because it helps you mentally and emotionally,and helps you get collage credits and be healthy. Many research has proven many reason why people should do at least one activity to help you benefit in life .Research has proven people who have done sports most likely wont have heart attacks or won't even have breathing problems or mostly any issues.

How it helps you benefit in staying fit or healthy or both is well playing a sport can really help you lose weight .help you be more active like for example playing baseball,basketball,track or even being a cheerleader and many other sports can help you a lot more then you think, because research has proven a lot that people who are more active are people who are benefiting from it a lot .

Another way it helps you is emotionally is because you get distracted and you dont think about the stuff that is stressing you all the time. you know you have a break from what is keeping you stressed because you are having fun. for example of having a way to distract yourself isn't just sports its working with other like helping out the councilor, helping out in making the yearbook, helping around in the school and not being just about you when your just thinking all about you well that is the problem. Instead of have all the students separated you can put all of the students each in different groups everyday that way people get to know each other and have fun .

collage credits also matter and playing a sport or just helping around the school would look amazing on a collage application . Extra activities would make a lot more collages be interested in you and most likely be interested in giving you a scholarship. You mostly get into a great collage because all the extra credit actually helps you get noticed by a lot of collages because they aren't just looking for people who have good grades they are looking for people who actually are more outstanding. Like grades are great, but how can you handle being nice . Have certain thing taken care of before anything . well how you take certain things serious because if you can't take your own high school classes seriously how are you going to take care of your classes in collage .Also collages are seeing how independent you are, and how well you do around others .

Having all the students do one or more extracurricular activity will benefit them so much of a lot of reasons why actually so you should try it out .Also because it doesn't hurt you to give it a try . I agree fully with the principal because not everything is a lot what you want you have to just go with it .",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
F9D0974B3AF7,"I disagree about extending school because,Parents might want to spend time with their kids after school on a regular day after school and if school was extended parent might have already gone to work by the time you get home. Parents might have done an appointment with a doctor right after a regular day at school,but if the time extended at school the doctor might have already closed. kids would want to get out of school to talk with their friends or have fun doing what they like best. The teachers might not get paid more then a normal day at school. Teachers should get paid more if school was extended. I would not like school to get extended because,I have more important things to do after school like taking care of my brother or take care of my dogs. My parents are never home and my older sister is. My parent tell me to help my sister clean the house after school but when i get home she never cleans until before my parents come, and if school was extended she would never clean the house and my parents would already be heading home. This is why i think school should not be extended. And the most important thing is that nobody wants to be in school.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
FA0619D6A0DF,"People may not agree, but we do pick our own character trait. There are also other people who when it gets to having their own character traits they can't, therefore they get influence by others. Yes, we probably were influenced by other, but we didn't use all their character traits. There's lots of people who try to be others but it always dose not work out. If you want to pop out like the others best chance is you being your true self.

To begin with, we've been creating our own character traits since birth. We all learned how to speak, and walk differently. Your first word were most likely ""Dada"", or ""mama"". You kept watching shows that kept you entertain, or was it the games that made it entertaining that kept you going. How'd you learn how to walk, were you thought by your parents, or did you learn by yourself. it was either your parents were walking you, or you stood up and took your first steps.

In addition, you never stay young, you're always growing, our parents always wish we wouldnt grow. But it's part of life, now you're in the stage where time gets hard. Being a teen is mixed emotions, as like mentally, and physically. Times gets rough, you're struggling in school, or at home. You're having problems with friends, or family members. Being a teen is never a struggle nor negativity. You're learning what you need to improve and what you don't, you're helping yourself out. Guide yourself and continue making new character traits.

Finally, you see everything different, there's more responsibility, more weight to your shudders. your an adult, getting ready to pay bills and more. you've came a long way, youve been through ups and down. You've learn so much, use your knowledge, and continue to expand it. Do what's best for you and not for others. Use your character traits that you've learn and explore whats in front of you.

You are who you are, you choose how you live, how you move, and how life will be. Yes there are struggle in life but it doesn't mean stop and dont expand. have your character traits to help you, to guide you. Yet we're in a new year where people try to be other people, people try to be who they aren't. It's better to be yourself, than being fake to yourself. all these character traits that you've made, you worked, you used. It defines who you are and what you can do in life.

FA0A1D6FEE25,"I agree with Ralph Waldo's quote "" To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you somthing else is the greatest accmplishment. In todays society everyone wants to be part of the wave to whatever is popular. People always go the extra mile to impress other people even if they have to change their style or the way they act. It's hard to be yourself in todays society so those who can do it have accmplished something great. Being yourself is better because then you'll find your real friends.

Students in Middle School and High School for whatever reason want to be cool. They think doing drugs, breaking rules and being disrespectful to others is cool. When they get home they're a different person. They're respectful, follow all the rules and don't do drugs because thats the way they are raised, They're being themselves. That shows the impact of what people consider being cool is.

Some students are at the wrong spot at the wrong time and start hanging out with the wrong group of people to be cool. This is important because they could be offered drugs or be offered to skip class. The students would say yes because they want to be cool knowing very well never to do it. This shows what could happen to a student who are trying to be cool. when they know to stay in school and never do drugs because that won't help your education it would only slow it down.

For example one of my friends was skipping school and doing lots of things he wasn't supposed to be doing. He thought he was cool and told everyone. I guess you could say he got cool from it but in the long run he suffered. This is important because while him trying to be cool he ended up getting bad grades and getting kicked out of school. The school gave him one more chance and made him go to the carrer center where students who fail usually go. This shows what could happen when you try to be cool.

Being yourself is the best thing you can accomplish because you wouldn't worry about most things other students wear or say. You would go further in life being yourself and becoming something you want to become. If your don't want to become a doctor and want to be a car machanic then that what you do. Being yourself would make you more happy then trying to fit in. ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

I believe they should never loss enthusiasm, because one day they can be success,learn how to no give up, and that can help you with your goals.

First, i should no loss enthusiasm, because all people have failure, but if you never loss enthusiasm one day you can be success in my life i had failure,but i never give up, becuase i know one day i going to became something better. when i come to united state was hard for me for the lenguage, and learn different things, but the most difficulty in high school was to learn english, but i never loss my entthusiasm, and now i'm about to see everthing that i have done, becuase this year is my graduation.

Second reason, is the people can learn how to no give up, becuase if you have failure thas how you learn that you need enthusiasm to keep going everyone would have failure in their life,but as i'm telling you keep going one day you would see why you have try hard,but you always have to failure first, and then you learn have to no loss your enthusiasm.

The final reason is, that can help you olot in the future with your goals, and you can be success in my oppinion people dont like to failure, and they give up. I telling you that sometime i give up,because life is hard you can failure and give up, but never loss your enthusiasm, becuase that is the most important thing to be success, and that can help you with your goals. You have to has the enthusiasm to be something better, and make good choices

As you have read you see that this is important, some people thing that they can not do it, but everyone can do it you always need to have enthusiasm for everythings to be success i agree becuase thats how my life go, but i always have enthusiasm to be success this is very important, becuase this can hel you in the future to be something better never give up becuase things better are about to come.",3.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0

FAAFFC983E47,"The majority of the students take about four years to graduate and go to the college, but also there are students who decide to finish the high school in tree years or as soon as possible. The question is, why are they trying to finish the high school earlier that the other ones?. A few people decide to finish the high school because they have other kind of goals to accomplish like travel or enlist to the Army etc.

In some situations this people aren't able to take electives courses like, Graphic Design, Culinary arts, Earth space, Mathematics, Health AP or Driving class. Whatever of this ones or others ones they can't enjoy them. In other situations this students take nigh school or summers school or both.

In my personal opinion take nigh school is really tired because when you leave the school yo have about one hour to get ready and go to the other school to take your course.

In other way, there are students who do not have support by their parents to finish the high school, and that is why they decide to finish early to have more time and find a job to support themselves. Even if they have a half time job, is not enough.

Enlist to the Army is a good idea for some people especially for high school students, they have a conversation with their parents to have the aprovation to do three years in the high school and get a career into the Army.

Some guys also want to finish early because they want to go to the college in other country or because they want to travel and have a extravagant life, this are the most common situations of why students decide to graduate during three years, but is better that dropped the school in the last year if they have the normal school ( four years).

I think that this programs that the district offer is good for those who have the potential to do it and finish the high school as soon as possible, and they need to know the probability to do not have or be able to have elective courses or Generic_School. I know about some guy who decided to take this program offered by the schools districts. He told me that is hard because while he was in the school he also studied for the exams of nigh school and he had courses really bored and after that, he took summers school all of this on his freshman year, I think that the only need to be constant interest and keep a good grade to success.

In my opinion take the traditional four year is better because you can enjoy of many things like the clubs in the school, community service or even participate in a sport team in the school like soccer, football, tennis or basketball. this things is what make a school awesome. in the traditional four year, you can pick electives courses that you really like it and do not make you bored. Also in the traditional four year you can talk to you consular to have Generic_School. But when you take the tree years you can not enjoy about you favorite things.

Take the tree year since my point of view is bad but could be great for other ones who has different things to accomplish, I dont have rush to finish early, and that is why I think about the tree years and the traditional schedule for the four years.                   ",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0

People's character traits are formed by influnces beyond our control because the enviroment that we live in takes a huge part on how we are, who we are, and how we act, and because of people like our parents that have guided us and influenced us throughout our whole lives, and while some people say that a person is able to choos who they are or control their character traits, the majority of the people in society live by other people's influences.

The enviroment that a person lives in takes a huge part on someone's character because; their culture, their religion, and the people they surroud themelves with, always have an impact on someone's traits; for example, a private christian school student might not have the the character traits as a public school student because the enviroments are way different. In conclusion people's traits are controled by influces beyond our control because people is always getting influenced on the daily regardless of what envioment they're in.

People like our parents are responsable for most of the character traits we have since they have been with us our whole life. They guide us everyday, and they teach us what is right and what is wrong. Most of the kids in this world look up to their parents or use them as a role model, and that controls a huge part of our character traits. In conclusion our traits are formed by incluences out of our control because our parents, who have been with us our whole life impact us every day with thei lessons.

Some people say that a person is able to control their character traits or choose who they are, because they are alone and they probably don't like talking to people or learning from people so; therefore they don't get influenced by anyone , so they start forming their character and they start being who they are base on only what they do.

Most of the people in this world are influenced by the outside since most poeple go to work everyday, go to school everyday, and talk to people everyday, thay are always getting something out of someone, it could be an advice or a lesson. I don't think many people are able to control their character traits on these days with social media, and things like that going on.

In concluison our character traits are controled by influences we can't control because the enviroment with live in always has an impact on us, the people we surround ourselves with have an impact on us and society in general has an impact on us. Moving forward i think it would be good for people to keep being influnced by the outside because we will get to know how everything works, and no matter who we are influenced by there will always be someone that will tell is if it's right or wrong.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
FBC421A7BE79,"Generaly saying,people do accomplish more if we are always doing something.

in live if you don't want to do anything you will become blind to the society and be left undone because you have waste the day and time not doing accomplishing things with your live but focus on things that are not accomplishing your live. for example: playing video, twitter, face time, and snapshot. all these thing are waste your time all depends on the way it being use. and if you fall in that position of not accomplishing when you get older it's going to effect you. example: you will start rubbing,mudring because you didn't put your mind on accomplishing anything. it is also important to accomplish more. my reason for saying this is the more you do accomplishment the more you go farward in anything. for example; by making good grade in school, by being a good leader, and also helping people if they do needs help all these things you are accomplishing something. everybody do want to accomplish something in life but you have to work for it.

To be sucessful you have to accomplish everything in life. any people in this world today, have gotten good position for their accomplishment. i know, some time it's hard to do but like i said if you want to accomplish something in life you have to work for it. for example: like the brids we see today they have to go through a lot of stages. bruds cannot just be born and start to fly the same day they have to go through before they fly. so they accomplish their flyinh by process and it is the same as human we go through processes to accomplish things we want. our lives go by days and hours the day we see today will never return so why not accomplish somehting within that day because when that day is gone you have waste thime,and abilities to accomplish something.

lets be honest the world today need someone that never give up. it is amazing for some one to reward you for your accompishment. today many of us went to be a doctor,lawyer, and so on but, we are not putting the effort and time. one way to accomplish thing in live is this pay attention to things, learn from mistake using your time and effort if you found yourself doing this you are going to accomplish many thing. the reason why many poeple don't accomplish things is this they don't pay attention not willing to ascept their wrong doing and don,t use their time and effort. for example; i want to be a doctor i have to pay attention in biology class, read books, and also make good grade i'am accomplishing what are want to do because are do it constanly and i love it to so that give me more intrest in doing it.

therefore, to make the world a better place we have to do better talking by mouth and not putting to action it don,t work so if you ready want to accomplish some thing in live you have to always do it never give up and always found your self doing something not playing arround be a better you for your tomorrow.

I reply i don't know he watch me and laugh you need; to discover your career now so you will get prepare for the future I said ok.

The issue is discovering your passion or career earlier can help you to discover and prepare for you goals in the future early.

I agree it is a good idea for student to commit their career because know or understand what you want to do in the first place can help you to discover what and what you good at or bad at and what you need to pay more atention on like for example you wanted to become an engineer you need to pay more atention on maths and science and now all your focus will be on that.

FIRSTLY

Know and understand what you want to be in life can bring you much more closer to your goal like understanding the question is part of the answer so understanding or discover your career can be a helpful thing towards your future for example: I want to be a teacher but i didnot know that i can't speak a good english and i don't now how to explain so that my student can understand me but i never knew about this until now and it too late for me to go back and discover a new career because am half away to graduate from high school.

SECONDLY

You can't do what they like but you can do what you like your passion can't be stop even by yourself not talking about other your love and determination can make you do it but that will only happen if you discover your career early and prepare for it for example: My passion for become an auto engineering increase every single day i just can't wait to be one because since when i was in middle school have discover my career my dream and i know i have passion for it have prepared and determine myself for it

After high school it will be too late for you to think about your career and what you want to become in future and beside in high school they prepare you and guide you towards your specific career and you not yet discover your career it will be a tough one for you out there example you don't like anything or you don't know what to do after high school and graduate without knowing what you gonna do out there your life will be at risk it just like you in a sea with a speed boat but you don't know how to ride it with a opportunity but you don't know how to used it

My Conclusion is know what you want to do because life is about time and when you discover your career earlier you will have more time to prepare and determine yourself if you really ready for it before is too late your career should discover earlier it can be helpful for student in future.

To have the knowledge of the deeper meaning inside the architecture, and the way to success through my creations. You should select me to visit and learn about architecture.

When I decided to create my dogs' house, I made it with things that I had in my home. I decorate the house, and the result was so pleasant. Another example is that I like draw.

FD48D4BB6F06,"Students would benefit from being able to atttend classes from home. First of all, this will let students be less stress from going to school and receiving their education. Students can also work at their own pace at home in a relaxing enviroment which I think works best. Lastly, this would give students more free time for themselves and choose whatever they want to do what they can't do during the day.

Most students around the United States dislike waking up early in the morning and having to take the long proccess of getting ready and parents yelling at them ""Wake up"" or ""The bus is going to leave you"". There are some schools that offer online classes that benefit students from going to school and taking the classes online. I think this would help all students from stress becasue you won't have to think about early morning wake ups. This would help students not having to deal with overloads of work stressing about ""where did I put my papers"" and losing valuable homework. This also helps with time management. Students won't have to go to school for more than 7 hours and be stuck in class sleep deprived and would just be at home taking there time with there classes online. Furthermore, this would help students getting into trouble at school and dealing with teachers about who's right and who's wrong.

In addition, students would benefit even more becasue they would work at there own pace. Students can take time by working in each subject at there pace and won't be rushed by and teachers or anybody. I think this is a great way for students to build self-indepence for the real world becasue they will be on there own and have to manage there time wisely and accordingly. I also think you can get more worked down where the you can choose a place at home or a nearby coffee shop where students don't have distractions. Students can also engage with other students if they taking the same materials and help each other out.

Moreover, this allows students to have more free time and social time to themselves. Many students these days want to have some change in there pockets and find partime jobs. This would allow students to either choose a job or a hobby they like to pursue during the day since they won't be physically at school. Most students can join a sport they like and also have plenty if time to condition and practice to get better.

In conclusion,

students would benefit from being able to atttend classes from home. I would reccomend many schools should have online classes for students who just dont feel school isnt where they can learn but at home they can enjoy there comfort and still excel. ",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0
FDCBCA9B0636,"Dear School Principal,

I believe that students should have cell phones in campus. If they have something they always wanted from a school. They'll be wanting to learn more. If there's a emergency somewhere where they cant get to the office immediately , they could use there cell phones to call other students to tell the teachers that there's an emergency. Parents won't be angry about this policy because they'll know that there children are learning in ways that they'll want to learn.

So, if they know that they can use there cell phones in school they wont be using it during class hours. Cell phones are really use full to students during school hours. It keeps them safe and will help there education in how they will want to learn. You should really reconsider to allow students to bring there cell phones to school. It will be helpful to them. Students will think that education is fun now. And If you really look at it there's not much time of break or free time. The only time they'll use their phones a lot is during lunch time.

I would like going to the Bahamas because the sea life there. I like watching animal shows to see all the different colors,patterns and different types of fish in the sea. I also like turtles because they walk slow and they look cool.

The first thing i would do when i arrive at the Bahamas is buy goggles then go to the beach and run in the water to find Memo and Dory. I would probably document everything so when i get back home i'll have a memory from when i was at the Bahamas. I enjoy watching colorful fish swimming in crystal clear water. I like when there are all types of colorful fish in groups and swimming together. I also like stingrays because some of them flop on water and it makes it look like they are flying.

There are also sharks for example bull sharks,blue sharks ,and mako sharks. I also like the coral because they come in different shapes,sizes and colors. The coral i like the most is the coral that the clown fish hides in. I would love to go on a cruse and see dolphins and stingrays. I would love to visit with my family one day.

I also like dolphins because they look cool when they jump out the water and they dive back in. It will be cool if i learn how to surf in the Bahamas because it fun to explain to your friends that the first place you learned to surf at is the Bahamas.

FE822B3E72FC,"On this time most the people had failures on their life, a failure is something that always gonna happen on the life. Some people get it on the good way and they make of each failure a lesson for their life , also a failure give to you the motivation that you need to do your best , each failure make you more stronger and make you be alert on your next step

Some people get the failures on good way when they learn about it. All the failures have a lesson for your life, the first reason why a failure give you a lesson is because. If you never do it wrong you will never learn about the failure. Second you learn about the failure when you made it before and you do again but now you do it good for example. If your teacher give you 10 days to do a presentation on your computer and, the first day you say i will do it tomorrow and you say the same the next day until a night before the day that you have to turn the work you start do it , and you don't have enough time and you get a bad grade. The next day it was a failure and you will learn about it because the next time you will do it on time.

A failure give to you the motivation that you need to do your best the next time. When you do something wrong for first time you feel bad and you want to do it wrong again , inclusively if it was a little mistake you don't want to and you got motivation. Most the people owners of big companies obtain motivation when they have a failure on a business, they don't give up they get motivation to do their best on the next business for example. You went to your work and it's your first day and your boss told you that you have to finish all of your signatures 10 minutes before the end of the day , and you finish it 15 minutes after , your boss can get mad and give you a warning and you have to get it like a motivation to do your best the next day and keep going.

Each failure make you more stronger and make you be alert on your next step. The failure coming and coming on ours life sometimes it come hurt and sometimes it doesn't, all of those make you more stronger, give you a lesson and make you be alert for don't get it mistake again. It make you more stronger means that you don't gonna feel weak again when you commit a mistake , also you gonna be alert and take your precautions on your next step for example. If you are on a team of soccer and you are the goalkeeper, and while you are talking with a friends , one of the other team hit the ball and make a score it was your fault. Your coach gonna scold you for it but you gonna be alert for the next time and you also gonna be more stronger because you learn about of your mistake.

The primer minister Winston Churchill had the reason when he said that "" success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" I think that if everyone doesn't have any failure on their life, they never know how hard can be a success person on this world. They never learn about their failure and maybe they don't encourage to the best on their jobs in conclusion all the people have more then one failure on their life but they make of it something good on their life.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5

However, some say school shouldn't offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because students wouldn't get enough knowledge at home, it's better in school.

Actually, students should be able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. First, Online is useful in many ways. Students can research the information, or students can watch video on YouTube. For example, Math, some students don't understand how to solve the equations, but they can watch the video and find more math learning. Also, English essays. last year, my English teacher told me to write an essay about the night by Eli Wisely. I researched him because I didn't know who he was at first, and I found his history in the holocaust, I read it. It was very tragedy. So, I wrote it down for project, and I found a lot information in the holocaust. It was useful finding information on Google.

Second, video conferencing is helpful. There is a website called Edubirdie. This website is use for teachers communicating with students for education. Students can spend time with teacher like 24 hours or depends on what time students chooses. Edubirdie helps students with essays, math problems, social studies, science, etc.. Also, I remembered when I had a final exam for chemistry, and the problem was I didn't learned anything from chemistry class. Because my teacher was horrible, I didn't learned anything from him. So, I searched to Edubirdie website and watched some videos of stochiometry problem and word problems. Then, I face timed a Chemistry teacher from Edubirdie. I spend like 10 hours with her. It helped me little bit. After that, I took the final exam and I barely passed the class with the D+. at least I passed the class and I'm happy with it.

In conclusion, schools should offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because it gains knowledge and helpful for future education.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5

The big idea about this is trust the students can not use their phone when ever if the students don't follow the rules you can stop phone use but, give it a try and see how well it works out for you but, make you do the right choice or have a vote for the whole school that's how it all work in the U.S. do what's best for your school.",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5
FF66DA76E15F,"Even though imagination is more important than knowledge, thinking in a creative way is better than learning something from somewhere. Yes, imagination is more important than knowledge because it's letting your brain think more about the things that make you happy the most. Also imagination is like thinking outside of the box (to me), but I try using imagination a little more than knowledge. Although knowledge is not as good, but some people prefer knowledge instead of imagination. Imagination helps me become more creative and open to myself because I let myself imagine, then let my mind speak free and be creative.

Becoming more creative and open is really good, knowledge does not give me the opportunities to do so. Knowledge does not let me be as more creative as when I'm imagining, therefore I have to start imagining. I think that imagination is a better way of saying art, because I'm thinking of things that may not even exist in this world. In that case, imagining is creative, artistic, and beyond, so that is why imagining something is better than knowledge to me. Imagination makes me passionate about what I want to do and accomplish it.

I've always dreamed of opening my own interior design company. That designs furniture,planing notebooks for office workers, etc, that are for houses, offices, and dorm rooms. All of that was because of imagination, I wanted to accomplish that when I graduate from college. Imagination doesn't just help me with what I want to accomplish it also helps me decide what I want to be when I grow up. Otherwise imagination would've not gotten us to where we are right now.

Finally, Imagination is something that brings people together like art and creative things. It also brings us joy and things that we don't really imaging on our daily bases. Although, knowledge is not important than imagination I still think that Knowledge can be used in someway and help me with something. Therefore I thing that imagination is more important than knowledge because it help me with my daily bases work at school, home, sports and all kinds of other things that I do.",3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0
FFDC4011AC9C,"""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" What I think about that quote is that you cant do your best in every problem. If your still stuck on what it even means like I was in the first few minutes of seeing that, It means that in every challenge you see in life there is always a way to try your best and get through that challlenge, dispite what your mind tells you because your mind is your biggest enemy you will ever face. I dont particularly agree with that quote jsut because in certain problems even if you try your best you will still fail or if you just dont want to do the problem or other people around you dont then you most likley fail to. What im trying to get at to this quote is that instead of being ""For every problem there is a chance for you to do your best"" it should be ""For every problem or challenge there is always a way to get thorugh it"". Here is a few examples: If your dying from old age and your deadline is going to be this week. Then just die you get around the challlenge by dying because in most relgions there is something called heaven so you can die and go to heaven. Another example: Facing a hard question, just guess!

FFED00D6E0BD,"Do you think that failure is the main thing for people consist on their goal's and success without lose their enthusiasm?

I agree with the important role that failure play in the pursuit of success in life because, I think failure is the main key to people reach their goal's because they need to have the idea that after failure came the success, secondly they need to be positive and have in mind what they want and how they want to reach their success in life, and last they have to be prepared for failure, and they have to be prepared to confront the failure because they need to keep in mind that not everything is going to be in the way they want, but at the same time they always need to have in mind that everything is possible with effort.

First, people need to have the idea that after failure came the success, because everything happens for a reason and if something goes wrong for certain reason in the moment when they try to success they need to accept things, and keep trying. They need to be really patience for example, when babies are trying to walk they fall many times but get up and they keep trying until they reach their goal which in this case is walk or, there have been many cases when people have car accidents and they lose the ability to walk that's something that does not stop them they keep trying even if take more than a year they don't give up because their goal is to be able to walk again, their goal is to be the person they used to be before they get in that car accident, and they just want to be able to keep doing all the stuff they used to do before all the tragedy happens.

Secondly, everything depends in how positive people is because, if they have a negative mind and always act like their goal's is something impossible to come true their not going to accomplish nothing because people need to have the idea that they can make true everything they want, they don't have to be thinking in failure cause the more you think the more afraid you get to encourage yourself to make thing's happen and they have to try every day to improve and look for the resources available to success in life.

Finally, they always need to keep in mind that there always would be a chance of failure and they have the right to be afraid but, that's something they need to live aside and they need to be focus on their goal,

they need to have the power to stop themselves whenever they want, and they have to be the ones to say to their self to stop when they think they already accomplish what they want but, they can't let people decide for them. Because sometimes people get jealous to see the other one's success in life and they try to guide people into failure.

In conclusion, there have been nothing that can't stop people to reach their goal's and success in life because everything is possible, people have to believe in them self and always be positive they always need to keep in mind that they are capable's of everything and they need to learn to not give up. In that way they would be able to do everything and be successful the key is always have and excellent attitude and be prepared for people to judge, and be prepared to failure and get up and make it see like their have been nothing wrong and keep going. They need to be positive in every movement they make and be positive in the way that everything is going to be exactly how the planned.",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5
