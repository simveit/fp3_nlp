003885A45F42,"The best time in life is when you become yourself. I agree that the greatest accomplishment, is when you be yourself in a world that constantly trying to make you something else. Because you make your own choices, you become more happy, and you respect others.

First, you make your own choices by being yourself. Becoming yourself means that you should be able to make your own choices and not be shy or afraid of what you're doing. Because you're defining yourself by doing those things that you want. Some people follow others, therefore, they don't make their own choices. People are afraid to make their own choice because they don't want to get rejected or be wrong. In this world, most of the teenagers act and follow the people who are strong and bullies. The reason they follow them and make the same choices they make, is because they're afraid that they will get beaten up and be left out. Personally when I came to the United States I used to follow other, because I thought they were amazing. But one day, I knew I was walking in the wrong path and I left them. Making your own choices makes you happy because you get to do what you like and what you want to do. It's hard to make your own choices, but one day you're going to have to make your own choices. The more you mature the more it will become easier for you to not be afraid of what you're doing and how other people are looking at it, because at the end of the day It's your life and you do what you think is right.

Second, You become more happy by being yourself because you make your own choices, You take responsibilities and you do whatever makes you happy. Also, some people act like they're happy while not being themselves, but matter of fact, they're depressed from the inside. Being yourself makes you more happy because you feel like you achieved something big. Also, Some religious kids who become themselves love everyone. In the bible it says ""Those who know God should love others, because God is love.""

Not being yourself will get you depressed because you don't do everything you want to do, but you do what others wanna do because you want to fit in. Some kids who come from a different country will do stuff they don't want to do just to fit in, because they don't want to be lonely. Some people are afraid they won't be happy because they would lose a lot of friends for being themselves, but they have to know that those people should be there for them and support them for what he's doing since it's his friends.

Lastly, Respecting others will gain them to respect you. Some teenagers like to make fun of others, not listen to what they have to say, and they like to beat kids up. Also some kids don't like to not listen to their parents, and that is also disrespectful. The bible says "" Honor your father and mother.""

If you respect your parents and listen to them, then they would trust you and not ask you lots of questions. Respecting other should be really important, because you don't want others to not respect you. Also, Some people are disrespectful because they were never respected. Important things to do to be respectful is, Listen to what the other person has to say, Stand up for them, Being friends with them Doing all of that will gain you respect and you would have good friends. Also, if you see someone bullying a kid don't watch, and stand up for them, don't be afraid to stand up for someone because you're doing the right thing.

Some may disagree with me and say that it's not that big of a deal, and it doesn't feel like a big accomplishment. But with all do respect, I agree that it's a big accomplishment because nowadays it's really hard to become yourself.

In conclusion, It's hard to become yourself in this world, because others are holding that opportunity back from you and you're afraid to fight it back. That's why I agree that to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,5.0
00ED2563D0B1,"Philosopher, physician, and humanitarian Albert Schweitzer once said "" Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing"". I strongly agree, imagine you being the reason why a person decided to make a remarkable change in there life just by following your footsteps, imagine how that would make you feel. Setting a good example everyday is one of the most important things you can do in life; you dont know who is watching you, and you dont know who is getting an impact from your good ways. People watch others every move and learn new and better things as time goes so they can also turn out to influence others. Consider yourself as a leader being able to influence people is a leadership movement, everyone needs someone to help them and guide them through things they may not tell you, but they'll watch your examples and learn.

Many may think that there are better ways unlike setting an example by your behavior is the best way to influence others; but little do they know that setting an example by your behavior is the best way to influence others. Setting good examples is helpful in so many ways however; there are other ways to influence others. People get influenced on anything these days, just sitting around and watching TV can influence you to do something. But think about it would you rather have someone set examples for you, and have someone you can watch to motivate you and guide you; or would you rather sit around and procrastinate on time?. As the influencer having people look up to you and following the way you move is a big deal. For example when surgical interns first go to a hospital to work they look up to their head surgeons. The head surgeons set examples for the interns because they want them to be successful, the intern watching the head surgeon during operations and check ups influences and motivates them to do better and be better. Even for school students thats how they all learn from examples the teachers show them, it influences the students to try so they can also be good at what their teaching is teaching them.

Some people may prefer to get influenced in another way because they may not want someone by them step by step they may be more independent and like to be on there own. Having good behavior benefits you in a lot of ways, you will get a lot of opportunities, help and inspire a lot of people and gain a lot. For example parents have a good influence on there kids. They are the reason why there kids wake up and try every day, seeing your parents have a good and positive behavior will motivate and influence you to do better. As you go on with good behavior people will see you and begin to know that there is something your doing to be happy. You will have people come around you because of your vibe and good energy. Once they start talking to you you automatically begin to influence them to be a better person. Knowing that you are a motivator and an influence onto others is a good feeling. You will know that your good work and good behavior has a good effect strong enough to influence others in the best way possible.

Overall setting a good example by your behavior is the best way to influence others, they learn better, feel comfortable and get to experience a lot. Having someone look up to you as a good influence will help you both because it will make you both feel great and you both will benefit from it in the long run. We have people around us for a reason, if you have someone that is willing to help you and influence you to be better in life take the chance because it will be a great experience and you will change as a person once you get influenced in the right way by the right people in life.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0
01501F95B8B2,"10pm curfews is a bad idea, why? Because teens lives would be affected in many different ways, including the fact that in can get them in much more trouble. Teens would have to adjust to this rule and some might not even know about the rule when it comes out. I think that teens should not get an early curfew but instead change it to a later time, so teens dont have to go through having to deal with changing there hole life around. having a law like this can get teens in more trouble because now they have an extra law that can be broken easily with out even knowing. teens enjoy being out late and doing things, it can make them feel older and more grown up like.

Teens are stuck in school seven hours a day and it can take a good bit of there day away so having that option to stay out later and being able to do things is a great option for them. Lots of teens want to go shopping and hang out with friends at a mall, but school and homework can take a while so they cant do it during the day always. for example, a friend and me wanted to go to the movies after school but we got assigned lots of home work and we new we would be busy the next days, so in order to be able to watch the movie, we would have to go at night time. curfews can inter fear with couples who want to do something later in the night, and it would be unfair to the teens to have to go back home just because they can't stay out late. Having said all this, teens are old enough that they can make there own decisions.

Lots of tees have after school jobs taking them late into the night, and a lot of them need to be able to walk home. Teens would have to start having to start to work around the new law and make changes to there work hours. Also kids would start getting less work hours resulting in the not getting enough money, some house hold have teens helping pay bills. Curfews laws are and will be the most common law being broken resulting in an increase of crime. teens do not like it when they get told how long they get to stay out, which will result in them just braking the law.

I would be surprised if teens would start getting in less trouble, because teens will still do what they want even if you set a curfew. A curfew only tells a teen that your not suppose to be outside, but that still does not mean that they will do it. Teens are going to do what they want at the end of the day and not what the law tells them to. The best way to make sure teens can stay on track but the still to be a curfew is that the curfew should be moved up to 12pm. Also teens enjoy going to gas station at night to get stuff and lots of the enjoy the walk as well.

In conclusion I think that if we just move the curfew up to 12pm it would allow teens to have a good night out with out having to worry about being out to late. Also showing that kids can get in more trouble by having an early curfew just means that its a bad idea and should not be implemented. If adults could just put more trust in teens i think it would improve kids behavior and also have kids get to prove them self to show how responsible they can be. teens are more responsible than everyone might think, I think they just need a chance to prove it to everyone. I think earlier curfews are a bad idea and that it should just be moved up a little for that will help teens out in the long shot.",3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0
01A65BA4080E,"Most schools let students use their cell phones during class for educational purposes, however, other schools don't think that allowing students to use their cell phones would be better than using computers in the library or computer labs, by allowing students to use their phones there will be a higher chance for them to get distracted doing what they are not supposed to intead of doing their assignments. Students should not be aloud to use their phones during class because students would pay more attention to their phones than their teachers.

Some teachers would rather take their students to the library or to a computer lab to use the computers to do assignments, instead of letting them use their phones because students would not get their work done. For example in my school we used to have the school WIFI on our phones but that only made us get distracted so my school decided to take down the WIFI from our phones, this year we were given chromebooks so we can do our class works in class without having to go to the library or a computer lab. We can take our chromebooks in any class to do our assignments and it's made a huge impact on every student because now no one is ever on their phones, and we pay more attention to our teachers.

By letting students use their cell phones during class will increase the chances for them to get distracted, for example one day my english teacher gave us a reaserch paper and told us that we could use our cell phones to search up important documents, while we were doing our work one of my classmates' phone went off because she got a snapchat notification and everyone got distracted, the next day everyone was using their phones in class and no one was doing the work that we were assigned to do. Students should not be aloud to use their phones during class because it will not benefit them, this would be a distraction to not only students but teachers as well.

If schools let students use their phones there also will be a higher chance that students' grades will drop, and a lot of parents would not be pleased. My parents would get extremely mad if my school let us use our cell phones during class because they know I would easily get distracted, if we were aloud to use our phones the whole school would be a disaster. Teachers would not be happy with the idea of letting students use their phones, because every teacher wants the whole class' attention on them not their cellular devices. Some students and schools might think that letting students use their phones would be a great idea because it could probably benefit those students who might not have a computer at home, and maybe letting them use their cell phones during class to do their assigments would help them, but that doesn't mean that every student has to use their phones too.

Schools should not let students use their phones for educational purposes because it would be a big distraction for students and teachers. By allowing us students to use our cell phones it's only increasing our chances to get distracted and it would make our grades drop. If we were aloud to use our cell phones during school we would not pay attention to our teachers and we would never get our work done. Us students should not be aloud to use our cell phones during school because it will not benefit us, it will only make us distracted. Teachers and parents would not be pleased if schools let students use their cell phones during class, we're teenagers and we get distracted very easily.       ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5
027CB6393714,"Hello, my name is Generic_Name and I am a student at Generic_School. Students at Generic_School are required to take classes in arts. In my opinion student's should not be required to take arts classes because they might need other class. First some students might want to boost there GPA so they have a better chance of getting into the college they want to go too. Also students might need to get the extra support they need to pass in their classes. The class work might be a little difficult for the student who might not understand what is going on in the class room, so they might need more support in class insted of taking arts classes. students need to improve on there grads or get extra help and should not take arts classes. Secondly Students have outside responsibility out of school like a job and sometimes when you have a job your boss might call you and say can you cover someones shift and your boss tells you to come in and you have to be there on time and the student has to leave early or not come to school at all, or a student has to pick there little borther or sister from school or daycare. Thirdly Some students are artistic and they want to be in arts classes like dram, art, music and enjoy doing art classes but all students are not artistic some students are shy or could get panic attacks they prefer to in a extra class or in study hall. In conclusion I think that arts classes should not be a requirement for graduation because students want to get there work done, get extra help to understand their class work or they may have a job they need to get go for and need to leave early and students are not artistic.",3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,4.0,3.0
032EA4B76BF5,"Some people may think that positive attitude is not the key to success in life, but I disagree with them because I feel like now days are not the same like it used to be, and I think its a big issue that we have today in our world.

People just wanna finish their jobs very fast, and they wanna get where their going really fast,

and that leads to not have a good attitude with others, one of the first reasons is you can get to your dream job, for example if your positive with others they can like you or offer you a deal that's going to change your life for ever, and they may say that your a great person, and they might offer you to come and work in their company or work in a really great passion.

Another reason is you can make someones day or make them happy, for example their having a really bad day and you come and talk to them with a positive attitude, and maybe your going to make them really happy and also that can effect on others if you make them happy they can make others people happy also.

One last reason is Communication, for example by having a positive attitude you can communicate with others, and you can have a good relationship with them and maybe be really good friends.

In conclusion for all theses reasons i think positive attitude is the key to your success.              ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0

03CC97D3747E,"Many schools have partner ships with companies that can allow students to explore certain occupations through internships and shadowing opportunities to discover whether they are interested in pursuing that type of employment. In my opinion its a good idea to allow students to explore certain occupations through internships and to discover whether they are interested or not. By allowing them to visit and explore, they are most likely to know what they want in life and in their upcoming future, and they can get a good job that pays money in the future.

The first reason as to why it is a good idea to explore certain occupations through internships is because, students will most likely know what they really want to do in life and it will help them start a good future. I have a cousin named Generic_Name, he has three kids named Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and Generic_Name. Believe it or not Generic_Name was chosen to go to Liberty University a few years ago. He went to the College to see if anything they taught was interesting. A few months later, Generic_Name started going to Liberty for a few years and finished off with straight A's. Today he owns his own business, and he is happy as ever.

The second reason why it is good to explore certain occupations through internships is because, you are willing to get a good job that pays very well. I have another cousin named Generic_Name, He is the strongest and most bravest person I have ever met. Generic_Name is the AirForce, he joined the air force a few years ago. He loved it there although he said it was somewhat rough. He went to the AirForce because his parents didnt have enough money for him to go to college. After leaving the AirForce he chose to go to Liberty University as well, He absolutely loved it there. He graduated in 2015. He is now working for the FBI and I could not be any prouder of him then I am right now. A few weeks ago I went over to his house and he said ""Generic_Name when i was in the AirForce it was rough for me, I felt like it was useless. Now i know that god put me in that position, because he wanted something big for me. I feel like i'm on top of the world I have never felt any better then I do today. I also have so much money too, thanks to the job i have they pay really well. One of these days I want to buy a mansion."" I saw tears coming out of his eyes ,and I felt so proud, I said to myself, ""I want to feel like i'm on top of the world, I want something big for me.""

Many students may say that they don't care about college which is somewhat understandable. I was with a friend one day and I was telling her about how I want to go to college so bad, but she didnt seem to care. She looked me in the eyes and said, ""What's the point of college anyways, its just like going back to hell. My parents never went and there fine."" They also say that going to college is the worst thing ever. My friend once said, ""Why do schools even give the opportunity to students to figure out where they want to go, we don't need college and we dont need a future either. I Actually like working at Wendy's."" After my friends said those nasty things about college it just made me want to work harder in life and get better grades in school.

In conclusion, exploring certain occupations through internships is not that bad of an idea, its a brilliant idea. As i once said, I'm most likely to know what i want in the future, and I will get a good job that pays well. My cousins really have inspired me, because of them and their story, I want to be better and I want to work harder. Maybe later in life I will be working for the government and I will make my future kids happy.",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0
04FA62C5F269,"The positive attitude is the key to success in life?. Experiments support the idea that a positive attitude help in life, because the people thing positive. Most part of the poblation is happy because they success in life and catch up all the goals. A high percentage of poblation get stuck in their preoccupations and they can't see the light of the sun; they think that life hate them. The poblation should take a positive attitude because is the key to success in life, and the people feel free of stress and preoccupation.

The scientist studies show us that a positive attitude help in life. A bunch part universities pass a lot of time doing research for understand the human mind and their attitudes. If you watch the news, news paper or internet they share with you all the discovery, of course that the information is shared with the authorization of the universities. The people think when universities discover something huge or important of the human body is a big step for a man, because a human body in a secret box.

The poblation is happy because they success in life. The major part of poblation think that when you have a positive mind the stress is lower and the output is higher. The brain probably is not a huge muscle but, if you use to a positive form all your body respond because all your body is connected with your brain. For this reason people give you this tip for a good style of live and a good success to.

On other hand a high percent get stuck in life. These part of poblation is the minimum part that say that life is hard and not every thing is easy because you need put afford. Even if you have a positive attitude they say that life sucks and is hard get the thing that you need or dream. But for this people is; more hard you tried to get a positive attitude it's impossible, sometimes you fall through in life and then you give up and dont tries more.

Here is a example of positive attitude: When you have a test and you are so nervous, but you think on you mind that you can do it because you're totally sure that you remember the classes and the topics that you teacher teach in class. With a positive attitude you can do a lot of thing for most difficult that it's look. For this reason the human brain is totally amazing bacause you discover a lot of capacity for doing things that you think that you can't do it.

In short, if you want success in life think positive for most difficult that show up you can do it. The human body have a big capacity for doing change to their self, and if you thing negative is time that you change your mind and start thinking positive. Also if you think more positive than negative you health get better you must have a healthy mind and body, also when you talk with other person you can transmit your positive environment or they can feeling easily, so be positive.

Cell phone is a very popular device now a days and almost everyone use it to communicate with others. I have a cell phone my self too. I think cell phone is appropriate for student to use during lunch periods and other free times as long as they turn off their cell phone during class and use it for appropriate matters. Cell phone can help people solving matters by talking on the phone and contact when some emergency happened.

Cell phone can help people in many ways, as long as we have a limit on it.

Cell phone is a device that has many functions. It can help people in many ways. When there is an emergency at school, the best device to use to communicate with your parent to tell them you are safe, or polices to report the incident is cell phone. Cell phone is not a direct contact, but it gives the least secure to a matter such as you are safe, some specific thing happening in school, and some decision that can be solve using cell phone instead of meeting face to face. Cell phone will be fine to use at school as long as students are using it for the correct matter and does not let the cell phone disrupt them during class.

As time went by, more and more function appear on the cell phone can make our student and adult's life easier. Some cell phone can even go to the internet! Some people can use cell phone as a material to find resource, study online, and read books online instead of carry those heavy books home. Cell phone is simplification for many thing you do, it can not absolutely replace books, but it makes easier for people to read and study. If we can let the student to bring the cell phone to school and only let them use it during free periods or lunch time. I'm sure that it would benefit both our student and you.

I agree with Michelangelo that you dont need to be the best as long as you put effort in to it you can do anything but at the same time i disagree with this quotes because you dont need your setting to be low it can be high at the same time it really doesnt matter how you can achieve your mark no matter what way or path you decide to take life take to different place makes you do different decides.

Today people can do a lot of things using technology, but there are some good and bad effects that technology cause on people's lives. Technology can cause bad effects and there are some people that they can see what is technology causing and they just prefer to continue using technology. Technology need limitation for humans.

Although some people says that technology had positive effects on people's lives, actually technology can have negative effects on people's lives because technology cause addiction to peoples. Addiction to technology is a big problem in the world. Some people believe that technology doesn't cause negative effects on people's lives, but this is not true because technology can cause problems on people's lives.

First reason, why does technology had negative effects on people's lives is because technology cause a lot of problem on peoples. One of the problem is that today technology had a big impact on people specially in adults, kids, and adolescents. The majority of people are using technology some of them knows what it can cause if they are using this all the time. For example, some kids start using technology when they just have 4 or 5 years old, and it can cause positive effects and also can cause negative effects because they start learning, but at the same time they are creating a big addiction to cell phones. The parents have to control this and dont give to their kids cell phones because they just are kids and dont need to use technology too much. Kids can use technology to study or have fun, but they need limitation of technology .

Second reason, why does technology cause negative effects on peoples lives is because adolescents are using technology to play online. This is causing a big problem to them because they are getting addiction to this. Some adolescents just prefer to stay at home playing and they dont want to go out with their parents.

The Washington post had a article about the addiction that technology is causing on people's lives. This article says that people who are playing online are having problems with banks. For example, Some of them have to pay to play online. They can't stop playing because they have a addiction. They start using credits card of their parents and they create debt with banks.

In conclusion technology had negative impact on people's lives. Technology have to have supervision because it is causing a big impact in the world. The are some positive effects that technology cause, but the majority are negative effects. Some people want to stop technology and there are some that they just want a better world without problems and addictions to technology. ",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5

I have to start from zero like meeting new teachers and new people and knowing the school. After a week the teacher and people i met were nice and good people. I didn't like idea of transfering of schools and leaving the people i know from Generic_School.

For some other people the first impression is impossible to change. Like when companies are looking for people to hire but they want people that are self condifent,hard working,resposible. If a person don't show any good impression in their interview most likely is not going to get hired.

However, people can change impressions over time. Like in the If a person didn't show a great impression in the job interview giving them a change it might change their first impression. I think it is possible to change first impression. ",3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0
079FDB42E429,"Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by a way of online or video conferencing. Schools offer this so that students who are troubled or don't like coming to school can still have a right to to learn and it also helps students who are very sickly to have access to all their classes and homework that they missed when their not at school.

Some students can not focus in class because they are easily distracted by other students and by these distractions they end up getting bad grades and it causes them to lose hope in school and even what they want to become in life. they could also have something happening outside of school that could affect them to not want to be in school anymore and they can also get bullied by other students which would make them stop coming to school and some kids are just better off staying a home and doing classes at home.

These online and distance learning classes can help students get back on track with school and catch up with their work that they missed. The students who want to be home schooled can wake up at anytime that they choose and do the work that is planned for them and the ones that don't like coming to school or the ones that get bullied can stay at home and get their work done without missing class and getting bad grades because of them not being their to do classwork or take test and quizzes. The students who are taking these classes can benefit from these a lot.

These programs can help students be able to their work on their own time and a have teacher who can teach them but online like at school and this can help students become independent in being able to do their work and help them stay away from trouble that they could be having at school and give them confidence to be able to do their work. I think this can benefit students because they are in the comfort of their homes and its like a regular class but it just online and you could get all your work done and by that you earn good grades.

If students who don't like coming to school,sickly and get bullied,always miss class and get bad grades because their are not their to take tests or quizzes then these online and distance class can benefit them to do work at the comfort of their home. It will also persuade them to not give up on school and give them a right to get their education before they throw it away. These online classes and distance classes can help teach these students as if they were in school and if they work hard enough they can get good grades. These are all reasons why these programs can benefit student.",2.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5
07C6BB6ADA38,"One topic that is frequently debated today is schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing would be benefit to student or not. Some people believe school should offer this program for students that need time for their morning routine. They feel that it would help students for do not need to have to wake up early and go to school. I believe distance learning program that school offer for students would not be benefit to students because students will not have a skill to communicate with other people, it will make students have less enthusiasm, and some students family did not have no internet or device to watch the video online teaching.

One reason why schools should not offer the distance learning program because it would make student get less skill from communicate with other people. When students go to school they will meet friends have a communication with each other or talk to their teacher. Communication is an important for every type of jobs. Communication is one of the most important thing that should have inside the lesson because every job or every company will hiring people that have good skill to communication with other people. Communication is almost every where inside the school but if school have to consent to have the distance learning program, it will affect to student to get a job by taking students away from their communication with other people.

Another reason why schools should not offer the distance learning program because it will make students have less enthusiasm to learn. Every morning students have to wake up early and get ready for school is one of the practice thing that will let student get ready for outside the world. Enthusiasm is one of the most thing that will help students to have more responsibility to their job or their self. Lack of the enthusiasm will make students have a lack of responsibility to their job or their self. However, if school consent the distance program it will make student get a lack of the enthusiasm and it will make students get lack of the responsibly to take care even them self.

Final reason why schools should not offer the distance learning program because some students did not have device or Internet at home to watch the online or video conferencing. There are many family that did not have the Internet at home and they will not be able to attend the classes at home and will not be able to watch the online or video conferencing. It will not be fair to the outer family that do not have a internet or device to get into the online or video conference to the family that have the internet or device to use. Therefore, school should not consent the distance learning program to make all the students equally.

As you have read, I believe distance learning program that school offer to students would not be benefit to students and affect to students by take students to the bad position. School is the learning place for students to get a knowledge. If we are going to have only the online teaching, school will not exist. Only when we value the learning in class, communicating with friends, and being equal with other we will feel that school is a good place for studying and getting the knowledge. On that day the world will better to have school full with students that have a good knowledge and ready for out world.",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.5
085C8B43ADD6,"Some students would be more excited about having a longer summer vacation, it can give the students a longer time to spend with their families and friends, but if we think in a positive side it also means that having a longer break i could be most likely be a reward for those who has been studying hard throughout the whole entire year that deserves to get a vacation or a break of getting away from everything that has them stressing out over paper or either having to worry about their grades, which is good for students to knows how serious and important their education is so, they can success in the future all full of opportunities knowing what do to when it comes to face their problems alone base on what they have learn.

For example in this Prompt educators thinks that students do not seem to retain what they have learn during the year when they are coming back to school after their break, they seem not know about anything or forget about stuff, which is true people to not appear to be thinking about things that might stress them out, instead they try to have fun with their love ones, and of course try to read some books every other day or read the news papers so you wont be left behind on what is actually going on in the world, perhaps we might forgot about stuff younger people are faster learners and thinkers, can not be able to forget about important information that easy.

Most of the students usually travels a lot during summer vacation out of the state or they like to visit different countries, so yes basically what i'm trying to say is that a longer break or summer vacation is a good idea for those in specific who travels far away so it can give them enough time to explore wherever they going to be staying, and this can even be helpful for students to learn about different history, experiences, explore and this are some stuff that they can even share with their friends in school or with their teachers, that it can improve more their knowledge. Being away from school just for at least one month it can really effect anyone, I think that this could be effecting on just depending on how distracted you will be during the break, some students can't even call it a ""break"" or ""vacation"" because some of them would rather to take this time to earn a little bit of money to be able to effort for their needs and expenses,

or they might have responsibilities to take care of,Others likes to volunteer in community services or try to be involve in different activities that will keep you busy.

In respond to everything i do think that having a longer summer vacation would be good enough to catch up as much as we can with our old friends and families maybe when we were in school we was't able to see them enough because some of our love ones live far away from us so we take our time to spend every little moment we have lost while we were way and it benefits everyone in general, not just for students.

Generic_Name had no way to communicate with the employer; However, when Generic_Name got to the place where she was going to be interviewed,she explained what happened and it was the reason why she was late to her job interview and she was sorry for it,because her phone was really expensive Generic_Name had a bad attitude with the employer even though it was not the fault of the employer. Because of the bad attitude of Generic_Name,she had the result of not obtaining the job Generic_Name always dreamed of. Since that day Generic_Name controls her attitude and learned that a positive attitude is the key to success in life even if we are having hard times. If an individual thinks that a positive attitude is not the way to be successful relax because there are a lot of ways to show him or her that a positive attitude is the success in life. A positive attitude is the key to success in life because of better opportunities and a non-stressed life.

To begin with, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because of better opportunities. Society might have no problems at school or at any place they go if they have a good attitude and know how to control themselves. For example, my cousin Generic_Name since she was little was a really good student, and always had great comments from her teachers because of her attitude and effort at school. Last year when Generic_Name graduated from Generic_School, a lot of important people offered her to work with them because they have seen the way Generic_Name was a great students, even though when she was on her bad days she always had a good attitude. Some people might say that a positive attitude is not the key to success in life because it can lead people to have some opportunities of good works and also to have friends, but they are wrong because having a good attitude all the time will help people to have greater opportunities at work as well at school. Also that people could never have any complain for having a bad attitude because they know how to control themselves.

To continue,a positive attitude is the key to success in life because of a non-stressed life. Having a positive attitude can lead people to have a better future in their lives. Also, my neighbour Generic_Name used to live in California where he had no friends because Generic_Name was really shy. Since Generic_Name moved to Virginia with his Mom Generic_Name and his brother Generic_Name,he have met a lot of people at school and also in his neighborhood, which now they are friends. Generic_Name used to be really quiet because he was scared of what people might think about him, but lately he have made a bunch of new friends and have a happy and non-stressed life he no longer thinks about what people is going to judge him;Nevertheless, Generic_Name have learned that a good attitude of the key to success in life. Generic_Name is happy because his son has a great attitude and he is doing better at school now.

To conclude, because of better opportunities and a non-stressed life, a positive attitude is the key to success in life. A positive attitude help teachers,students,employers,employees as many others. A good attitude is the result of a great education and by that attitude you can reach good thing in life, some things you never thought you could have.

0943E322C195,"To me its more beneficial working as a group. I have a few reasons why its better working with a group rather then working alone you can learn from one another also be motivated to learn as a group. Making new friends can be tough but when you are but in a group you can make friends with each other. One thing in a group that can be good and bad is having disscustions with the group. There are many reasons why i prefer working with a group and im hear to share with you.

Working with a group is all about sharing new ideas and discovery with your group that some people didn't know about. With a group everyone would get good grades and ace their exams. Some people in your group may have the same intrest as you and would like to study that objective more and being motivated by one another.

In my opinion working with a group is more simpler and fun at the same time and kids will enojy learning that way.

One small little problem about working with a group is having disscustions about the subject that the group is talking about. They with all disagreements but also argree with each other . The group tends to get mad maybe because someone in the group said something the other didn't like and would have a argument. There are more pros then cons in working with a group for sure .

Everyone has a different saying if its beneficial to either work with a group or work alone .

I'm not at all saying working alone is a bad thing on the contrarie its also good because sometimes you might not get along with the group you got asand with and you just wanna do your work alone. Working in a group though brings you toghter as a school and theres nothing better then working in a team.",3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

0AD69388300B,"One topic that is frequently debated today is whether students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Some people taking classes from home is more helpful. They feel like they have more time to do extra activities throughout the day. I believe that going to school is better because you get to experience real world, you get make friends, and you get to enjoy all the school activities.

First reason, why I think going to school is better than taking classes at home is that you get to experience the real world. When you go to school you have to wake up early to get ready and make it on time to school, in the other hand when you are home schooled you get to wake up at whatever time and still do your work, that is not experiencing the real world because life it is not always going to be like that. School makes you experience the real world by so many ways. When you are at school you work in groups with other people and that is getting you ready for when you grow up and have to work with other people at your job.

Second reason, why I think going to school is better than taking classes at home is that you get to make friends. When going to school you get to interact with people and make new friends, in the other hand when you are at home you do not interact with anyone it is only you by yourself. Having friends is really good, they can help with what they can. At school you can ask your friends for help in a subject when you do not understand something.

Third reason, why I think going to school is better than taking classes at home is that you get to enjoy all the school activities. School activities are one of the favorite things about school that students like. If you are home schooled you do not get to enjoy them and have fun with your friends. When going to school you get to enjoy senior night, school dances, and extra curricular activies, which are super fun.

As you have read, I believe that going to school is better than taking your classes from home because you get to experience real world, you get make friends, and you get to enjoy all the school activities. School teaches you most of the things that you know and need in life at the end of the day. On that day we are going to realize on why we need school so much.

People always need somebody to be by their side, it's not good to stay isolated it could make you go crazy. Fifty percent of all people go through depression, anxiety attacks and mental breakdowns because there's nobody there to help them, sometimes when you try to help they just either ignore you or they just don't want to be spoken too that means they haven't been seeking help. A person who has a companion can be going through things too you know, but they express themselves to their best friend but for more help you can talk to your specialist doctor. Doctors and authorities are really a good help, they hear you out and always agree with you. Experts should be people who are very close to you it could be a neighbor, family relative, family members, your boss, coworkers and even your friends.

Authorities sometimes don't really help you when your having mental breakdowns because sometimes they don't care or it's not their business.

Sometimes at work it's hard for you to share what you are thinking even at school, a lot of people have to over think their ideas because they think it's not good enough, that makes them lose precious time because time is usually short and you need all the time you can get, it's better to go seek help because your struggling to think of a good idea.

Most of the people in this world are really good at making their own decisions because they have nothing really to worry about, they like to be independent and always get things done quicker that way. For some people it's really not that easy for them to get their work done because they have a huge struggle in their life, they need the help, but sometimes they don't ask because they don't want embarrass themselves in front of others that work independently. Everyone deserves to be treated fairly and equal, the world needs to open their eyes sometimes because a lot of people are taking their life because they don't receive they need, day and night, sixty percent of people in this world work hard to live, they work hard to cover your monthly bills, groceries, clothes and gas if they have a car. People who make low income deserve a big chance so they can maintain themselves, when you in situation like that look for people you know and ask what they work for, it might match what like to do. People who are struggling to maintain rent and other important things they can always seek for government assistance.

People are living in this world for a reason, they need to survive and live their life. Everybody got to do what they got to do sometimes when it comes to surviving, there is a lot of single family dad's and mom's in this world, most of the time they can't even maintain their kids and home. It's a good idea to always have someone in your life they motivate you and care for you, they do much more because their here for you no matter the situation, Always have help beside you, you will need it. A lot of people who are alone and make their own decisions, don't have families and friends, they just rather do their way because they know what they are doing. Not everyone is the same, everyone has different problems and they usually go through them alone, sometimes they don't know how to think and how to live. At the end of the day there has to be someone out there that can help you with your life, your never alone always remember that.

You are able to work on your own pace,you are also able to balance school,work and spending time with friends and families,and your able to take video conferencing at home.

There are many different schools that can let you take online classes. There students going through family issues at home that they aren't able to attend school regularly. It can help them to learn in class so they don't fall behind or fail the grade. They just want to learn like us and have a great future.

When having the benefit to take online class at home is working at your own pace. You are working at your own pace to get in done fast or you just like to take your time.

It can also help them be more then the other colleagues at school. When having this opportunity your able to get work done without any distractions.

He want to see if we are responsible with our own work and left to lose the time just little things, he just want that his people can make their dreams. When he wrote this people was scare because their people was slave before

Abraham Lincol become president of the United State. This show three reason why he wrote this.

First, Thomas Jefferson spend his time with us because he want to see how his people really following his wrote. Many people don't think about what they can do in their life, if we still spend time with other people we don't accomplish our own dreams, sometimes people are shy,and scare with their dreams because other people can bother them because they can accomplish their dreams or may be they don't believe in them. Some people can't acommplish their dreams because they think that is lot stuff but the reason is that they never try, if they can accommplish their dreams.

Second, if we look and read carefully we can find more about this wrote. We really can't thinking about because we don't have commitment to make our own dreams better. Some people are in school but they don't see the opportunity that we have for make a lot stuff in the future. We just go at school because our mothers dispatch us at the school. If we used about Thomas Jefferson wrote we can learn how we have work hard for make our life much better. We just have to think just in the our future and study more for have a good grade and accomplish the dreams we wish.

Third, in this time we have much time in our own life for do a lot stuff because we are freedom. But we just think to go out with friend and have fun, nobody care their dreams in this time. They spends their time in party and doing lots stuff with our friends. If we still doing the same things with our friends we never get something better in our own life. We need to have more commitment about what we really want in our future.

In conclusion, we can be better than other people because we are young and we can do more stuff. We can teach them thst we can do all this stuff, if we can think better. We have a good concentration in all what we do. Don't matter what we can accomplish our own dreams because we are not alone we have our familes for support us with really we want to do in the future.

Students will not be benefited if they attend classes from home by online or video conferencing because then they will not concentrate much on studies and which will lead to bad grades. They will not be having test and quizzes often. They might become lazy and start copying each other work. If they do not attend school, then there will be less chances of students doing work sincerely at home. They will not be able to get proper education at home and there will be less communication with students and teachers. If there will be less communication then they will not be able to get more open with others. There will be no group work so that students can share their ideas regarding studies. They might start taking breaks often. There will be no routine for students for studying at home. They will not be able to concentrate much working at home due to lot of distractions like T.V, movies, videos games, text ting etc. If you will not get a better education you might not be able to sussed in life.

How much you learn and read more the better because learning and reading takes you around the world.

The first thing i'll be talking about my skills. One of my skill it cooking; I love cooking and it's one of my favorite thing to do at home when I have nothing else to do, and I'm pretty decent at it. I can only cook one thing for now, the only thing I can cook right now are eggs such as sunny side ups, scrambled, and an omelet. My dad is the one who got me into cooking, and I wanted to be a good cook like him. Another skill of mine is that I can run kind of fast I don't like running that much but I still run. I can also run far with one breath, and I don't have a lot of stamina. I can also bake. It's rare for me to bake because I usually don't do it a lot, but it fun to do if you're bored and you want to make something. The only two things that I made was cupcakes, and chocolate cake. My dad's girlfriend is the one who made kind of like baking because it fun to do.

Now i'll be talking about my talents. A talent I have is drawing; Drawing is one of my top five favorite things to do when i'm not doing anything or when i'm bored. I'm decent at drawing but not really good yet I practice on trying to get better at it, and the things I draw are random because when I draw something random I usually draw it when i'm bored. The person who got me into drawing was my sister, when I saw her drawings I was amazed cause she was a good drawer, and I wanted to draw like her one day. Math is also one of my talents: math is my number one subject because i like it, and my friends say i'm good at it. When I we have a hard problem I sometimes don't use my calculator because I always forget I have one.

I also like build most of the time because I get to go outside and find stuff I can play with, I usually find big sticks and carve them after I finish carving them I start sanding it so it wouldn't so rough when I finish I paint them to make it look cool, but now I bare;y do it because I have a lot of stuff to do.

But, also last year I did art and took all art clubs ,and classes ,and usually I like to be a real cartoonist so this year I want to be a writer. And I want to do that for this year. But I am still good at it. So next year in ninth grade I am doing art again next year. And I use whenever I'm bored and there nothing I can do at home of at school.

So for writing I want to write novels and books for everybody. And lately I have been taking writing classes during the summer. But last year I started being a cartoonist and start writing newspapers and drawing cartoons for the newspapers. At School I join the animate club and then I started drawing pictures for the scenes of the cartoon. And I like it. So I join the yearbook club and I started writing the captions under the photos. To tell and say what it actually means. So last year for third block I had facs ,and I use art for the cakes and cupcakes and also ice cream. And then I think that art is good for me.

So let me tell about my favorite skill writing. The main I like writing is I like to write novels and books. But my favorite book I like to write is about Transformers Dark of the moon. My favorite graphic novel of all times and it is the number one movie to be produce of all times and in the beginning of the novel is the war of cybertron and the rest of the movie is all about everything about the space race.

Writing can also contain facts and opinions detail#3:

Art is everything

It can be all around us

And ,but also writing can have vocabulary and it is for spelling. But you must check your spelling whenever you are done with an article or an essay. And it also contains art. But also for art it shows like it graphic novels authors must make bubble speeches for the people it the book to say. Whenever they are happy, sad, or other kinds of feelings. But it contains all kinds of words and languages for people to say ,and the bold means what is important and what it really means. But it means whenever a person reads a book. And what it have to say what it self.

My conclusion is that in the future I continue to think about my talents and skills and what they really means to me. But still I think I still care about it. And that is for everyone else's.

0E03218FDD2F,"Educators say that students should have shorter breaks because, students don't retain information as easily when they return, its better if students spend more time in school rather than taking long breaks, summer breaks are better when they are shorter. Some students say having long breaks gives them time to relax and not having to worry about school for a couple of weeks is a good thing. One day on my summer break me and my friends were discussing on how much we love our long summer breaks. We also realized that having a long summer break is only fair because we spend so many hours in school everyday.

Summer breaks are better when they are shorter because, students dont forget as much information that they learned during school. Its better to come back and still remember the stuff you learned. Just imagine coming back after a 5 week break, I doubt students would be able to take a test right away. We need shorter breaks because if students spend to much time away from school they'll forget the important things they've learned. Students should consider spending more time in school rather than spending all there time on their breaks.

Spending more time in school is more important than spending longer weeks out of school not learning anything. Students must realize that their education is more important than spending time off of school. School teaches us what we need to know for the future, it prepares us for the next stage of life. They need to realize that they need to learn us much as they can, the more effort put into school work and learning the better the outcome. Life shows us that you can't just get a job without knowing anything, you can't sign up if you don't know your basic math or basic reading. Some students think school is a waste of time but honestly it's preparing us for the stuff we need to know.

Students do not retain information as easily when they return. Those long breaks really take a toll on the students, they return to school and don't have a clue on how to solve a basic problem. The more time students have out of school the more it drains their memory on what they've learned. Coming back on an empty brain not knowing anything isn't good at all because what if a student had an exam on the day he or she returned, do you think they'd pass? Having a shorter break would improve a lot of things.

In conclusion, it'd be so much better if breaks were shorter than they usually are. Students would be able to come back and easily answer a question and get it right. The less time on break the better, school should be the main priority for students. Im sure that some of the students would love to pass their classes. Overall we know that having a shorter break would improve the learning skill for all students. I agree that our breaks should be shorter so we could stay on track and keep p our good work.

First, students shouldn't use cell phone in classroom because, they are trouble in the class room. That mean when the teacher is teaching the students may be listing music so that makes trouble the other students, They didn't do any thing for classwork. They only doing listing music and watch a movie so on that happen it's very disturb. Also, If the student want listen music and teacher never want to listen music so that make fight with teacher. In the class room students usually don't use cell phone so one students use every time cellphone in class he/she always trouble in class maybe that happen again and again in class the school decide and rejected him/her for didn't come to school.

Socond, students shouldn't have a cellphone in classroom because, they are doing chat when the teacher is teaching For example, When the teacher is teach on the classroom and students doing on the chat there is no attention what the teacher says. Their is no attenition to learn. Their is only play with their friends in the class .Their is show a bad image with their friends. It mean one student want to joke for other student girls or boys so he gonna show for that person bad and rude picture then student lough in bad situation. Also, the one students lough for him picture his/her moral is not good so they don't want to come again school by confidently. He/ She is scared and afraid.

Third, students shouldn't have a cellphone in classroom because, they are cheating on the test. For example, If the teacher gave for students a test and he sat down in the chair then one students have a cellphone he/she can cheat on their phone so they got a good grade for that test that makes bad for the other students score. It means students they dont have confidence do their own test. Every time they don't want to study for test and they always think doing cheat on the test but that is bad for his/her kownleage.

Fourth, students shouldn't have a cellphone in classroom because, there is no any particpate and activites when the teacher ask question for students. Their is more time waste and spend their time with their cell phone all the days. There is bad for health because when every time watch movie and listen music that is no good for brain and eyes. It means every time stay with their phone and the brain control one thing just the movie or the music so we can't handle or participate other thing even didnt look the people what their saying.

For example, the prompt says It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. Therefor, being a positive person would bring better life choices in the future.

Agreeing with this statement would represent you as a positive person. Some examples would be, being positive would bring better benefits. This stands for being a nice and positive person would bring new and better things in life.

i will like to star in saying that i think it would be good for us student to help the environment because that way there is not to much contamination on the community and it would be healthy and safe to the people that lives in the community. Us student can also do good thinks when we are doing the community service because that way un winter we can go and shovel some snow and on summer we could do other things. and doing community service its not only going outside or doing hard work you can also help some church , hospitals ,in a store and also in helping teachers and other things like babysitting. Doing community service it could also be fun it doesn't have to always be boring it could be fun because if they send you to places that you have to be with a lot of people you could be with your friend when you are doing community service like helping a teacher the teacher might need to helpers so you can ask your friend if he/she wants to go with you so you could not be by your self. community service it is also good because the way you are not always in your house trying to figure out what are you going to do because your bored or you will not be just laying down in the bed or in the sofa playing video games or watching a movie because over time that will get boring for you and it will affect your healthy so that's why its good to do community service even ones a week or in a month its not bad to do community service I do community service all Sundays and sometimes over the weekend it is so fun to do community service because i spend some times with my friends with out going to the mall or anything like that so it will be good for other student to do some community services so they can see that it is not boring to do them. so i will like to tell you principal that you should put students to do community services so they could see how good and fun it is . i will like to say that is fun to do because sometimes you are like what should i do today or what i am going to do tomorrow and you get so stress that you don't even know what to do so sometimes when you are like that and you have to do community service it would not be that hard for you to stress. you can also help your mom doing something it would be good for her to you be helping here to your dad to because sometimes your dad its tired of working and he will ask your help so you could help him and that will also can be community service because your helping your parents so that's why i thing you should put student to do the community service.

There are always stores along the board walk that have amazing things for people to take back home. One place I would love to visit is Virginia Beach because the wonderful water. I would spend all day on the beach and most of the night on the amazing board walk.

When I would spend the day on the beach I would ride the big waves on my stomach even tho it hurts but its still fun. Also, I would go boggy boarding because its hard to stay on if you don't time when to jump on the wave right, I would usually bring my own board from home but the waves are so strong mine would brake and I would always have to buy a new one over there. My all time favorite thing to do is play on the sand when I to tired of being in the water for too long. I would usually build a long and tall sand castle then run throw it and get my mom mad because I just got sand all over her. Then my dad would dig a big whole in the sand then put me in it while my brother holding me down my dad would cover me with sand so that just my head would sick out, they would usually leave me in there for about 20 minutes or so

Most night there would be a band playing outside next to a Sonic fast food outdoor restraint and they would have a game where people can win two free meals if you guess how many Jolly ranchers are in the jar. Then me and my dad would rent bikes and ride all around the board walk for like an hour or so to see everything that is there. Once it hits like 10:30 my brother, sister, and I would go on the sand and find cool stuff on the ground with flash lights then we would all sit down, listen to music and talk for about two hours. At like 12:00 we would go back to the hotel and while my mom and dad sleep we would sneak out and go eat out at the 24/7 all you can eat restraint.

However, the opposition overlooks an important view, namely that since there are students who wouldn't be interested in the slightest, there would be some that are intrigued. If schools didn't have a partnership with a company then students wouldn't have been able to find their future jobs.

Due to this, students would have found a job they like. They wouldn't have any difficulties searching for a job if school had partnership. By working at a job they really like, it'll be easy for them to finish through any work they have.

With the partnership, students, who found an employment they like, can work at their dream job. They'll be able to success through their careers.

10ECA491D66C,"I disagree that someone can change you. First of all nobody can change the person you are from the beggining. Second of all no body can tell you how to be or what to do either even if your married or single. Third of all you have to be who you are you don't need to pleasure no body in this world but yourself. You have to be proud for who you are and what you are doing in order to be doing good in your ways of life.

To begin with I disagree that someone could change. One because that's for you to decide if you wanna be the way you want to be. You can't change for anybody to accomplish whatever you want. If you want to change you'll have to change on you know nobody can that for you.

For example when I was a freshmen in high school I used to like skipping my classes all the time. I never went to my classes I liked being around my friends most of the time. My grades drops from 100 to 50 real fast. I didn't realize friends can make you go the down road. I felt like I did not care in the moment but then I realized all those friends were not real friends at the end.

Nobody is going to help you get you stuff together, your grades, your education. I believe you have to always be your self in order to progress and success in your own life.

Secondly people say that when you get married your suppose to be someone else that your suppose to cook at all times, do laundry for you partner and yourself, I believe that is not correct. I believe that you can still be who you are even if your with someone or not. You don't nessecarly have to be someone your not in order to make others happy. Your friends, your boyfriend or girlfriend are not going to give you a High school diploma, an apartment, a car, and food. You have to get that on your own you have to be happy the way you are. If you are a lazy person, crazy person, dramatic person, you can be how ever you want to be. You do not have to change to make the rest happy.

For example I do not like being around friends anymore, I do not like drama at all that is just me I learned from my experience that no body is going to be there for you on your rough times and it is not worth changing for no body ever.

Lastly I believe you have to be who you are and be yourself in order to success and follow your goals. Being your self is one of the best things there could be. You do not need to care if someone judges you. You do not need to be worried about anything but trying to accomplish your goals, your dreams and a better life style. You have to have a good character in order to achieve everything you want and especially being positive to yourself. Never let others try to change who you are or what you want to be always go by what you want and do not question your self. You have to be happy by the way you are and not think about how the rest want to see you.

For example when I used to skip class in freshmen year in high school my friends wanted me to be like them they wanted me to skip at all times and just hang out in them mall or park. I realized one day I want to get somewhere in life I want to graduate on time, I want to have a good job, I want something different for my self. I realized I was doing my self wrong so I stop completly and started of my sophomore year fresh and different. I began to see the difference. My friends thought I changed and I did because I did not want to stay back with them I wanted to move on forward with my self and goals I had. This was my experience and ever since I realized being your self is a big worth anyone has.

This is my opinion on why I disagree that you do not need to change for anybody. You always have to remain being the way you are and never let no one change the character you are just to make them feel happy. Even if you are with friends, boyfriend or girlfriend you do not have to change the way you are for them. Always be proud of the person you are too. ",2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5
11402548A471,"Does true self-esteem come from praise or does it come from achievement?

True self-esteem comes from praise because it can be motivating to students,it helps them want to learn more, and it helps the student to achieve any goal even if the work is not the students effort.

one reason why motivation can help a student build self-esteem is because when you feel that you're not able to do something, but if you have someone who's there with you, you are motivated to keep on going, to keep trying harder until you achieve the goal that you want.

For example, the first time that I took the W!SE test I didn't pass the firs time and I was close to pass, but I had my mom who told ""don't worry you're smart and I know that you will pass the second time"" and those words motivated me and it helped me to studied more and then when I took the test the second time I passed. Therefore, motivation can help students to build self-esteem and to achieve any goal.

Another reason why praising students can help build self-esteem on them is that they may want to learn more if they got someone who's always supporting then and help them to keep trying, for example, when I was in elementary school I used to get really bad grades, but I've always had my mom who has always supported me in anything and she told me that I could get better grades because I was smart to achieve any goal and it helped me to keep learning and I was motivated to get better grades, in middle school I started to get good grades and now in high school I've got better grades than I used to get in middle school, therefore, praising students helps to build self-esteem on them and it help them to want to keep learning more.

In addition, praising students can help them to achieve any goal even if the work is not the students best effort, it helps them to keep trying harder even if things don't go well and it helps them to never give up.

For example, English is not my first language and It was hard for me when I came to America because I couldn't understand anything, I couldn't communicate with other people who didn't spoke the same language as me. When I first came to America I didn't like to speak English because it was hard for me to pronounce each word, but I had to learn English to communicate with other people.

I used to cry because I couldn't understand anything, I couldn't even say a word in English, but I had people who always told me not to worry because I was smart and that I was going to learn English that really helped me to build self-esteem on me, I don't speak English perfectly, but now I'm able to understand and to communicate with other people.

Therefore, it is important that we got people who are there to support us and to motivate us to keep trying hard no matter how hard it is or how hard it looks.

Praising students builds self-esteem on them, because that gives them motivation to keep trying hard to achieve any goal, it motivates them to keep on going and to learn more each day, with people who motivates students, it does not matter how hard things are, they just want someone who is there to support them in anything. There are some students who don't like giving up, but sometimes if there is nobody who helps them to keep going they will stop trying, because they need motivation, they need someone who is there whenever they need them.

My mom had always supported me and I know that she always be there for me, she will always motivate me, that builds self-esteem on me because I know that I have someone who will always support me and that helps me to keep trying harder and to never give up. If we got people who praise students, then they're going to build self-esteem on them.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0

I agree that homework club is good therefore all the students how go to home work club are getting good grades.

If you are a teacher how is reading this what are your opinion about homework club. A teacher probably want what good for there students and they want to work after school with them.

ones I went to homework club I got help by the teacher and she help me to understand the subject that we were working on. Then the next day I went again to the homework club to study for the test that I have the next day.

I took the the test, when i got the test back I got a 100% on the test, ever since that day I went to homework club every day. The only bad thing you should worry is what if the students are only going there to talk with there friend after school.

I think that homework club should be add to every school so they can improve there school. When then other school how good your school is doing they are going to copy what your doing then the further of the students will be good so they can get good job and improve the world some way or another. The county will look at your shool and will give you more mony then you can improve the homework club and make your school better.

Therefore homework club is good for the students and I will give you a advice. You need to have a homework club for your school so they will have a opportunely to pass there classes. If you do not a agree about having homework club for your students. If you do put homework club in your school you will see the improvements in your school like grades and, student beaver. I hope you add a homework come for are school so we can improve are grads and, do better in are classes.      ",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0
125C1167A84A,"Mrs. Generic_Name i think changing the school menu is a very bad idea because the students will not have many choices of what they wanna eat in the cafeteria. so the student wouldnt get to eat what they like or of their favorite choice what the student usually get when they are in the cafeteria. and the students wouldnt be happy about changing the school menu and most student would go to school and not eat lunch and go home with their stomach empty.

so Generic_Name i would not recommend not changing the school menu because. the student would not be very happy at school and if the school menu changes. mostly the student would will bring their own lunch from home and bring it in to the cafeteria and the school lunch food would be wasting . because the students wouldnt eat the school lunch food because majorly the student are bring their own lunch. which its not a very bad idea because students can bring their own lunch and they will not be starving to death with out skipping lunch and going going home with their stomach full instead of empty which it is a good thing. so i think not changing the school menu is a very good idea because friend and i can have free choices of what i like to eat and what the whole school would like to eat or bring the Owen lunch to school which i think it a very good idea because if i had the freedom to to bring my own lunch or choice in the cafeteria. i would eat very well and i wont have an empty stomach the whole entered day in school. and i will not be sleepy for the rest of the day and the few class i have at the end of the day.

i think sum of the students will do the same thing as me if we all eat very good and very well in school in the cafeteria and it will be nice.

Mrs. Generic_Name i think that most student would not like to have a healthier school lunch menu becuase no student usaly get school lunch in school so the students usaly bring in their own school lunch and which its a very good go idea because the student can bring what they like to eat during lunch time .and if you change the school lunch menu then the student wouldnt get school lunch any more. and if the whole school didnt jget the school lunch any more because they dont like the new school lunch menu. it because no one like to eat very healthy at school and maybe if the whole school didnt get lunch and every single student in Generic_School pack their own lunch with its a bad sin becuse all the food would be wasting . so mrs Generic_Name pelase dont change the school lunch menu becuase most student wouldnt be happy if the school lunch menu changes and every every student in Generic_School would be so happy and glad if you didnt change the school lunch mean.

125CD13D5FA4,"Splash splash there I was drowning when the life guard saved me but that was a long time ago. in that situation having the skill of swimming would've been good but at the time I was young. Everyone has a talent or a skill? do you have a talent or skill that you have practice for or worked so hard for that skill? Well one of my strongest skills is swimming

You know not everyone can swim right well now I can unlike the time I was drowning well from that experience I have learned not to jump in the deep side of the pool. Well I can swim and an important talent to have or else you will probably end up like me but swimming is one of my talents I love swimming and i'm good at it and i learned to swim by myself.

Although talents and skills are nice to have but some times you just have to work for them like if you want a skill that requires a lot of effort then you have to prepare yourself. Practice and practice it makes perfect trust me thats why every one says it, because its true and thats why i'm such a strong swimmer. Every time that I went to a pool or river to have fun with my family I always tried swimming failed a lot but every time I fell I would force myself to get up and try once more.

takes a lot of work and money to be a good swimmer. In the summer I always begged my mom to go to the pool sometimes she took me and sometimes not but for the times that we went I put all my effort into it. Effort, effort is a big part of obtaining a skill. It all just depends on your part of the process. The process mite be long or the process mite be short it all depends .

in conclusion every one has a talent or skill. skills and talents take time, practice, and effort, what talents and skills do you have and if you dont like the skills and talents that you already have learn anther one it doesnt take much.      ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0
134937CE445C,"""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.""

Introverts can easly feel identificated with Waldo's words, in a world where the majority goes in the same diretion trying to convince themslves that the way they are taking is the best, it is just a fantacy, but sadly unique, and genius people are afected by the same.

As time passes most of us we still refusing to be like the rest of society; I trully belive that being yourself is more importar than a life lacked of happiness.

As we growing up we been told how to be, and who we have to be like, but only people who resists and face world's opinion can really know deeply what self-acceptation is. It is not about ego, it is about reallity. God, Universe or whowever gave us life, also gave us a purpose. Being different is not a crime, but a privilege, so we have to take advantage of it. Life has a lot of perspectives, just because they are right, does not mean I am wrong.

Before my favorite artist passed away, he used to say: ""I rather to be hated for who I am, than be loved for who I am not."" well, I think Emerson would love this quote. People that choose a diferent direction are usually called: black sheep, weirdos, misfits, and even crazy. In most of the cases they end up being rejected, just because how they look, how they dress or how they think. but it is a fact that no long they become the most greatness, successfull and happiest people in the world, and there is a few of them. well, I guess no pain, no gain.

I know is hard to be yourself when all these people are judging, in my opinion it is a really big accomplishment being yourself, even in these modern times. I never understood why we have to be like someone else just to be accepted in this cruel society but I know for fact that being myself is the best feeling I've ever felt, so I trully believe that being yourself is more important than a life lacked of happiness.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5
13AB4CC7F80F,"I like to play my instrument,because I like the relaxing songs we play. And my older brother use to play the violin so that's two reason why i started to like instruments so much. And I been trying to learn how to play the violin for a while now. I also learn how to play old to joy which is a amazing song in my opinoin. My new music teacher this new year has very been pushing us to our limit which is great because he could help us on the parts we don't know how to play yet. Moon night is a old music sheet that we still play. The music notes on it are really hard to play, LIke on line number four and ten. It seems like i'm been getting better in just a short amount of time which my teacher and brother are very proud about. If i do master the violin i'm gonna try the paino next and my reason for that is just to play it on a rainy down and I know which song to play and it's called thank you by dido, it's such a lovely song to play when it's raining outside. Also i heard a song called happier which I been trying to play this week. I wonder what kind of jobs i can get if I keep going down this path, hopefully it's a good paying job. Instruments are good educational activitys becasue it makes people to try over and over again until they get it right which is very hopefull ti those who want to keep trying. My brother haves been takeing his time teaching me how to play the violin because he nocites that i been playing it lot or he had nothing else to do. The good thing about instruments it teaches you that things take time and partices to learn just like most things in the world which is really hopefull.

And ever instrument teaches you something a little different from one another which I find it amazing that each instrument has new to explore on it. Also in the world of music you can your music you just need to take your time with it. When you do that song can become the next big thing. Plus you can your feelings into the song and playing from the heart is what music is all about. Playing from the heart can be a little odd to most people, and most people are shy about it as well. And stundents can help each other parts of the music sheet so the teach won't have to waste his time ever stundent who dosen't know a part. Learning how to play a instrument it enjoyable and a new to learn something new, Which every teacher wants from their stundents correct? Also buying music sheets is also a way to go out to world and see whats going on. Which music your mind is your only limit, well that's what my music teacher saids anyway. Plus you might go into a collage for free if your very good at playing your instrument. Which is really amazing that could happen. And i think theres clubs for playing imstruments so stundents can learn which each other with things that they don't know yet which could be a huge help for them and maybe later on as well. Also if they have someone in thier famliy knows how to play a instrument they can teach them as well, and maybe even more.",3.0,2.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0

14CC79B9F334,"I agree with Emerson's statement because we have always to be like we are all the time. We dont have to pretend be other person just to like someone . For some people be yourself is hard. Sometimes we do things that we never do just to have more friends and that is bad. We dont have to try or pretend be cool or acting different just for that. I think that be yourself is an accomplishment. In the world is a lot of people that you can talk quite freely, but those people sometimes are hypocrite because they are acting like they are people that you can trust. People who sometimes do not look good or something can be better than people who look kind.

I am food runner in a restaurant and literally most people loves me in there. I have been working for 6 months in there. All that I have to do is be food runner, but sometimes I help the servers and if I help them is because I wanted. they sometimes say thank you, sometimes they say nothing but I do not care that. and one day one server asked me about why you help them and I said I am just been myself and I

like it.

I think if one person is good doing something and that person decide to do that all the time, that person can achieve too many things.

When I was 9 years old I start to play soccer, and when I turned 10 I tried to enter to the team of my city where I lived, and I could not enter to the team. Some people probably should make a decision to leave everything, but when I see that I could not enter to the team I tried to be better for the next time, and the next year I achieve to enter to the team, and what I think is the importance to be yourself be positive. After play 1 year in the team of my city the next year the coach of the state team talked to me and he said that he was watching me all the time when I was playing, and he said that I am a really good player, and that he wanted me in his team .When I make the decision to go to the new team my friends told me that they are going to miss me. They wrote a letter saying thanks for you friendship and for be an example that all that we have to do is ""to be yourself"" and go for what do we want to do, and I told them that if we do what we want everything is going to be easy and fun.

the phrase to be yourself means that we have to be always how we are not change or pretend be other person just for have more friends or something, and if we do something that we like do it. If we do that we are going to accomplishment everything.",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5
14ED79D68BC4,"I think if we never try something new we will never are going to grow more. I'm agree with

Emerson's because in this life the point is to try new ideas new experiences is not only stay in one place like if I already have something why can't try something different if I can move more far than where I am for example if I never try something that I always have wanted how am going to know what it's feel. One reason if I already have a mastered in something how im supossively to grow if I never have try it before how I will know if I am good for it Ifor not

I never try before.

Example If I am a person who has a mastered in bussines and I am able to have my own company but Iam scared to try how I am supposively to grow If I don't try I will stay in the same place where I srtart because is does not matter what I am mastered fpr it if I don't try I f I don't take the risk if I am not confident in my self. Unless I try to do something that I already have mastered I will never grow. I think everything depends in our own personallity because there are person that they are already old but some times they regret their selfs because they never try somethint that they could try it when they were young but now is to late for them I think those kind of things are important in life is not only a bachilletor degree is what you want in life is something that if you don't try is gonna stay in our lives forever and we wiil never are going to see that.

Another example for this is that we always have to go beyond that what we already know we never can stop in one place we need to keep going because there are more things to discovered and the more fast we are moving the more fast we start growing it. So every time we need to keep in mind that everything that we do is what is going to make us to look different then others and always be beyond in everything. ",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5

15968BD9B40A,"Some schools have programs where younger students can work with older students. For example, At my school there's homework club right after school. Teachers of all sort of subjects come to the libary and help out with your questions. The teachers also let you communicate with any grade level students. So I think that students of all ages should interact with each other.

So I think it can help younger students understand if they can't capture the meaning or they need an older student to clarify for them. Because younger students look up to the older students. Meaning that when there the oldest in the school or one of the oldest, they can help out kids/students who need help and use the same strategy that the older student tought them when they we're younger. So then, the younger students would always wanna go to the programs that the older students go to for some help.

It benefits for the older students because, For example, If one of the students wanted to become a teacher and is really shy, Then they can work on their communication skills on the younger students and become more secure about them selves and become a teacher. For example, When they were teaching they young ones, they could use that exact same stragety when they were ""teaching"" when they were young.

It defenitly can help both because, It can help with communitcation skills and meet new people you've never meet i your life, And then later on in the future you'll become really good friends with them. This can help out a lot not only one way but a lot, Because if you're the young one then you still have a long way to go. And if you're the older one then if you thought you can pursue your teaching carrear then you still have a chance to be a teacher in life.

In conclusion, My essay was yes. Why? Because some younger students parents didn't go to school, or finished school. So they have no one to ask for help. But this isn't only for homework club, this can be for any activty or program there's in the school. It can be sports,cooking, teaching, ect. For example, If you played a sport and you were the youngest, you can ask the oldest for help. Like how can i improve my skills, or how can i improve my passes, ect.

15F6B5C6229A,"I will agree with the Emerson's statement,but this can depend too the point view. This is one of the example:

There is a men who is an entrepreneur and he have a little company,and he decide to make it more big,but he don't know if he is going to do it. If you don't try to do it you will never grow, you have to do new things for you know you will have to try something beyond of you already mastered.

The way I understand this is if you don't try to do something that you already know, you will never learn a new things that you don't know,because there is not way to grow if you don't over pass your self or you don't try it and that is going to provoke that you can't advance to grow or even stock in the way you try to make to grow.

Example: When I was 15 years old, the only thing I did was just studying. Although when I start to think about my future and then I figure out I have to do more than just studying, I have to choose which college I'm going and work to earn money for I can pay my college and expenses I have in my house or personal,because you have to do something for you can over pass your goals or you will never grow.

But some people maybe think or have different opinions about this,perhaps people say like its a lie or you can't do it because it's impossible and also that is fake. Every one don't thing the same, maybe they a different point to see it,they just don't want or they have a another way to grow. The majority of people are going to say yes,because they already lived the moment that if you want to grow, you have to go beyond of the things you already know or you'll never going to trust your self.

My opinion is that maybe this wrote of Emerson is true and the reason why i'm saying this is that you have to do things new and over pass your self ,and doesn't matter if you already mastered something,if you want to grow you have to try it because you can't grow if you don't do different things that you have not idea about how you can grow and make or dominate more things that you can't believe.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.5
161779A176BD,"Many people argue about how there shouldn't be a long summer break because students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. But I do not agree to this argument , because I know that having a long break makes students accomplish more things in life. For example There is many students that have not seen one of their family members in a long time and most of them don't have that time to even say hi to them and why? well because sometimes the schools do not provide a longer breaks and they are so busy trying to focus on school work and get everything done on time that they forget even on their own name.

In reality not everyone is going to have things planned for summer break. There's still students that prefer making their vacation useful. They make they time valuable by taking classes online. And the reason to this is that they might want to graduate early so that they get out of school and maybe have more time to think about their future and what they want to study in college. For me this is a great opportunity to manage time and use it correctly. But even though not all students prefer doing it they still succeed in school and they will accomplish too. Educators say that students are more likely to forget information that they have learned in school after they come back from their good time. And the answer to this is yes thats true but that doesnt mean that all the information goes to waste, because that's why there is technology to help us remember things that we might have forgotten and also their is still teachers that can answer our questions if we have some. And not only the teachers can help, there is so many things were we could get information from like going to the library, asking a friend, asking a teacher , dictionary , and the internet.

Another example is that after coming from summer break some students also feel relief because they didn't worried about having to turn in school work or an assignment being late, the main thing that a lot of students hate is, waking up so early and being stressed . But with a vacation they could save some energy they could sleep more and they can relax and enjoy their break. For me personally I don't really like waking up in the morning because of how tired I am with so many assignments that I am not able to rest as much. Sometimes I even fall asleep and wish to get a break from school because I feel so weak and I feel like my brain is going to explode if I do not get a break and thats only going to happened if you never get a break but if you do then you are ready to go and learn.

Last but not least students are able to work during summer they could get a part time or a full time job. This would be so helpful for many students that have fees to pay to the school , or just in general. They could get a chance to pay for things that they might need in school and classes or they could work just to get some extra money. After summer break is over they can keep the job for only part time or they could go and focus again in school .

To conclude I agree that having a 3-4 week break in the summer , a winter break and a week off spring and fall is the best idea. Because we are like cars if you put gas on them they will take you anywhere you'd like but if you don't they will not move until you put gas in it. Same as us if we do not get breaks we will be tired everyday but if you do give us time to relax outside of school we will be more successful and we could accomplish more things. And this is why I believe having a longer break sounds a good idea. ",4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0
163A54729CAA,"Other people would say that failure is a way you learn about your mistakes and where you can improve. Being successful isn't necessarily a way of failing so much it's a way to show that your trying and trying while not giving up. I would have to agree on Mister Winston Churchill about ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" In other words, I believe being the person whos mistakes or failures is someone successful because they didn't give up they believed on they're selves and continued to work harder.

First, when you seem to fail everytime but, you just keep believing in yourself that's how you know you want to be successful and when you look back at those days in either high school,work,or even at home. You'll noticed that those days weren't perfect but, it's a way for you to learn about your failures in the end of the day you become someone whose very successful. My parents told me to always believe in myself and to never give up and if you fail over and over then get back up and do better.

Second, it's not just us people who has failures but celebrities also had failures believe it or not. Celebrities went through what we went through. Classmates either said ""your not gonna be famous your just gonna fail."" or "" Your failures won't lead you to be successful you'l only fail again."" They didn't care what they're classmates said they just kept trying and trying until they made it. For an example, Will Smith he kept trying to be successful in the acting world and he once said that if it wasn't for his parents who told him to keep trying he wouldn't be where he is. Jackson Wang, his a Chinese artist who didn't think he'd become successful but now people see him as an inspiring artist who is also in a Korean boy group. So in other words, if you keep failing then keep trying because you'll become someone someday.

In conclusion, Mister Winston Churchill is right about ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". His message about it would bring people to they're feet and not give up. Just keep trying until you made it. Don't every say you can't do it, just keep believing in yourself you can do it.",3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0
163AC455E1DF,"In my opinion i think online schooling wont benefit any student because, you dont have a teacher in front of you explaining what to do. Video conferencing is something different, you basically at school but on a screen. Youll be able to hear the teacher while shes explaining the assignment and teach it to you better so that way you understand more and you can be able to ask questions. Looking at a screen and reading an assignment isnt going to help you much. If you have an actual teacher, she/he goes into details and shows you examples of how to do an assignment. Being home schooled is pretty challenging. Most online schooled kids tend to procrastinate and end up falling behind. Most shy kids are home schooled or video conferencing because of problems or any other thing thats going on with them. If students want to attend online and video conferencing, then thats fine as long as their getting their education and finishing their assignments. Its the law for every student to go to school or to do something thats related to school. Online classes are pretty expensive to pay up, so students must complete their assignments because theyll charge you for it either way. I think attending school would be better. Teachers teach you better and help you out when you dont understand something. You get less homework and maybe even easier homework to do. You dont need to pay anything for your child to go to a public school. Your student gets taught well. So in that case i think going to school is better then online class and video conferencing.

1649A2246587,"Benefits of being home school.

Have you ever felt like you could not handle school?, well let me tell you that you have options, in here you are going to know the benefits of being home school. When I was younger school was a challenge for me; There was always conflicts at school and the environment was really a distraction, not good for me. Attending to school from hone have a lot of benefits. Students are going to be more focus in their studies and they are going to understand the meaning of responsibility.

One of the reason why home school it's good for students is going to be that students are going to be more concentrate and focus on their studies. Students manage to work better if they are alone, since they do not have any distraction around them like: drama, bad influences, mean teachers, stress and so much more. This is really good for those students who want to get their stuff done and learn more efficiency. So attending to school from home is one good option for those who want to focus on their studies.

Responsibility is one of the most important skill that us like humans have to have. Being responsible is a hard skill to follow but it is the most important one since we use it on the daily bases. If students attend to be on home school they have to learn that is not easy and they have to be really responsible because they are not going to have a physical teacher in front telling them what to do. Therefore you have to get it by their on hands and learn the meaning of being a mature and a responsible person. Students are going to be more responsible because if thy have any project, homework or test they are going to manage the way to study and do their stuff by them self and using the tools of their online program.

I understand that some people may disagree and prefer students to go to a normal school since they are going to have more social life. Having social life it's really important but who said that being in home school means that they are not going to have any social life, it's the opposite because if students are all caught up with their things they are going to have so much time to hang out with friends and family.

In conclusion the benefits of being home school are really good since students are going to focus on their own things and studies also they are going to learn how important it's to be responsible. now days we use technology for everything because it let us have a lot of more options if people is struggling with school. so more schools should include some online programs for students who want to continue their studies from home.

Buying items that are needed in life is all about what you want and what your instincts tells you. Buying houses or what bank account you want is what you should decide. All that has to do about your life's matters it's your choices and instincts. Everyone wants the best for themselves and want to be self-reliance.

Decisions that are decided for yourself and ideas you come upon on should always be followed. Your life matters is on your hands we do and know whats best for ourselves and the choices we make throughout our life is what we want, and not seeking to others to make the choices for your life. Overall people who value self-reliance know exactly what you want and know whats best for themselves.                   ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5
1736153EF81F,"Well, I feel that working with a group is better than working alone. In my opinion is more easy to work with other people and you can be sociable working like that ,there's a lot benefits and reasons why I prefer more work together than work alone. Let me explain what are my reasons why I prefer work in a group and why I don't like to work alone.

First of all, I prefer work together because is more easy and you can finish your work quicky. For example, is you work in group of three, one member can search for the information about the topic, another member can make a poster showing examples about the topic and the last one has to organize how they are going to present and explain the topic. However, if I work alone I have to do all the work by my own, and it can takes a lot time to finish the project.

Second of all, Working together is so funny you can talk with your classmates about the topic, and having good discussions. I feel comfortable working in a group and I enjoy working like that, because they share their opinions with you, even you can learn more from your classmates than the information of the topic, it can be strange,but it is true you don't know how much they know about the topic. Sometimes you can't understand the topic, but you have your group and ask questions to them, and they can help you to understand the topic.

Third of all, Working in groups can be sociable, you can have a good time knowing new people and make new friends. I think is good be sociable because you can learn new things about them and you can develop your knowlege getting the new information from your classmates. For example, if you don't know anythink about history and you are in a group, and you ask who knows something about history and someone likes history you can aks him about it, and you can get new information about history and at the same time you are being sociable. However, if you are working alone, you can't ask to anybody because you dont know them.

In conclusion, that's are the reasons why I prefer working in a group. Working together can be easy you can share the work with your group, you can have a good time with your classmate talking about the topic , and you can develop your friendship making new friends.",3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5

Imagine your school cafeteria plans to change to a new, healthier school lunch menu, which would eliminate some of the students' favorite cafeteria foods. Many students wouldn't want to eliminate some of there favorite cafeteria foods. Therefore, I believe healthier school lunch menu you could benefit students at school, at work, and at home.

Dear, Dr. Generic_Name

My name is Generic_Name, I am a freshman at Generic_School. I would like to talk to you about a healthier school lunch menu. Ever since these 4 months have passed I've been eating the school lunch. Every time I eat the school lunch, after 30 minutes I would go to the restroom. The food wouldn't sit right nor feel right in my stomach.

The issue isn't just with me, my friend Generic_Name has an allergic reaction whenever he eats something from the school lunch menu. I believe it would be a good idea to have healthier school lunch menu. Because half of our students at Generic_School are obese. Even you know all the food your providing for us is junk food. The pasta has puddles of oil, the burgers don't taste like real meat, the orange chicken isn't even cooked well. All the food you are providing for us is microwaved food.

Instead of all these microwaved food. We could have similar foods as the ones we have right now for the lunch menu. The foods you feed us should be organic like the bread, meat , spaghetti , etc. The school lunch should be worth $3.75. Dr. Generic_Name instead of thinking about yourself think about us a little bit more. Imagine yourself sitting down at the lunch table seeing a puddle of oil on you're pasta tray. Imagine eating rock hard french fries. Please think about it and call me into your office if you ever want to talk about this issue that 75% of the students are having here at Generic_School.

1BA1FD29BF69,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change.

I agree that the first impressions are the ones that are impossible to change, because impressions from other person can make you feel proud for that person, and impressions from other people about you can just make you feel good and happy for what you are doing, for your hard work.

Reason of why the first impressions are impossible to change, is when you find those negative and envy people, that does not want you to be successful in life, and when the time came at your favor and you start to begin success in life, there is when you start to see those good impressions from those negative and envy people, and that just can make you feel happy and proud for the hard work that you did, that is why is almost impossible to change those impressions, because not matter what you showed them you always looked forward, but still don't hate them, love them as God loves everyone in this world.

No matter what give good impressions and show them, let them know that they are working hard, people who works hard deserve good impressions, make them feel proud for what they are doing, and also no matter what give good impressions, show people how hard worker, how positive, how respectful person you are, show them that you always look forward not matter what, so when other people talk bad stuffs about you, your ones does not going to believe or change those good impressions from you, because you already showed them that good impressions you keep with you...",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5
1C1E049AB15F,"A famous quote once said by Thomas Jefferson ,""Determine never to be idle . . . it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". Off this quote i feel that sometimes in life you can accomplish things with no effort but mostly, in life you gotta work hard to earn and get the things you deserve and have well accomplished in life. Another thing is that you gotta have a really good effort in life to get really far. I agree with Thomas Jefferson's quote on,"" how much maybe be done if we are always doing"" because that's how it has to be done in life , you gotta work for what you want and need, everything is earned in life and it's way easier to get things that need to be done quicker by putting your effort and always working, than to just be standing or laying around doing nothing.

One main reason i agree with Thomas Jefferson's quote is that you gotta work for what you get in life,you gotta always be doing something to get stuff done. It's an amazing quote that is used in a way that many don't think or have had the thought of. His quote is supporting the fact that it takes hard work and focusing to get work done and that work wont get done on its own.

Another reason , is that no matter what you do , you always gotta work in life. To not take things for granted and actualy work and to not be lazy and get no work done that has to be done, done . It'll help out in the long run and make things easier in life by doing what you have to. Thomas Jefferson's qoute is there to incourage others to do great in life and do everything possible to get your goals achivied. This quote is a great figure of speech that can help out in the long run for people in need of it.

One last reason i believe thomas jeffersons quote is a great and an amazing quote is that it justifys that life isn't easy and everything isn't free, also that things come with consequences. To also, not take things for granted and be grateful for what you got because that's the amount of effort you put in , instead of just laying down and or doing nothing at all. The quote has a alot of great reasons and thoughts that are put into peoples minds off this one quote it could help motivate someone in need of motivation.

In conclussion, Thomas Jefferson's quote can help people that are in need of something to motivate them. To help them by telling them that it's fasinating to see what you get out of completing your work by always doing something. Lastly, how easily it is to complete something by moving around and not just sitting and down absolute nothing about your work.

It is possible for a human to forget his/her first impression because all human forget. we easily forget small simple things for example people can just do stuff and later on in the day and forget about it easy. Many people can't remember there first childhood friend so am against that first impressions are impossible to change it is possible to change. Am against it myself I forget everybody forgets things but not all of us do but a lot does.

Sometimes we purchase things and forget that we did tell we see the package in our doors or mail box then we gonna realize that we purchase something and forget about it. Is the same way how you can forget about your first impression. I myself can't tell who was my childhood best friend or my first dogs name. a lot of us don't know when we got married with our wife or husbands a lot of us don't even know some of our grandparents names is lot if things that we easily forget in life so easily.

Am against it because i so it my self people forget easily a lot and there will be no human who will stand and say i don't forget or i know everything in life all what i have learn since my childhood life i can still say it and tell you all about it that is not possible. A lot can say stuff like that will not be able to do or say about it.

Not every individual need's others to make them feel comfortable. Some person's like to be realistic and not hear lies. Praise others people's job's even if is not excellent can bring them fake happiness and hurt them.

Some people think that the most important thing in this world is to give people self-steem, by praising their work even if is not good at all. Others believe that it can helps people to be sure about them selves even is the rest of the pople think's the oppositive. Still others ague that given every individual praise about what they do is the greatest accomplish people can make.

People should not need other's to praise their work to have self-steem, Sometimes individuals do not gonna have others to tell them how great their work is, But the person have to know if the stuff is valid or not. People do not have to depend on other's people's opinions. They need to learn skills by their own selves and know when they can fix oh make better something. At the end of the day nobody is going to try to make others feel good so people have to be successful with their own self.

Althought, People need to be realistic with their own selves, If the person is smarth and they know what they are doing and they do not need anybody to correct them that's all good. If people know they are doing wrong and somebody comes to tell them that they are doing great just to make them feel great!! Do not accept that, beause people need to be honest with their selves, All people need somebody to tell them how to became better. Sometimes being honest with someone can hurt them but is the best way to help those individuals. People have to become better to feel better with what they are, And not let anyone praise somethings that can be better.

Finally, Praising other's people's work even if is not great can bring them fake happiness, and make them feel proud of their selves when the work that they did is not good enough. Being fake with someone can make them to become weak, and make them to not putt effort to make it better. That's why everybody in this world should be honest with others, Some poeple at the end of the day ended with their self-steem down, becuase somebody lied to them , And when they present their's works's peoples's opinion's can hurt them really bad.

Student's should not need anybody to tell them how great they are doing their work to have a really good self-steem, Every individual should know when they are doing good or when they are having some problems, Every person in this world know when they can put more effort to things that they are doing wrong. People should not let anyone lied to their selves, Not everyone need's others to make them feel comfortable. Some person's like to be realistic and accept when something is wrong so they can fix it. Praise others people job's even if is not excellent can bring them fake happiness, and thats whe worse feeling ever. That's why all people need to know how do great things and impact others by their talent, without letting anyone hurt those endividuals at the end.

surfing,scuba-diving,camping,hiking,rock climbing, and snow boarding. However,the most people enjoy doing are skateboarding and bike riding. Mostly,during the summer,friends gather around the neighborhood and teach themselves how to skateboard and bike ride.

However,most parents disagree with having their children ride bikes and skateboard. Most parents think that their children are going to get abducted,raped,kidnapped or get hurt. Some parents also think is a good idea for their to children to skateboard and ride bikes outdoors,so they can cope with talking to people. Well I think is a bad idea for children to ride and skateboard in the Summer alone without parental guidance, because it takes a lot of training and focus to bike ride or skateboard. Some people can even scuba-dive if they have the experience. Most people like to spend time outdoors,for example,they can invite some friends over for some barbecue.

People like to spend time outdoors doing fun stuff like Snowboarding. Snowboarding is a cool way of spending time outdoors,because a lot of children like to play in the snow,so snowboarding is a fun way of playing in the snow. There are so many outdoor events like,Easter and partying. A lot of children like to hunt for Easter eggs during Easter,because they find eggs,candy and so on. Sometimes,most people like to go to outdoor-clubbing to chill,relax, and relieve stress. Some other people don't like to spend time outdoors during the night because they either don't have time or they have important things to do.

Mostly,during the Summer,most parents take their children outdoors to teach their kids how to ride their bikes. Eventually,people might find the activities mentioned above enjoyable,because they get to tell their friends their parents thought them how to ride a bike and skateboard,they could assist their friends. People like to spend time outdoors with friends than stay home alone and do nothing. They could try and teach themselves how to ride their bikes. If parents stay outdoor with their children on a campsite,they could make smores with a campfire and enjoy.

In conclusion,people should stay out more often so they can learn how to snowboard,skateboard,bike ride,rock-climb,roller-skating,surfing,camping,hiking,scuba-diving and jet-skiing.              ",3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5

After when me and my OTHER_NAME was at the park picking up the trash we saw these two guys that were throwing food on the floor and I told my OTHER_NAME look those guys are throwing food on the floor so when they left I went and picked up what they threw on the floor cause its important to help the community service. Also sometimes I go to LOCATION_NAME and there is a lot of trash on the floor and when I always go over there with my cousin I always take a bag so i could pick up the trash and food that they have on the floor.

Now let me tell you why it would be more good, first you get to do it in groups and make new friends in the homework club, it makes you more focus in the work that you need to and you can even do it with a group, solo, pairs. and after school homework club is perfect for all those things and it raises your grade up.

all you have to do is...

(1)Ask for your parents permission to join the homework club. (2) try and finish up the work you haven't done yet. And now your done. It even helps the school by you making the school a school where student can grow and learn. if you ask any teachers from our school they would all say that homework clubs are good to help your brain learn more and release that stress that you might have from not doing your work in time and homework club helps you in that.

as a student my self i to have homework and test, and other stuff and sometimes i don't have time to do my homework at home so sometimes i choose my days that i want to stay in homework club for example lets say you want to join a club but you know you have a lot of important work missing then dont choose other electives just choose homework club and then you can choose the elective you want, and with that we should all have home work clubs in each school.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0

You can be yourself, being yourself means to express your feelings to the world but in your own unique way, for example LGBT people they are the people that get the most stuff at them because of who they love, and the stuff they believe in.

People constantly keep trying to make them different, even the government is trying to tell them who they can love and who they can not love, who they can marry, and who they cant.

Expressing yourself in a world of 7 billion people is not easy, because everyone has different opinions and beliefs, you might have different ways to express yourself than your family and that is hard, because when you are young you believe in the same stuff your parents/family does, but the older you get you start to understand more stuff and why your parents believe in what they believe in.

There's a good amount of people who are good at something in life, but never get the opportunity like other's to be successful at it. For example, sports. If your good at sports nowadays, you can easily make it to the big leagues and have a good salary, if and only if, your focus and show that you want it more than others. You gotta be unique in someway. Because if you think your good enough already and sit back and think that there's no one better than you out there, then your wrong. That means your mentality is not set for success, it's set for failure. If you decide to be Idle, you'll lose your chance to make it to the big leagues because there's many people out there who are hungry and are willing to take that spot from you. For example, Ousmane Dembele, former Barcelona player, took the starting spot from Philip Coutinho. Because at practice and some games, Dembele showed that he had what it takes to start over Countinho. Coutinho did suffer an injury, but when he recovered, he pretty much became Idle and Dembele was already far ahead from what Coutinho was when he started.

When you decide that you want to be successful, it's not only good for you, but also for others. Because your setting a good example,for people that look up to you, younger siblings, etc. I'd rather die trying to be successful, than not, because then I know I made someone happy, like my family. Trying isn't going to harm you, matter of fact, It'll get you somewhere in life where It will only motivate you to do more, and become a better person. A person like me, would never become Idle because i've witnessed what happens when a person becomes Idle. Especially High School students. I've seen many students get jobs and lose their interest in school because they've ""found"" an easy way to make money. And many think that they don't need education, that's why I, myself, haven't had the interest to look for a job at the moment. I witnessed my cousin, get a job at Wendy's, going from straight A's and B's, to becoming Idle towards school and finishing the year with all F's and only one D. That's why I encourage students not to get a job right away when they become 16 years old. I would rather wait for the summer, get a job, and make money. Because you can't also sit around and not do anything in the summer.

Everyone gets to that one point in life, where they'll find themselves being Idle, but that's great because they learn from it. They learn what's bad from it, and hope to never be like that. At least I've learned from it. I suffered a bad injury freshman year, which lead to my downfall a little bit because when I came back from the injury, I noticed that I wasn't the same anymore. My team mates were telling me that I'll most likely never be the same again and that another person was gonna take my spot. I took their words, and trained harder than ever. I became a better player than I was, took me a bit of time, but I got there. And that inspired me a lot, I even started playing with better people so that I could learn from them. I pushed myself out side of my comfort zone, but it payed off. I inspired my brother to also become a goalkeeper, he now trains with me every weekend.

Thomas Jefferson states that by always doing something, you'll accomplish more, and it's a wonderful thing when people acknowledge that. I, in fact agree with him, because when you're Idle, you most definitely won't get anywhere in life. There's always something to do out there, for every human being. You just have to push yourself outside of your comfort zone, and do things in life that makes you happy.

i don't agree on talking online claases for whole year while sitting home sometimes you do not know how to solve problems while sitting homw some students do not have a wifi facility at there homes how they are suppose to take classes on online if they do not have laptop or wifi at there house. all the students should come to the school if they want to get education in order to get there diploma. students who do not have any source of coming to school but they do have laptops it can help them to get there diploma while sitting home.

students who got injuries and cannot come to school for 1 month because there doctor gave him or her bed rest for 1 month this option can help him so that he or she do not miss there whole month so that they can keep up with there grades so that he or she do not fall back and they can get there diploma.

some students who work 5 to 6 days in a week and cannot get up early in the morning this program can help them to get there diploma by staying and taking there test online and video conferencing with there teacher. i do not think all schools should start this program we all have to use techonolgy but you cannot learn whole year while sitting home and doing video call you have to be in learning environment to learn someting because when you get to the collage things are tottaly different no one gonna help you if you do not want to learn all the students have to do everthing by there self.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
1F50675D8683,"50% of people say that when you have a problem that its a opportunity to do your best but others dont believe that. ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" I agree because you can prove to your self that you can solve your problems with out any help.

Having problems is giving you a chance to do best. For example, when you have homework and you need help but you want to show your parents that you can do it with out there help just do your best and never give up on your self. Also, you can be doing a quiz and your stuck just do the best and move on.

Sometimes you my feel stuck or confused but always do the best you can. When the teacher is asking you a question and you are confused you can always just try your best. Another example could be like when your taking a test and it has multiple choice just try your best and mover to the next question.

Some people think that problems is a chance to do your best but some people do think that but there are problems that you can have but you just have to do your best and never give up.

1F7FD80F4396,"I totally agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson , being yourself around people of these days is complicated in the way that anything you do or you say is going to be judge by everyone , you will be the critique of your classmates,friends,family. Is basically most of the youth community feeling the pressure of being accepted by the society and they forget to be them and they start becoming someone else, just because the other person might have a lot of friends or they want to have the same popularity as them.

70 percent of the youth community either have depression or they get bully in high school. For the people who sees these type of actions and don't say anything because they are unprotected and are scared to be bully, first know that you can get help and you can be that person giving the courage to the other person feeling same as you.

There are multiple reasons why you should want to be yourself and not just a copy. First put in your mind that you are unique , by the time you grow up the reality will come to show you that you don't need to impress anyone but yourself and all your actions is for you, your mistakes will affect you the most .When you are copying someone you should analyze what you win from it and is it really worth it ?.Now , ask yourself if the friends you have are really your friends,just because they walk with you and they talk to you doesn't mean they are your friends , and worse if they tell you to change who you really are. A real friend is that person that would love you and care about your own good, a friend is the one that appreciates you will all your defects. Someone changing you is someone you surely don't want in you life. Believe it or not is better to be alone than with bad friends,inclusive your own family can talk bad about you ,they might critique everything you dress,eat,but that isn't reason to change yourself and be what they are expecting you to be. When you are going to be a grown up, how can you tell someone to be always themselves when you don't even got to known the value of it.

Being yourself is worth it, is loving who you are you won't be able to love someone else if you don't love yourself before. Having your own thoughts and always giving your honest opinions are good than just agree with something that you don't , being real is being you. Be real with your friends and if they don't like your opinions or they would make fun of you then feel happier that they finally showed their truth colors. If you cousins or any member of your family make fun of you because you unknown any argument they are talking about or they make fun of they way you dress then they aren't family. Popularity is nothing compared to be yourself, somehow in any time you will feel so stressed ,sad ,and down and that'll be because you can't fake no more. Get you own experience, have your own goals in life, create your future. Instead of worrying about being accepted just worry about what you are planing for the future. Be a right person at least, don't copy someone ignorant , be a good well , always appreciate the appraisal of what you parents thought you and don't you ever feel shameless for it. In the future the success will be good recompense .

Lastly be grateful to be unique in the world,be one in a million , always try to improve yourself and instead of going down go up , and if you think that copying someone that you think is up is being a winner you are completely wrong cause you are being a loser, know that there is a lot of mean people that could be around you and you might even call them friends when they aren't .When people is jealousy behalf themselves they can do anything to ruin you when you think they are helping.

1FB89CF59E5B,"Influence can be divided in words, actions, and motivation. Words can give a individual influence. Actions can give a example of what to do, when to do it, and/or how to do it. Motivation has a impact in people's life that can demonstrate influence to others. Some people say that giving a example is the only way to demonstrate influence. By analyzing each paragraph the reader will have a summery about how a example is not the only way to influence people.

Word can give a excellent influence. Many people tend to hear what other influences say. For example a YouTuber called Alpha M teaches young men, or older men to be more succefull. If Alpha M does not have his charismatic character to talk, then many of his public would not listen to what he says. Words can dictate influence if the person knows what is he or she saying. Not only words is a key, but is a fundamental key.

Action is a important key to demonstrate influence in peoples life. Actions tell in a non verbal way how to do certain things in life. For example, Messi, a really famous soccer player, has played soccer since he was 9 years old. His talent has influence many people to be better in sports, and to be better in life. If Leonel Messi did not had the talent to play soccer, then his influence would be less or non. Actions can tell what to do, when to do it, and/or, how to do it. By analyzing actions the reader can tell that actions is a important key, but motivation can give influence to.

Motivation can do many things for influence. It demonstrates character, responsibility, and success and thats what people most want to follow, more in this days. Generic_Name, a police officer, has demonstrated a lot of responsibility in many times. He has been rewarded many times because of his excellent work, and his motivation. His motivation has influenced many people to obey the laws, and to be better in society. If Generic_Name's motivation was not good, then many people would not obey the laws. Motivation can make millions of people to be influenced by one person. Motivation is a key, but some people say something else.

Some people say that giving a example to society is the only way to influence people. Words, actions, and motivation can give a person influence to follow them or motivate them to do something. By giving a example the person is only influencing people in one way. In particular, a teacher from Generic_school tells students to not use their cellphones during class period, even though he gives the example of not using his cellphone, many students still use their device. If the teacher had giving the students the words, actions, and motivation, then the students would be influenced by the teacher's order. Giving a example is part of influencing others.

After reading each paragraph, the reader can have a conclusion that a example is not the only way to influence others in society. A individual's influence can be based by words . What to do, when to do it, and/or how to do it can give example of actions, which gives influence. A individuals motivation can demonstrate influence to others and have a impact in people's life. Some people say that to demonstrate influence, the only thing to do is by giving a example. Words, actions, and motivation are three key factors that can give a person many influence around the world. Not only giving a example, but having this three qualities is important to have influence.          ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0

Every single person in this world make mistakes that means to me that no one in this world is perfect, but we need to learn that is part of learn in life, is something about to be better every day and the enthusiasm is part of learn about our mistakes. It is important to fall down and don't loose our hope because that hope and the enthusiasm make us better persons and that is our impulse to succeed and make our dreams real. We need to think like a winners no matter what is going wrong in our life, take our weakness and make it strengths. My mother once told me because you loose one battle that doesn't mean that you loose the war, that show the importance to don't give me up at any bad circumstance or bad decision that i took before in my life because no one in this life born with all knowledge or born perfect to don't make something wrong. She also show that i have to do my best, to give my hundred percent at whatever that i want do because that is what make us better persons, she show me that don't give me up, be dedicated and passionate in all that i want to reach.

Failure plays a important role in succeed because that is how the apprenticeship start at, what if all scientist they were gave up in their experiments just because they did something wrong in their experiments we probably would didn't have medicines or the cure to a lot of illness or all technology that we have in the actuality or the first people that worked for the NASA with their first rockets that they made it, they get on fire and burned up but they still tried out again until they reach they dream to be the first persons to go to the moon, all they learned from they mistakes, that was the key of their achievements, that is what made us humans learn from our errors.

2010889A6522,"Hello dear reader. In the follows paragraphs I would like to tell you what I think about this issue because i believe that everyone got opinions or some ideas about this new ""proposal"" as well. First, I would like to discuss if this ""proposal' makes sence to me or not and wich are the advantages and disadvantages.

First thing I may say is the advatage and the disadvantage that we probably can see or find in the proposal. One adventage that comes along with this proposal is one schools day less. If the school follows the whole proposal; we can say or expect that friday or anyday will be off; wich means no school for us. In addition, we will have three days free. So, we can spent more time donig what we most love or enjoy. In the other hand, we have the disadvantages. I personally found one hugh disadvantage, the time. I personally think that the time that we will spent in the school is alot. Just think about it , how do you going to fell staying about 10 hours in the same place , spacially when that plece is not home. You might be get uncomfortable, or little irritable.

Secondly, I totally agree with the proposal because we gonna get more help on schools subject wich is good for us. Also we will avaible to do more school activities such as sports, fell trips, math stuff or any other amazing things. Besides, we will learnd more things such as lenguague stuff. like I said in my las sentence more time in the school could works for many of us.

Lastly, One more day free. We gonna spent more time in school, but at the same time we also can get one more day free. Folllowing the proposal we also can get other day free like Saturday or Sunday wich is good for us because that day could be any day of the week. So, this means that we are avaible to do more thinghs that we most enjoy or love, for example, play videogames , go to the park , take wallks and other amazing things.

Conclusion, the new proposal has a good advantages over the disadvantages. I completly agree with this and I am sure the proposal is benefial and will work for us. Also, we will save energy and resources , at the same time we gonna get benefits from it.     ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5

How I think it's necessary that the others peolpe help to them to bring ideas what they need to do for don't be idle can take a long time to improve and have new personality and think different.... Some offices can help them to improve there are many ways to leave of that , In specific the women who are idle in cases thar have children and husband have to leave of that case because many women have to do it all of their work at home if they have their own work already it's other case.

Mistakes help you learn and get better and better until you understand the concept about what you are doing. Some people think that by making mistakes you will fail something, but notes that at the end you will get results from it. A lot of people fail everyday and that doesn't mean that you're not perfect because no one is perfect in these world, but the main idea is to look for the best way to manage or do something and also to keep forward.

Failure is just the key to keep looking forward in these world. We have the opportunity to make mistakes and learn from it, that is how people progress to became someone in the future. failure is a lesson that these world give us to keep learning and at the end to find a solution and continue our lives. however, there are a lot of people that think that failure is like an stop sign that don't let us keep looking forward, but failure is just a process in which people advance to find results that will help them to survive in these life.

Some people stop where they are just because they fail on something, they think that they can not keep going forward just for a little mistake they have committed and they also give up. The word failure doesn't mean that you should stop on what you are trying to do. Failure is a strong word that teach us get up, find the best results and keep living our lives. Failure is a progress in which every person create their own future. By failing people analyzed that they keep learning and at the same time they are creating a better future in which they will have better lives.

I strongly agree getting help form a expert or authority is much better than following your own instincts. Reasons are teacher and therapist; Both help out a lot in peoples life. For example my friend Generic_Name and me.

Therapist help me when I was going through hard times. My family had split up, a good friend pass away, and I got bully in school, so many confusing and terrible events happening which teared me apart. Trying to work so hard fixing everything by myself, but non of my ideas work. Until I talk to a therapist about my problems. The therapist guide me to a better understanding of my life, and what to do next. Together we solve my problem with the bully in school, and help me got over my family split and my friend death.

Secondly, my friend Generic_Name is a senior in high school. She was never good in math, nor did she pass the math SOL. Generic_Name had chances to retake the math sol to graduate. The next one she taking will be the last SOL . Generic_Name study on her own and worked very hard. She like to be self-reliance But at this point it was not working, so Generic_Name ask her math teacher to help out before the SOL. The teacher saw Generic_Name had a lots of mistake, so the teacher guide her to fix it. Also teach her on the math problem she didn't know. Seeking guidance form the math teacher help Generic_Name pass the SOL.

In conclusion getting help form experts or authorities help, in ways being self reliance can't. Seeking guidance help a better understanding of the situation, less mistake, controlling stress, and learn something you did not know.

2265CC4410DE,"Changing the lunches to healthier lunches will effect more then just the cafeterias. It will change how people eat, and changing the food habits which is not good. Some adults and parents might love the change, but as teens it might have to be a nightmare. People having favorite lunches and enjoying what they buy to eat should be the goal. Not having to be inforced to eat healthy food on a daily. The school board should speak, and see all the possible outcomes of this change before making a desicion.

Think of how many kids won't eat anymore, because of this change. Losing some of their favorite foods would change everything. Not only a loss for the kids, but a loss for the school as well. Losing more money as more kids stop buying lunch. This could not only effect the stomach's of the people not eating, but could also effect their learning and how they do in school. Nutrition is a big thing in school, because you need it in your system to function.

Habits are also being changed. Being enforced to bring food from the outside. Some people would probably even leave school. That should be one of the schools biggest fears. They are legally in charge of you at schoool, and if you decide to leave, and something happens to you; that can not be good for the school. There are so many things that could fall into this. People coming in and out of the school with food for others. Random people could indentify as a student due to holding a backpack and having food in their hands, so a student opens a door for them.

Some parents are obviously going to disagree. They want their kid or kids to eat, and do well in school. The amount of complaining will be very untolerable and annoying. There should just be a balance between healthy and unhealthy. For example one line could be serving healthy food, and the other could be serving what they used to be serving. They should be making it work instead of making them unhappy.

I really think everything should be looked over again. Making big time decisions like this could really effect the school. I think many people should have a say in this including high representative students, and very exclusive clubs. Some being National Honor Society, Key Club, and maybe even the the county board itself.

22BF4720FB84,"for this issue, I think attending classes from home by way of online or video conferencing would not benefit. Students would not benefit to attend classes from home because not just for studying in books but we go to school for another reason also, for examples we go to school for getting friends and that mean we have social. And another is we can do activities that we get from some classes.

First, friends form school is the reason that students cloud go to school because they will get a good relationship and that mean they have a socialite. If students attend classes from home they might get just a thing that teacher teach them but they will not get a teamwork when they have any work group form teacher. They will not know how to be a teamwork or working with another people. When they graduate for high and get into college or apply a job and they never used to have a social it will not work for them because they do not know about teamwork or how to live whit a group of people.

Second ,it is about activities for student. When they study,some subject they have to go outside from school for studying ;sure as scenes classes would go to a sea for studying about a sea,so if they go and see a real sea, students might get information more than they get from a book and can feel it. Students should do activities and study in books together it might help students understand.

A talent or skill that I have developed is being able to write in cursive. I develop and use this talent in many ways. In order to develop this talent and use this talent, firstly, I had to practice every single day, observe many other people write in cursive, and lastly I use it to sign many different items.

One way I developed this skill is practicing. I used to spend everyday writing the whole entire alphabet in cursive to perfect how I wrote. I would meet up with my teacher after school everyday for about a month so that she could help me work on my writing. Another thing that I did was rewrite every document or letter that I saw or received to accomplish writing as good as the original writer.

Another way I developed this skill is by observing other people. I would watch many ""How To"" YouTube videos to observe how other people wrote. I would observe how they wrote and I would write very similar to them. Whenever I saw anybody writing in cursive I would study their hand movements and match mine up to theirs to achieve writing perfectly. Any letters that I had received from family members I would examine to figure out how they wrote in such a perfect manner.

One way I have used this skill is by signing my name on many different items. Anytime that I go to the doctor's office I get asked to sign my name and knowing cursive comes in handy. Whenever I decide to write letters to my family I sign my name on the outside of the envelope so they know that it's from me. Also, anything I have painted or drawn has my name signed on it.

Think back at a skill or talent that you have. How did you develop it? How do you use it? Mine is being able to write in cursive. What's yours?",3.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0

23FC0A3DF4C9,"In my opinion, I do believe that it should be an elective classes for students to take art, drama, and music classes because it has nothing to do with our education. It won't help us in the future because all you need to learn is how to get a good job, pay for bill and electricity, food, gas, and water. It has nothing to do with our and it should be optional for students to take any art classes whenever they like the class and the second reason is that students might not like the classes because they will be not be interested and will be bored because art is really not their thing. Students like to listen to music, party, go on social media, sports, video games, talking to friends, and being cool. But they don't want to sit in class with a bunch of nerds that paint, make clay and draw. Students should not be required to take a class they don't like. It should be optional just like band class. Some students might fail the class because they either don't like being there and just skip the class or they're not that good at making clay or drawing. For drama it should be optional too since all you do is make an act and speech and it has nothing to do in students futures. Music class is what students will find most interesting but it has nothing to do with students futures either. These classes are something that are easy, Something that you are good at, and something that interests you. So in my opinion it should be elective classes and not classes that should be required to graduate.",2.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0
253108CDC69F,"hello I hope you have a good day. I will tell you how i am and why you should select me to visit and learn about the work that i am interest because i am very intelligent and i learn fast.

A opportunity is a favorable combination of circumstances. Although some say that the manager should not select me because i don't like to do extra work. Actually,

Manager should select me because i have positive attitude and i will working hard.

First, Some say that you should not select me because i don't like to do extra work. some people exploit yourself when you try to do extra work if you did the first time, so the next time they give you more work to do. However all the people are not the same. For example, my sister work in clean the house she have different type of person, so a women from Generic_City told her to cleaned the toys. My sister just told her OK, but is not her job in the next time she went to clean the women put her to cleaned the garage and she didn't pay.

Second, Some say that you should select me because i have a positive attitude. the people that always have positive attitude they will have success in the life. If you fall you have to get up. In the life you have to learn a lot thing like lose and win not all that time we can win because if you focus to win. One day you lose you will have negative attitude and you cannot doing well you job that why i learned how to have a positive attitude in everything. However this can help you manager for that you have the best company in the world. For example, My friend is going to college and he is study about business. He always told me that the teacher teach to have positive attitude for that they cannot fall in depression if they lose money or something.

Third, I always work hard because i like to do my job perfect. I try to do the best i can because i don't like to leave my job in average. For example, when i went to High Schools i maintained my level in up. I can work in the night if you prefer i really want to visit you. A lot people said that they work hard, but I can demonstrate how i work and how i am punctual in the work. You will see the different in you company. I am interesting the work that your company is doing. I am very interesting to know how your company install the machine of the air condition. Also, I want to learned how you discover new machine with new strategy ""don't worry i will learn fast"".

In conclusion, I think that you should select me because i learn fast and i am very interesting in your company. the most important is that i already tell you how i am and thanks for give a opportunity to write you. I hope you understand me.   ",4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0
2538542762C0,"One topic that is frecuently dabated is if the schools should control students involvement in extracurricular activities. Some people think that the school should take control of the students extra activities and extra time. They feel that students need more educational activities to enrich their knowledgement at school. I believe that students should decided what they want to do with their extra time after school because some students have to work to help their families, some students have to get home earlier to take care of their sibbilings while their parents are at work and students like to do some other activities like sports, art or homework.

First, students have to work to help their parents and sibilings, it could be difficult to work and study at the same time, you get tired and all you think is get home and sleep, students who work do not have time to study for a quiz, test or do homework. However. Study hall could help them finish their homework, students who work don't get involved in extracurricular activities bacause they don't have time to make it through. But also they work for saving money for college, this is an a good idea because you are investing for your future. That is why students who work have to give up with some other acctivities that they want to do.

Second, some students have to get home early to take care of their sibbilings while their parents are at work, most of them can't afford a babysitter, this students might have the time to involve in a club, probably when one of their parents have a day off. They can do homework or other assigments for school or home while they are taking care of their sibbilings like made food for them, clean the house, laundry etc. That can get difficult for them because they have different responsabilities at the same time that they have to take care of school.

Third, other students like to do different activities like sports, they like to exercide everyday after school, there are many sports that hey can practice such as bascketball, baseball, tennis, gymnastics, etc. other students like to do art, envirroment and learn another language they can sign up for any club that they are interested on. This students are deffinetly involve in extracurricular activities from school, but they decided what they want to do with this extra time and the school do not have to tell them what should they do.

As have you read this are my reasons why I believe schools should not take control of the students activities after school. When we get to know each others personal dreams and problems this world is going to change because we are going to understand how people work hard to get succes and happiness.

2567C158F746,"If we are making good choses life can be more fun and easy. for Example if we are making everything correctly life can be more interesting. one way to make life more easy and more fun is to make everything correctly and think first after we want to do something.

Sometime we spend time doing think that can not benifict our future. for Example if I am skiping clases from school the problem will be the my teacher will call my parent and I will get in trable. another reason can be skiping clases will effect my life and my future that can effect my goal. another type of effect can be like if I want to fiend a good job the company where I am working will pay me less. or I can not have the same benefit like other people that graduate from school.

people make thing without think. sometime we make bad choses. for Example in my home country when I was going to school I was making one big bad chose. I was skiping clase with my friend to go play soccer but the problem was that I dont think first. The result was I dont pass the clase my grade where bad and they call my parent and I get in drable. people should think first after they want one to make a chose.

people spend time in think that in the future can effect them. for Example in my opion sometime we make bad chose. another Example my brother when he was in TCW. he was in 9 grade he make a big error he spend more time with his friend and he tallk me the hi dont care about the SOL

but when he was in 12 grade he need to pass the SOL to graduate. he tallk me please dont make the same error the I make.

I belive peoople should think first after making a dicision because if we dont think correctly that can effect or goal or us future. people should think corefully to be success on there life. we can change the world thinking first after we make a decision.",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5

2675A97C2B76,"Do you think being hounst at all times is a good thing? I agree with people who are hounst at all times because they don't lie and lieing can cause a lot of problems. No matter how old you are being hounst is a very good thing for kids, adualts and teenagers. I think you should be hounst at all times because if you'er not hounst people wont trust you, and people can come to you for advice, it also helps people with trust issues to know that there are people out there that you can trust for being hounst.

If you are not hounst people wont trust you. Most people want to be trusted. People want to be trusted in a relationship, friendship and a parentship and most importantly you would want to be trusted in your family. Being hounst whould make people trust in you in many ways. However, you can be trusted be not lieing or makeing fake roumers. For example a girl in our school whould make up roumers and lie about an eight th grader. Therefore, after doing all that no one wanted to be her friend because they could'nt trust her.

If you are hounst at all time people can come to you for advice. If your hounst your friends, sisters, classmates will come to you for advice because they would know you would have great ones. Mostimportantly they would trust you because you'er hounst and they will tell you everything and ask for advice and you will tell them what sounds good and hounst .Therefore, if you hounst you can be trusted by good advice that might actully help that person.

Being hounst also helps people with trust issues to know that there are people out there that you can trust for being hounst. Having trust issues can com from being dishounst and if you'er dishounst with someone it really makes that person think that they can't trust anyone at all. Thats because they have been broke by that other person who keeps lieing. That shows me that being hounst is an amazing thing that everyone chould have.

In summary being hounst is good for everyone .It could be hard for some people but you always have to remember you have to be hounst so, people could trust you, people could come to you for advice, it helps people with trust issues know that there are people out there that you can trust for being hounst.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5
26788FA4ED04,"All schools from United State have a longer summer vacations and that make the students happy but there are some educators feel that summer break is too long and that students don't retain information as easily when they return to school. Summer vacations should don't be change because students want to go to others countries, spend time with their friends and family, and they don't want to be worry about school.

When the students are in summer vacations they planning to go and visit others countries. They want to go to visit their family that live in other country or they only want to go and meet new places. If the educators change the summer vacations to only 3-4 weeks the students will not have much time to visit the places that they want to go. Nevertheless, not all the students want to go to others contries and stay a long time, there some prefer stay in home but they spend the summer time doing what they like to do.

The students like to spend time doing things that they like to do in summer vacations; for example, they want to spend sometime with their family and friends and make memories together. Also they want to work to make money, play video games, play some sports, or go to a summer camp. Meanwhile, others students don't want to go outside because it's so hot or they don't like be under the sun but they also don't want to go to school.

Students like summer vacations because they can make a lots of things that they can't do when they are in school. For example, if they want to go to a party or to a friend's house and can back to their houses until the morning or if they want to look TV all the day they can do it. In addition, they are happy to have a long summer vacation because they are not worry about homewoork or projects, they don't have to get up early to go to school, or study for a test. A long summer break can affect the memory of the students and they can forget somethings that they learn in school; however, some students like to review their notes and it's not so long the summer break. Furthmore, the students don't forget everything that they had learn and take a break of something so difficult and important like school is good.

In conclusion, a long summer break is something good that help the students to relax and come back the next school year with a big smile and ready to learn new things. The students like more a long than a short summer break because they can do more things that they like. The students like summer more than winter because in winter is cold and there not many things to do. Instead, in summer is hot and there are so much things to do. Therefore, the summer vacations should stay the same and don't be change.",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5

Will I think it's a great for kids to art as an elective class because some kids love to draw, others can learn how to draw and even use it in real life situation. So this are the reasons why I think taking art as an elective is a good idea.

Some students will love taking art as an elective because they love to draw. Students will love taking art during school. For example, my friend never had time to work on her art projects after school; therefore, she had a talk with her counselor so she can get put in a art class. Once she got into the art class she had more time to work on her art projects in school. She was also doing something she good at while getting a grade for it.

Students can learn how to draw if they had a art class. Some students want to learn how to draw, but never had a chance to. Therefore, if the school give students a art class they can really learn a lot. Art is not only about drawing; however, some students don't know that. One day, my mom took a art class because she want to learn how to draw. But the art class didn't just teacher her how to draw. She got to learn about the history of art wish is pretty amazing.

Some people think taking art as an elective is not a good idea because students not going to need art once they are done with school. I disagree because some students might wan to be come a artist later on in life. I know a lot of artist who making a lot of money just by drawing. Students who might want to take art can be come famous one day. So taking art class as an elective is a great idea for students.

These are the reason why I think students should have art as an elective class some students love to drawn, some students want to learn, others can even using in life. Art is a great thing so why not enjoy it. ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5
278DE0BFACBF,"School's should not exend a school day by two hours and have a three day weekend. Just to conserve energy and and resources. Students would have to work a lot harder. Student would also have more resonsibility.

Student already hate school and are already really tired when they get home from an seven hour school day. So whyadd another two hours to there day. This would cause a kid alot more stress because of the extra amount of work they would have to do, keeping there grade up and staying fouces on there school work. Plus they would still have to come home and do there homework or any work they didnt finish in class.

Also some student might have a lot more of resonibility to do and adding another two hours would just stress them out with the amount of work. Like what if the kid was doing some after school activites, the kid would be to tired to do any clubs or sports. Students would also be unmotivated to get job because they would have the time or enegry to work.

Some would say that it would a good idea to extend the school days by two hours because of the extra day off they'll get, and because of all the energy and resourcs they'll be saving, but wearing out the kids by giving them extra work to do. Stressing them out moreis not worth it.

So in conclusion I dont think school's should extend there days and give us another day off. It would be to stressful and to tiring. Student need time to go home after school and rest, and have a few days to rest.",3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5
281AB73DF311,"The program is good in many ways such as: helping each other with home work, getting to know each other, and also it is lots of fun.

Home work can be hard on every student no matter the age. It is a lot better to have someone help you rather than being stuck and angry about the fact you don't get the topic. The older students can help the younger ones with their home work. Most likely they would have already learned the topic. Maybe they could even explain it in a better way for that student.

They can all get to know each other. I love meeting older students. I get to ask about what they are learning in school. I could ask about their homework or how their school is like. You could ask them how growing up has changed them. You will be friends and get to know a lot about each other. you may even have a life long friendship in your hands.

My last reason is having fun. I am in a program like this myself at my school. I get to in a classroom with high high school students. They are so much FUN! We play together, learn together, and help each other out. I love it so much and every school across the country should offer an after school program like this.

A program after school where older and younger students hang out is a very good idea. Students can help each other with homework and get to know each other all while having fun. I believe this is a very good program for the good of all students no matter the age or grade. If you are looking for a way to learn and have fun ask someone in charge to offer a program like this at your school.",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.5,3.5

Although some people believe we choose our own character, nevertheless, our character are influences beyond our control because technology influences our traits and famous people can influences our traits and our parents influences our traits by they expectations.

To begin, video game can influenced our traits. For example, my own experience say

3 year ago I start play video game, when I star play with my friends. We always say that when we grow up we like to do what they are doing because their life look good. Also, we start doing the same things as the game like dancing, and thinking same as the game, and acting like them. Our others friends who do not play the game they tell us, that we are change our traits because we are acting like them too. One day we released that game was influenced our character. Clearly, because we star thinking in the future our life same as the game, and that we can do our future as we see in the game easily.

Furthermore, famous people influenced our traits. To continue with my experiences in things that I was influence, for example, when I was 12 year old. one day I was on YouTube, and I star see some videos about bloggers beauty, where they have a lot of makeup I do not use any makeup at the age, but when I see that they do their makeup, and look so beautiful I start doing my makeup, and think because I

was wearing makeup I look good, one they my mom ask me, why I am wear makeup, if I told her that I do not like makeup, I just say because they do their makeup. Then, now that I am 19 year old, I released that I was doing things that I do not like because they are doing. clearly, this prove me that I was influences for a famous beauty.

Finally, our parents influences our traits by they expectations. I will say something our parents want we do what they want. For example, we want to go out we are friends, and we ask our parents if we can go they say not, because they thing that our friend is a bad person. Also, they want to change our thought saying that bad thing about our friends, and finally they change are though about our friends. This show that, our parents can change our expectations about our friends. Clearly, parents always want we do what they want, and we always want they want because we do not them mad with us.

To concluded, our character are influenced beyond our control because video game can influences are traits and famous people can influences our traits, and our parents influences our traits by they expectations. technology influenced our character in form that we that life be like them and people can influence our change in the form the we do thing only, because we see they are doing then older people want to change our though to what they thing. To conclude, our character traits can be influences in different ways that we never expect that can happen. ",3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.5

First, the weather most of the time is hot even in the winter is hot. In the summer sometimes is ,so hot that it can reach the temperature of 100 degrees. Most of the people living in Puerto Rico are use to the hot temperature.

Next, you would see people in the beach's or at the river some people have pool but some people can't buy pools because some don't have money and some people do have money so when the weather is hot you will see most of the people at the beach's or rivers. I personally like going to the river's because the water is colder and is really refreshing when it's really hot.

Next, another reason why I pick Puerto Rico was because of there delicious foods there a lot of tropical dishes there is something call the three meat sandwich witch is made of really tender pork meat,chicken,beef then they put potato sticks and then they add the mayo and ketchup. In the holidays like Christmas puertorican people cook a hole pig and then when the pig is done cooking they cut the pig and shred it into pieces and then they eat it with rice mix with beans.

Finally, most of my family is from Puerto Rico so most of my family know's the best places to go and the type of food that we would like. Most of are family makes a party when we come from the U.S because we only go and visit in the summer because of school we can't visit when ever we want to. When ever I visit Puerto Rico I have to see my two little brothers and my friend that I have not seen sense last summer most of the time I go to my consents house because we always play baseball or basketball ,but when it's to hot we stay home watching T.V or playing PlayStation we play with my friend that lives in Virginia.

I personally disagree with this statement because, many times i have been told that i have a bad first impression the first time people see me, many people say i look mean and with a bad attitude. However, i do not have an attitude when people are friendly or speak me.

New research says that it is far easier to loose a good reputation, then to gain one. Which is true, but you would never know how is the other person until you speak to them. You cannot judge a person by the way they look, speak or drees. For example, couple of years back on my first day of school, in the United States, people would judge me because, they thought i knew English, and when they would speak to me, i would put my head down and not say anything, months later i learned english and knew how to have a conversation with them; Not long a long, i had a person come to me and say; I did not thnk you spoke english, because i remember back in 6th grade, you would not talk. He changed the way he thought of me when i started having a conversatiomn with him. Perphas, You can always change you first impression.

First impressions are clearly not the best ones, but we can always make a choice on wheather change them or not. I have experienced many first impressions.

2CD73298526F,"The use of technology has had a negative effect on people's lives, because they tempt to take the use of technology as a fundumental part of their life. They get so attached that they miss beautiful moments, people or opportunities, life is full of extraordinary places and people to share life with but why make all that dissapear just to be on a phone or any other technological device.

Technology can be consider a threat for families. Why would it be consider a threat? Well, let's say you and your family are going to Generic_City, you go to the best hotel an as soon as you get there your wife, your children or even you go on their phones immediately without wanting to do or go anywhere. There could also be another example with that, a family reserves a table on the best expensive restaurant in Generic_City and as soon as the family sits down they all go on their phones, even the parents gave that example instead of them wanting to have a nice family dinner. Families lose the connection due to cell phones because just like that family had a date with their phones and not with their own family the connection starts to decrease and after all that it'll be hard to have that open conncetion with your family. That's consider a threat because you're letting the use of technology define how your family will be or do things in there lives. It could also be a positive effect because and not all families struggle with the addiction to technology, people such as; doctors, judges, lawyers, businessman, etc... They have a job and the best way to keep in contact with people that need of them, they have to always be using their cell phones or computers to be in touch with them no matter where or what they are doing. But that shouldn't be any excuse not to have a family time, family comes over everything, you can't miss moments with your family or else you'll regret it in the future you'll just remember being on the phone that entire time. Don't let technology control you or your family.

Love could also vanish do to the lack of commitment with your phone. Relationships now a days are very different from back then, they don't get to be more romantic well they could but maybe through texting. The love they had for each other could easily be broken do to social media, either the guy or the girl could possibly find someone else and cheating happenes, I know that does not the whole reason why but it does affect you in a way. Let's talk about Khloe Kardashian, she being a famous women had to receive the bad news of her baby dad cheating on her moments before she gave birth. In some cases couples don't get to enjoy their date because one of them is in there phone. I've seen that breaking up through text is the biggest excuse for a men or woman, if social media didn't work like it does now there woulndn't be a lot of cheatings. Social media could also be used for good, if you are in a long distance relationship you have the opportunity to talk to your significant other across the world and also because you get to know someone you might marry in the future. But is still bad, social media causes a lot of things to happen such as suicide or having eating disorders or even bulling.

Technology has a negative effect on most kids in elementary, middle or high school. Back then you woulnd't see little kids having the latest phone, because the new generation that is coming is more open minded about how ""society"" works. There might be things I don't even know and yet you ask a seven year old kid and they know it already, Society has changed a lot from when I was a little girl to how kids are now. KIds are mostly connected on their phone most of them just want to stay home and play Fortnite, not only kids play that all grown ups which makes them looks so childish in my opinion, while before they would really want to go outside to play any sports they could. Little kids having phones at there early age makes them have bad grades in school because there main focus is texting, videos, or video games which don't take them anywhere. The percentage of students having good grades has decreease in a way that surprises you. how many times you see little babies asking for their paretns phone and what do parents do, they give them there phone because they can't control their children what will make them obey is technology. In some way it could be good because they get the chance to have more opportunities in school wise, like having computers in our home helps get your grade up if you use it wisely, some parents don't have the money to buy their kid a computer while schools does provide some don't take a good opportunity. Just look at how children are attached to there phones. Focusing in school will give you so much opportunities that will take you on a greater point in your life and I feel like that is what we need to make all of them understand.

In conclusion, Is good to have technology but don't use it to hurt people which will take them to commit suicide or having eating disorders. Cherish every moment you get to have with your loved ones don't let technology control who you are or who you can be. People don't have the same human contact anymore because they are more worried that they'll get a text that they need to respond as soon as possible.

2E98035B8362,"American jazz legend Duke Ellington said, ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best. ""

I agree, because when a problem is present you have a chance to learn a lesson, new things and methods to solve it.

When a problem is present you have an opportunity to learn a lesson and keep trying to solve the problem until you find the answer to it.

When you have a problem you can also learn new things like what is it that is making the problem, what it is affecting, and whom is it affecting.

When you have a certain problem you can also learn other methods to solve it like how and who made the problem, how can you solve the problem, and what plan you can use to solve it.

For example you are facing a bigger problem that you have ever faced before and when you finale solve it you have learned a new lesson, method, and two or more new thing about how you can,may or will solve your future problems even if they are tougher than the ones you ever faced before because the bigger you get, the bigger your problems become.

For another example, imagine yourself as a detective in a homicide case, you are facing the problem of learning new evidence and using new methods, while using the lessons and new thing you have learned while were investigating the crime scene. You have to use all of those tactics to find the corporate, because all you need is to use the lessons you have learned while you are learning a new one, learning two or more new things, and having a method to capture the corporate (criminal).

2EEEE9C5E227,"Are first impressions impossible to be changed? It has been said that they are almost impossible to change. Most people tend to agree with this statement, but what if they are wrong? I personally disagree and believe that there are ways to make impressions change. It's all about giving the person the opportunity to show and see who they really are.

First impressions are judgments we made before getting to know the individual. These impressions can be on favor or against the person being judge. Thinking on ways to make these impressions change, I have found some good ways and these can be; getting close to the person, asking to their close friends about them, asking teachers or other adults. All this based on my life term experiences.

Getting close to the person meaning; talking to them personally, this could make a big change on the impression been transmitted the first time you saw the person. By talking to the person you will find so much things and probably things of your interest. When talking to a person you are making judgments in your head, but your mind always changes from what you thought this person was before.

Asking to their close friends about them is a risky but also a good idea. Their friends know them better and can provide a good opinion on them. When asking their friends, you should make a comparation on all of their opinions, this would help to know this person's circle. Social circles are very important and most of the time define a person's being. Knowing this person's circle will change that first impression on their social side.

Asking teachers or simply community adults will help a lot to change that first impression. Maturity level is something we always judge when comes to impressions. Teachers will tell you what is this person attitude at school. Community adults will tell you how does this person behaves on their everyday living. Whether you find it positive or negative, opinions definitely make the first impression change.

People say that first impression only last a very short moment, therefore it can't be change because it's just flash judgment on a person. On the other hand we have people like me that believe that as long as you have not contact with that person's circle, you are still in the first impression and it can be change. Getting to know an individual, Talking to their friends, and others adults' opinions are all first impression changers.

Overall first impressions are possible to be change and we need put these steps on play. If we would to follow these steps we would not be hating on each others and will live in a better world.",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5
2F3210D23414,"Students now can take classes from their houses. Schools are offering students the possibility to take classes online from their houses, I think is a excellent idea because sometimes students dont have the possibility on getting a ride to get to school, or it makes it easier for students that have to stay home for personal reasons, or even if you want to take a class during the summer to get more credits and get to graduate earlier.

Sometimes students do not have the possibility on getting rides to school and the county do not offer them a bus transportation system that can take them to school, for example in my country Costa Rica there is not a free transportation system to get to school and the only transportation system is the public one and you will have to pay for it, its an excellent idea from the schools to have this kind of classes that you can take from your own house.

Some students have reasons that make them stay home, such as girls being pregnant, students taking care of their parents that need people to take care of them because they are sick or have any disability and they can not stay home alone, in those cases students can finish their school courses at home and take care of their loved ones at the same time.

Some students just do it to finish high school earlier, they have the opportunity on taking classes online during the summer and be able to get less classes on their senior year or just graduate earlier if they taking the standard diploma, that is a smart thing to do if you are planing on go to college and finish your carrier on a young age, and start working at young age too.

On my opinion I think that having that opportunity is a good thing and a bad thing because going to school is the best decision that you can make on your life, you get to make friends and get to know a lot of people during all the time you spend at school, but not everyone have that opportunity, thats why this opportunity that the school is giving you is unique and can help you a lot, the only thing you need is a computer or a electronic device that can get access to the internet.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0

Cell phones can be used in many things math class it can help students in their time of need.

In history class cell phones can benefit you if you use it right. Incase the teacher wants you to go on a cite to see which year was it that brought us here and get the answer. If theres a time when a student is about to leave early they can ask their teacher to let them to take picture of the board so the student can write down on their notebook. The teacher can also bring in a fun activate thats related to their class and the students phone so they can play kahoot.

In conclusion cell phones should be used for educational purpose so the students can be more active when they are on their phones. If the teacher allows the students to use their cell phones it can bring a lot of interactions with the students. The students can education can be improved because of the use cell phones. The use of cell phones can make school a little bit more fun. The students will be excited when it comes to usuing their phones kahoot will be great the students use it.

2FE31DD4FD98,"Personalty, I disagree that my school should follow the model by extending the school day with two hours. The school would have more disadvantages that benefits. My point of view this issue is that school decision might affect students schedule, students health and the school will create a unneeded investment that can create also a problem on parents income.

My first opinion concerning the fact why my school should not follow this model, it is the reason that would create pressure on students schedule. Most of the schools have sports teem or music band. Some teenager are included in a teem or a bad, they would need time after school to practice their passion. Taking away that time by adding two extra hours, the students will be under the pressure and will have to choose the school instead of the activities that they love. The two extra hours might create a disorientation for students schedule and students mind .

The role of students is to learn and be prepared for the future, to put pressure on a young person will give a wrong perspective of the life. Even if in the future some students would possibly have a career that include a four-days work, the school should not be like a job. Cutting one day of a student schedule would create more homework and they would be suppose to learn by themselves. If the students would be tied or they will need to do other activities, most of the student would rather prefer to stay home than go to school.

For example, in Romania, the Music schools had Friday off and two hours added for the rest of school days. For most of the students was a hard period. Being at an artistic school has already harder, students played four instruments and they tried to keep their grades up. Most of the students decided leave the school after the decision of expanding the school day was approved. However after three month the school went back to normal schedule, but the school lost a lot of students.

The second reason that I support my opinions have reference to students health. Spending a long time in the same place, students might cause eating disorder, physical and psychical pain. For a young student that have homework or other activities, would be harder to have a clear mind everyday at school. Sitting almost all day it might develops back problems and others problems.

Spend more than seven hours at school students might create a sensible body. However, a young human being should not have problems with their body.

Eating disorder can be a really big problem for students, in this days most of the young people prefers unhealthy food. At schools many of the young scholars are picky, they would prefer to skip lunch or just eat snacks and other unhealthy food. The lunch is the important meal of the day, and it happened to be at school. Students will need to eat better and the school will need to add more time at lunch .

My last reason why I degree with extending the school day it is the fact that school create unneeded investment and the parents budget will have to suffer. Even if the school have the purpose to conserve the energy and resources, adding the extra hours would be the same as a normal five days of school. The school would not conserve the energy, in fact would create a uncomfortable situation for students. School would need to invest more in a healthier food for give the protein that a young student need.

For the students that dont have a free lunch or reduced price for lunch, the parents or the guardian of the teenager will be force to pay more for their children to eat at cafeteria, and also the parents will add some extra snack or food.

With all my reasons , my opinion is that my school or other shouldn't follow this model and extending the school hours. Some people said that is a good idea to create the opportunity of a free day ,that help students to spend more time with family. However I think the school should give the opportunity for students to feel comfortable and not to be under the pressure of the time. ",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0

Sometimes the people can think a person who saw for the firsrt time and saw he or she needed help and the person didn't help is because the person did't want to help but is because the person is no extrovertive and think is no a good idea to ask.

Sometimes a person says ""Hi"" with a good tone to a person who saw for the for the first time and the person respons with no a good tone and the happens the same thing with other person, then the person no is kind like before, and when see other person doubt if say ""Hi"" with a good tone, and when they are meeting each other the other person relize the person was so kind before.

Yes, The positive attitude is key for life. for example, if people are happy the negative things are running away from them. And also, if you are with good attitude, good things are beside you; it's feel like god is blessing you. In addition positives attitudes are good to live good and peacefully on every single places there are going to be people that they're not going to thinks as you, they just want to hurt you but, that people that are angry all the time is not their fault is just because around of them just negative things are happening. So, thats why good attitudes are good not just for you, and is good for the people around you too because you don't hurt them. And you can get a better job to support your self and support your family, never let them alone.

3498E7E2DAB6,"In the principals office there is quote stating that "" your life can be beneficial if your doing something very productive, because it can lead you to great success in life"" In some way we ask ourselves if we are do something with our lives and be thinking ahead on what we want to do with our life and what can take us to success. Is that true?. Its more than just having something to do. Life is very short, As long as you are doing something with success. Living is an option as well as just giving up and not trying very enough. Accomplishing something in life to any dream you want to have. If you dont try as hard in life, you will never succeed and imagine all those who gave up and thinking... Where they are now?. Living life can only be chosen just by you and it's only your choice to think in what direction you want to take. Although some may believe that life,belief, and hope prove that doing something with your own future can accomplish and lead you to a successful life.

Your life can be turned around very quick, if only you are doing something very little that makes you happy and know that sticking with it, can take you anywhere you want in your future just only by trying and not giving up on your own self. Not trying and thinking way ahead of your own future can bring yourself down which can lead you to depression, low self of esteem , and as well of not having very much hope. In human society it has been discovered that in most of our population much as 40% of our people in the U.S are unemployed and don't have anything to do which leads them to go down in their life. There is so much poverty going on in this world and just by thinking about it and you think to yourself and say what did they do wrong in life that brought them to were they are now?. Your future can be so easy as long as you try and have hope in your own self. Just by knowing that you have accomplished anything in life can lead your own way to success. Your future can only be held in your hand no one else. Like its said once life can only chosen due too live a long term of time or short period of time its all held under your back, your shoulders, and your own self future. Being successful life is very important to your life having many accomplishment can make your self feel very motivated and make it very good. You can make your life very easy and not to hard just as long your are doing something that makes you happy and also as long what right direction you are taking and what good path is in your way. Life isnt easy either, it can be very difficult just as long as your trying at your very best and your pushing yourself into having great success, you will be at your very best and the top est you can be. The choice you make, can make it very effectively on you and it can change anything.

The make key in life is as well having much belief on your own future or in life.

Belief can only be happened by you and no one else, It can be very good and at its best just as long your try and making your life not to difficult. Having belief isnt bad at all its just a feeling you have on yourself and that the feeling makes it good for just for yourself and no one other. Every person in the world is very different in their way, everyone isnt the same in the way you see or in the perspective you think in. In society each person can think any type of way they want and they only problem is that you should be only be worrying about yourself but no other. There has been many issues due too how you believe and what others think about you and get to worried about it. Our world shouldnt be like that, in our belief we should stay positive in each one of us and stay motivated in any situation you go through. The belief in come in any one and whoever think in the mindset of way, we can all go through difficult times and not have any belief in ourselves. But only yourself can change no other can do that for you. The accomplishment in life can mean allot in yourself and can also have no good beneficial idea just for you, but something you can also do is give a big impact in human society.

In setting a good state of mindset can change you very completely, another word to help yourself could also be hope. Having hope could lead you very far in life and also having great accomplishments that can also lead you to a big success. If you cant see it but others can see how your life is being impacted on you not doing something with your life. Only you can change that, but as others can't. Another key to life is hope. It can take you very far and also lead you in any direction yourself takes or as well in any path you want. Having hope is an option and a belief you want or can have. Not every person has hope or believes in themselves because all they want too do is fail. Others can see you fail and not try, but it is very hard for you to see yourself. In life if you have it can lead too do good things in life and have great accomplishments that no other has, just by having good hope. Just know to yourself that having hope can lead yourself to great victory and a great life that no other can have but you.

In those who dont believe that if are doing something isnt an accomplishment to success, which that takes my position in saying that themselves thinking that is wrong. Because a key to success in life is having many accomplishments and lead you very far. But in those who also say that being inactive is a way too success is also wrong on their point of view and isn't a true fact statement. Inactivity cant take you too far in life and isnt a beneficial success to life. Having anything to do that you enjoy can lead too good accomplishments and also great success.

Having a great life,hope, and belief can take you very far and lead you to any direction or path you want to take. Any one can have a great life just as long as you try. Life is easier as long you make it a success.           ",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.0,3.0
34D76C62269C,"If you still attended school, how would it feel to go to school the whole year? Just have off 3-4 weeks of summer break, maybe 2 weeks of winter break and 1 week in fall and spring break.

Well I can imagine that and just imagining that makes my head hurt.

Just having to come for 8-9 months of school is hard for some students and I would think that less number of students would come to school if we had a year-round school. Just having a normal school year(8-9 months)is amazing. Although some people say that having a year-round school is a amazing idea because that way students would not forget what they had learned over the year, actually having a year-round school is not a great idea because students would have less stress about school and also students would try harder when they come back from summer break.

Although some people say that having a year-round school is an amazing idea because that way students would not forget what they had learned over the year.

Also because students would come back after 3-4 weeks and still remember.

Having a year-round school would give students more time to learn all the material they have to know and more easy and faster. also have more opportunity to get better grades because you are more time in school. I read in a article that it said that the more time you spend in school and focus the better it is for you in the future. Having a year-round school has advantages and disadvantages such as being more time in school,less time being out of school, maybe less school activities, less summer time , etc.

Many things can change when the school changes. is always better to keep the old way than start a new way and not be successful.

I think that not having a year-round school is a good idea because students would have less stress about school.

Students wont be as stress because of school the whole year and only a little bit of vacation. Stress can be something bad not just for students but for everyone. Stress causes illness such as your head hurts,back hurts, feel like not doing anything, etc. Not having a system of school like that can give students more time for vacation alone or with the family. Having a 3-4 moths of summer vacation is enough for you to have a really nice vacation with family or like I said before alone. school causes a lot stress for students and having to come all year is more stressful. enjoying your summer is not just about one week or two is about having time for yourself and family.

also not having a year-round school would make students try more for the next year that they come back to school.

When students have more time off school it makes them want to come back. Students want to come back and start the year. Some of them get so tired of being at home that they just want to come back. Also being on regular school break students enjoy more the summer than just 1 month or less. They have more opportunity to go explore the world and everything. Much more freedom for the summer. When is summer students cant wait to leave school but when its like 2 months out of school they want to come back. Summer is the best season for a student because is when they enjoy most of there time with the family,friends and having fun in the summer is the best memories and maybe the best memories they have with friends and family. My best memories are the ones in summer that I enjoy mostly with my family.

In conclusion, some people say that having a year-round school is great because that way students wont forget what they had learned over the year but I think that having a year-around is not a good idea because students would feel more fatigue than the usual and also when they come back to school they would feel more comfortable and ready to learn more again.

Being out of school is a great thing but when you are almost done with summer you just want to go back to school and see your friends and than is the same thing when you are going to summer you feel so excited that you just want to be done and not come back but is the same feeling when you are coming back from summer to start the year. Having pretty experiences and sharing time with the family is amazing that is what makes summer amazing. wouldnt you want to have your children with you in summer vacation? ",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.5
3564BBEC4A09,"Should be there a difference between people who wants to find more accomplish or inactive!

There is a debate between people who thinks should people more accomplish then inactive. Some people believes their journal will take them to their destiny and they doesn't have to accomplish any thing. It doesn't matter for some people to make decisions and others think different. Because they think their destiny will take them to where they should be. In other hands, I believe what Thomas Jefferson said, ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" This quote shows me why we have to make our decision so fast and not let to wait. Because we don't know what will happen in the future. We have to being more active, so it will help the country economy. When we are active the country rules and powers can change. Being active is optimal for immigrants too because it help them to learn new language. People always have to take life seriously because how they will know there will be a tomorrow. We should try to make decision before our destiny makes one for us.

First,

when people are more active by working hard it help the economy of a country. Many people accomplish succeed by working hard in difficult environment and it is beneficial for a country to have some excellent active workers. By accomplishing more succeed in your job they can rise your salary. In other jobs they always honor those who are working so hard. It's less chance to be loser. To find sussed everything basically inside your hand. When people accomplish more is not just for their beneficial it is for their country too.

Second, In the past women didn't have any rights in to the government until ninetieth amendments. Before women were inactive and that leave them behind, but after while they start having job in the government branch by protecting their rights. When women start being active it help them to accomplish more success. In America women are having more rights than any other country because they were fight for their freedom. In my own country which is Generic_City, women are afraid of men because women are not active and they never try to having voice in public. Still today men are making decisions for the women and treat them like a slave person, Some female from my country try to being active to make a differences in my country.

Third, some of immigrants try to be an active in their life by moving into another country. For immigrants it doesn't matter to accomplish more or not they just want a basic life. When my mom made the decision to move to the United State I was afraid to learn English and my mom use to tell me you can do it if you really wants to learn. When I first start school in U.S I was so nervous about how can I introduce my self to the teacher because I wasn't able to say hello even in English, but I trust my mom and everything changed. Finally, I get the success and that makes me really happy.

In conclusion, we all will find the success by working hard and not let anything make feel us failure. By accomplish more you will be succeed just don't lose your self. Be hard work and an active person is better than acting like loser. When people inactive they always behind of others and their life is meaning less. People should always accomplish more because there should be a line between who wants win and who wants lose. However, many people can't handle success because they lose their self to quickly.",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0
35A7E263AC71,"the prompt says ""Unless you try something beyond what you have mastered you will never grow"". one would say that is something very wise to say .But due to the lack of wisdom around the world it is basically useless to say anything wise. I personally agree apart from physically growing I'm almost done. Going back to the topic I do agree with what author Ralph Waldo Emerson said in his quote, That if you don't try something beyond on what i have mastered am I really growing in any way ?

I have try anything new and just do the same routine over and over i'm not going to make far in life .Although I can't think of a reason why someone would disagree the statement. I have tried many thing my seventeen years of being alive, and I can say I have grown to be the person I am now .Many people don't try new thing only because they are quick to judge on the presentation of the new item or new person , but if people actually gave the new experience a chance it could be life changing for better or worse .

So going back to you trying something beyond what i mastered I won't grow or something like that it's all in perspective if I wish to try something new and be a better person in society I will but if I wish to not try anything at all and just to the same boring routine day after day .Sooner or later I will get bored of everything .Even though some may argue by saying ""that's how I got successful in the first place by doing the same routine over and over"". In some cases that may work for example in sports the athlete must do the same thing over and over until the get better at the sport or like a dance they practice the same dance over and over until it;s ready to be shared with the world how well one can dance . And for others trying a new routine can lead them to success (well maybe not everyone is talented)

In conclusion trying something new does change who you are in a bit by either helping or destroying yourself .People do grow to be wise and old and other don't grow old wise just young and reckless. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson was a wise man to say ""Unless you try something beyond what you already have mastered you will never grow.

How can this club help students?

You can get help with subjects like math,science,and reading. Do you need help with any subject from school?

Reasons why I would volunteer for this club. I don't mind helping students out with work but if its bad kids then I am not helping them,I do not want to be treated like trash. It wont affect my agenda because most of the time I am just staying home playing video games so I don't mind helping out,I will finally have something better to do.

37193A72B5D2,"Teachers and some adults think that some students are expected and have the capacity to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Student are the only ones who can decide If they are able to take care of that responsibility or not.

In my opinion I think different and I don't think that young students are able to carry out with a career and a will support my reasons. First of all I think about all of that students who are already independent by their self, they probably have a job and need to pay their own bills, the rent, their phone, and they maybe have no time to carry out with all of that responsibilities with their education and the career at the same time, they need to work hard study and that is not easy for them. As the same time they probably have a lot of homework to do and they need to be responsible at their job. Another good reason I have is that some students without time they have no help, and they have no support from other people to try and see if they are able or they are already capacity to care about the career in high school, many students are able to do it but some of them are not able to pay for the help or the stuff need for the classes, some students have the luck to find people who just want to help them, and give them the opportunities to go on and help them with the decision they take to carry out with the career in high school but teacher or other people just don't want to help them just because they think and the give their opinion that they are not ready to take that decision and they still learning and have not the capacity to work on it and they just leave them and the don't give the students the opportunity to explain or show them that they are able to do it. Also a lot of students are fighting and giving all of they can with their education and they are giving up, they get tired with all the classes they have with all the responsibilities they are carry on and that why is hard for them keep studding in high school but must of the student are strong and still working to getting prepare even if they are having problems at their house or problems with their family they just wanna move on. Even though that some of students are too young in high school and they are still learning about how life is, how hard is to take care about the responsibilities the adults are already taking on and they think how hard can be if they take the decision to identify a career by the time they enter in high school it can be difficult to them because with the rest of the courses the are taking they will take more then normal classes. For some reason the students are not even thinking about their career when they are just enter the high school they are probably focus in the responsibilities they are going to have or they are already have in high school with their education, they have to take care of them. A lot of student make a mistakes, for example when they doesn't care about their education and they focus on being the best in their personality how many friends can they have or how good can they look, they need to ripen on their attitude and star thinking about their education they need to think how good in their education can be better on or how good grades can they have to make their family proud or how far can they go if the keep working hard and make proud of their self.

People can think that it would be easy for them or some of they can think that it will not. I think that it is not a good idea selected to guide them toward a specific career, thats why I just explain my reasons so they can see that it will be difficult, hard and stressful, they are too young and they can't take care of a big responsibility.",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5

Every country, every school, every teachers have teaching for students how to working together to playing games on assignment. And games can make for students likely work together to create atmosphere funny, if they working with a atmosphere new, they could be give some ideas faster and learning better. Why we need to teaching them the way like that? If we did not teaching the students working with a group, what happen will be?

Almost the students really like working alone than working with a group. Because they think they can give some idea bad, and they don't want somebody complain when they do something wrong. If parents or teachers don't teaching them working with a group and believe by them self, they will never successful on the way they are.

Five years later, Bill Gate become rich people in the world. If Bill Gate did not told friends working with him, than we never know about software and computer like him created that. Bill Gate said: If the war appears, you did not working together, your country will be lost.

Why we necessary to working with a group? Because working with a group might be make your love each other and understand when you work. When a group understand each other, they would be do some project better and always will be on time. Like a company they never have one people working in there, because one people could not be do some project better a group. Every people working in company, they never working with alone, because they don't know where you fail when you writing essay. That's why we need a group can fix your fail and make you do better in your job. When you working with a group, you can learning some ideas your friends talking and the way they working.

Like playing games, they need a team working together, if one people in a team like working alone, they can make your team loser. If you like working with a group, you will be have more friends and second language if your friends from another country. If in the world, we don't working together, maybe the world war three will be occur and the peaceful never got in the world. And we will never know culture of another country.

In general, working a group can make students learning about how to work together and give an ideas best. And can be understand more about the life with people in group, can share problem and working better. If you teaching for your son or daughter working together, when they grow up, they can brainstorm better and faster.

39492CE9549E,"Teachers can justify students knowledge more accurately than students. Teachers are very experienced compare to the students because they gained so much knowledge in their life. By doing the teacher designed projects, students can learn something that they did not know about. Teachers would know what topics they really need to focus on and what are the most important things they need to know about. Students summer projects should be designed by their teachers to make sure that they are being effective, hardworking and responsible for their work during the break.

Summer projects of the students should be designed by their teachers to make sure that the students are being effective during the summer break. Teachers know the academic ability of their student because they know how the students answers some specific types of questions, they know how the students think and understand. For Example, In my fifth grade there was a math teacher named Generic_Name. Ms. Generic_Name and I spent so much time with each other to discuss my mistakes on a test, She asked me do to test corrections on a paper. I solved all the questions correctly without a time limit, She came to me and said, ""I knew you could do it, because I have seen you working very hard these days"". Then, I realized that I knew how to solve these problems but I was scared to complete the test before the timer goes off because I did not know I could complete everything. This examples describes that the teachers know our academic ups and downs than ourselves. They also know what we need to learn to succeed in our class, So when they design a project to their students they make sure that the students are going to be effective on their break and learning something new which will help them in their future.

Summer projects of the students should be teacher-designed to make sure that the students are hardworking even during the summer break. Teachers know the capacity of hard work we do in our class, they observe the amount of effort that we put into different things like talking, reading, writing and singing, etc. For example, one of my teacher in 10th grade was really nice to me, she always used to ask me about my hobbies and interests. I had a presentation in her class and I went to ask her for help the day before the presentation because I was preparing for almost a month, I wanted to ask her if I did any mistakes in the slides. After I showed her my slides, she gave me a big hug an said ""I know how hard you worked for this presentation, I gave you a hard project to see is you are capable to do it or not. Even though you came to United States two months ago, you did a fantastic job"". I was very happy to hear her saying that I did good and on the day of my presentation I felt really confident on my work. This example explains how the teacher knew that I worked so hard to do my best. By assigning me a hard project based on my level of understanding, I worked hard to understand and analyze every single detail. That helped me to gain confidence on my self and my level of hard work improved a lot. When teachers design the project they make sure that the students are trying to work hard and they want to see how your working level is improving.

Summer projects of the students should be designed by their teachers to make sure that the students are being responsible for their work during the summer break. when teachers design the project they know how long it is going to take the students to complete the project and how well focused and responsible a student need to be while doing this project. For example, My history teacher in 10 grade was very strict, she always wanted our whole class to turn in everything that she posted online in one day. After 2-3 months of struggling in her class, everything was going really good till the last day of that academic year. All of my work was completed on time. This example says that even though I worked really hard in the beginning, when it came to the end of the year I was really happy for being responsible for my own work. By learning how to be responsible from that teacher, helped me a lot in all of my other classes too. Summer projects given by our teachers can make us feel responsible for ourselves, by doing the projects teach us how to be focused and concentrated to get them done on time. when the students design the project they take it easy because most of the students just pick something they already know or they already feel confident on, which will not make them feel responsible.

Teachers are very experienced to know how students think about something, they can understand what students know and what we do not know academically. They always try to teach us how to build our academic skills. They want the students to be in an amazing position, they always want to see the best from us because they know how the student are. Summer projects of the students should be teacher designed to make sure that they are being effective, hardworking and responsible for their work during the break. ",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5
39524C93F4D4,"People will tell you that without doing something, you'll never get what you want. I agree. Accomplishing something is a great feeling when you know you've done it because when you know you put in the time and effort for it and get a great result. It shows that the time you toke to make it was worth it. Sitting around, letting people hand you stuff will get you no where in life, because instead of you doing something, you wait for them to give it to you, not aware of what that person had to do to.

What does it mean to accomplish something? To me accomplishing something is when you worked hard for what you did and you're satisfied with your result. That to me is accomplishing something. Whenever I set my mind to anything, I do whatever it takes to make it. For example, I had a championship finals in a week and I needed time to prepare my mind and body for the game. The time came to play the game and all I could think about was winning that trophy. We ended up winning, and I won what I was waiting to accomplish. I don't think I could have made it if I didn't make an dedicate my time to win the finals.

Kids nowadays are spoiled by there parents to get whatever they want just by asking. I can understand that some parents care about what the needs of there own children, but I often see parents buy usless things for there kids and that can be a problem because when they know they can get these things that aren't any use for them,

they go asking for other stuff that they don't need. A solution to this problem can be when they are old enough to get a job, to get one so they can make money, so they can buy things for them selves. Instead of leaching on Mommy and Daddy's money all the time. Getting a job shows that you're doing something to get what you want, for example, a house, a car, anything you can spend you're own money that you need. The effort you showed got to where you are and now you know you accomplished it.

A person I know that has accomplished alot in his life is Cristiano Ronaldo. He is a soccer athlete and was born in a small town in Portugal. Like others there, his family was really poor and couldn't afford him anything really. He was a trouble child in school and misbehaved when things didn't go his way. He was very talented in soccer though. He would go outside, find anything round and did whatever he would do to a real soccer ball. He was noticed by coaches when they would here a young kid scoring goals not any normal kid would. He moved to the capital of Portugal and would play for the towns Division one team. He never forgot his family back home. He would have made a ton of money to send back to his family and bought them a house in a much nicer and safer location. His goal was to be the best player in all of soccer. He worked in and out of practices to get better and play for a club that people would notice that he was. He was bought by one of the greatest teams in all of europe Real Madrid. He was the most highest paid athlete at the time and whenever he got his pay check, he would always use it for a good cause like, family, charity, etc. He would eventually be nominated for the best player award five times and would end up winning those times. He accomplished what he had dreamt of becoming, and I hope people could see his story and realize you can't just sit around and do nothing, you have to put in time and effort to get what you want.

I can understand when people can get lazy and not do anything to accomplish anything. Not everyone is perfect. But sooner or later they'll realize that without doing something, you can't get what you want. Sometimes people are fortunate to recieve things just by asking, but do you want to live a life leaching off people? Letting them know ""oh this person can't live without me because I get him everything"" I know I wouldn't. I hope to accomplish here that, you have to make an effort in order to accomplish something.

So, i think if students go to after school club to finish there homework, etc then the students won't have to worry about it at home and keep there grades in good shape. Also to keep it simple it's important to have something important like this (after school club) to let the students know they have after school to help them complete there homework.

And then, if students need help on completing there homework, etc then the students can come to after school to get the help they need. And create a bond with other students by helping each other.

The military are always looking for people who want to join the force this three years will make it easy for them to employ some of the students in the army, air force,navy e. c.t. Some people are old to be in high school if you are 20years old and still in high school if they tell you that is four years instead of three years you will be kick out if that school and that is not a good thing. There are lot of ways that graduating younger better than graduating old you can finish school by the age of 18 and then still be learning but not in high school. if you beside to go to collage and finish your fours diploma or more you can that high school fours can be a disaster for the students.

The three years program is helping the student to finish school early and making him/her responsible in life be ready for life early by going to collage and spending the rest of the year that they should have be in high school in collage or other work places. there are a lot of ways that you can get in jobs great jobs and stuff all because you are young. Some work places need young people to work for them if you not young or if you are that old they will not take you in that job or that work place. for example i was trying to apply for a job in the internet i went through all the documents but what i so was you can't applied this job if you don't have a high school diploma think about if you were homeless and you need a job as soon as possible and they came and said that you can't have this job if you don't have high school diploma you,and you need that job but you still have fours to finish that is not a good helping point.

This program will help the student a lot in saving time in his or her life time and finish school in a young age that is a big advantage for the student to have more stuffs to think about in life and just being in high school . This program is gonna save you a year of high school .If i have the right to this program i will make sure i do all the necessary was that i should do to finish school i year before my actual year. That will make me finish school in a young age and start looking for a job or go to collage. It depends what you want to do when you finish but it is a great idea and a great program to join to it saves time ,it can enable you to quality for jobs that required jobs that consider age. If it was me i can spend all summer without having a fun with my friends and go to the program do all work just to graduate early is just for a summer . Other one is that staying after school and i don't see any difficulties in doing that .it will save you time and even money because some school is not for free you have to pay to be in that school and other said stuff to pay too. All that will be limited for just pay three years instead of four years. it saves money and saves time. Programs like this have to be stand and be form as a big low that every school should do. It will even help some of the parents because not all students ride the school buses some of them they are brought to school by there parents a pick them again after school is not easy and some parents are working they can't always do that if the three years stands it will benefit the parents too by the way .The contain of my paper is minimize the years in high school. it also helps in man y ways like saving time, saving money , i can even say saying gas too because some parents take there children to school very day so if this policy stands legal and all the schools in the area are doing it they gonna make things easy for both the students and parents .",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
3C56844D4CF0,"Many students become involved in extracurricular activities enrich their educational experiences, and some even become involved in so many activities that they have little time to or complete homework assignments. In my opinion it would be better if the school has controls in the students involvement in extracurricular activities. Therefore, school offer the capacity that students have to develop their potential. Secondly, school count by with the necessary tools that students needed. Thirdly, school helped the students a level physical with the sports. If the school simplify by pushing the controls and the extracurricular activities for the students, their are more productive at school and teaching-learning process undoubtedly be win-win for all the participants involved in this activities.

The first reason that support the school has a controls in the students involvement in extracurricular activities, is school offer the capacity that students have to develop their potential some students to take advantage of the opportunities, while that some students their classes seems boring. For example, I don't have any idea that the biology class was a interesting class, because I was observing the animals, plants, bacteria, and human body, biology is a wonderful class in this class I learn the importance that have the activities in the school. Therefore, everything was I learn because the schools offer to me the capacity to develop me potential.

The second reason the school has a controls in the students involvement in extracurricular activities. If school count with the necessary tools that students needed, research has shown that teenagers experience with the school has a control with the students. For example, the school count with the books, computers, and different classes, and with everything that a students needed to their life , this statement helped to students go to different schools. Some instruments has the ability to change the students attitude and impact everyone and should be strongly considered.

The last reason to support the school has a control in the students involvement in extracurricular activities, is school helped the students a level physical with the sports. Some schools helped the students to have the best level the sports and to make the dreams to paying. For example, my youngest brother playing in soccer team this is good for him, and he says me everything in the team is wonderful and is a inspiration for him because he has a the most wonderfully experiences in the sports. Students can be more productive at school and in their activities, because the schools bring the opportunity to parctice some sport.

I truly believer that having the school has a control in the students involvement in extracurricular activities can be more would better is the right step towards a more convenient and enjoyable educational experience, and considered that schools offered the potential that students have to developed their potential, by and large school count with the necessary instruments that students needed, lastly school helped the students a level physical with the sports, I hope my voice get heard to the schools and their make this issues, schools can be more productive if their has the control with the students.",3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,3.0
3C693CBFEFB5,"Have you ever wanted to know if your attending a classes from home does it benefit you ? Many students want to be educated and successful but, many problems come in there way causing public or private schools not to be the best decision for them. They decide they want to do school online and have said it has befitted them so much because, when they were doing public school they were failing there classes or the problems they were facing got harder for them to be in school. Many students have done online school and have been so successful and not only being successful but it has benefited them in whatever situation They're in right now.

Although some may argue otherwise, but through family experiences, prodcasts i've watched on the radio, and from hearing some celebrities talk.

One of my cousins named Generic_Name has been through so much and has not been able to continue going to public school. she's struggling a lot trying to keep her grades up and trying to get to school on time. she has an eating disorder. An eating disorder can be really hard at times when dealing with that and school . Her family has decided to let her do online school , and has helped her so much because while being at home eating and also going to doctor appointments she has the option to do her assignments online and also sometimes some teachers come to her house do homework assignments with her that help her a ton. Through online school she has overcame her struggle with her eating disorder and has also been so successful. As many years went by she has studied more an more. ""it's so crazy""

because while having so many problems she was facing she became a lawyer.

Some may argue that it's impossible how she became a lawyer after just doing online school, that its unfair how she got to where she is now because of home schooling, some people may say that by doing online school it can't benefit you nor can it make you a successful person it's just they way to failure. That's not true because when you hear so many stories and people talking about their experiences with home schooling you have to take to consideration that maybe it helps some and not others.

Many prodcasts on the radio have mentioned many real life situations on this subject . One i've heard that struck out to me was when this mom was talking about her son Generic_Name being really popular on social media, She said that all throughout his high school years students his age and older have been bullying him and trying to get in fights with him for no reason. The mom signed her son up for online schooling. Generic_Name did online school as well as he did video conferences with his teachers every other day . Generic_Name has found it to be more easy he said that he is more concentrated because, it's just him and his laptop there's no distractions no more students bothering him trying to fight him. Since social media is such a big thing to keep up with when doing online school ,he can do both social media and be educated. However, some may argue that Generic_Name has to be a man and grow up, he can't always hide from people that are mean to him. That's true he can't always hide from people like that, but if he's fed up with it then maybe it was the best decision you can only handle so much hate.

Celebrities have talked in their interviews about them choosing home school over school and how beneficial it was to them. There's this girl named Generic_Name .She said Being big on social media is really hard Dealing with the hate, dealing with people exposing you constantly for nothing, dealing with your name always being in people's mouth. Generic_Name has said that she's been bullied so many times and has found it harder for to deal with it. She has said that at one point she got depression and got harder and harder for her to continue going to public schools. Teachers recommended her to do online school. She took that advice and did home schooling for the rest of high school and also did online school for college as well. She said that she feels more successful. Generic_Name said that online school was the best thing she did and that she decided that for college she is going to a public college and she is also going to continue being big on social media. Some may argue that, They don't see how it benefited her. It have a major change on her, she knew what she wanted to do or be so how did it benefit her. It benefited her in so many ways, she no longer is afraid of what people think of her on social media. Sometimes people need space from public school and then when they feel that they are ready they can go to public schools again.

The importance is for people that are going through the same problems for them to look and read from past experiences. For them to see if online school is beneficial for them. In the future people can look back at this and see what people were going through and how much they were struggling. This helps to see about how the past was like to compare to how it's like now. A solution is for people to do online school if they feel like being in public school is harder for them or for, whatever reason it may be. Also for people to notice and to realize that as being said multiple times that for people that are big on social media It's hard to cope with all the hate they get. A solution is for people not to give hate to others. ",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0
3C78D0790E7B,"Is Emerson right about the statement he wrote? Emerson's statement stated that ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" I agree with this statement because it lets you know that anyone can push for a higher acomplishment in their own life. As well, reading the passage gets people thinking on their goals, if they should push to reach for higher limits. I'll tell you why Emerson's statement is right.

As a start, many people are inspired by Emerson's statement and its made them believe more in themself. Having a powerful statement can really open other peoples eyes to strive for high goals. As well, push boundries that they never thought they had. People with start to have faith knowing they can rise above their own expectations. For example, many people give up and stop trying to reach their goals. Then they have no idea on what they want to do or what they can manage to do.

In fact, people who past beyond thier own boundries have a successful life style. They start to know what they can handle and how to fully succeed, It make them feel like they can complete any type of task that they're given. People start to feel better on themself knowing what the can do. Some people say its a weight lifting feeling they get once they find out what they were missing out on. For example, people ened up over thinking things and made it harder on them self for not achiving the goals.

As a matter of fact, People end up gaining more experiance on what they do. They also start to want to take on new challenges so they can have more experiance. They want to be filled with many different ways to have a strong mind and successful life style. People who has gained so much experiance can get any type of work within seconds because of their experiance, nothing has ever stop someone from believing they can do more. For example, people with the most experiance struggle less for work.

In conclusion, Emerson's statement shows a strong componet in peoples lifes. Making it one of the most insperational quotes that has ever existed. People start to end up valuing in themself more then they ever thought they could. People who can't do things that are beyond their own ability hasn't grown yet. Many of the people are too scared to reach for higher expectaions when they have the ability to take it.

This will give students no excuse for being behind with school work if their able to do classes from home.

Students that are often sick, or miss a lot of school because of personal reasons would have an advantage with doing their classes from home. If students have the opportunity to do classes from home they dont have to stress about returning to school, and having a lot of class work to make up.

When i had my surgery last school year it was nearly impossible for me to catch up on all my missing work, the only way i could do my class work was if someone picked it up from school. Unfortunately my parents both work so while i was out of school i had no way to do it from home. It was very difficult to finish all that work after getting back, because i was not given many options of getting the work done. If i was given the option to complete my class work from online this would have really helped me maintain my grades up.

Seniors might be in the position where they need more than the usual amount of classes to graduate by their final year. Having to be in such a difficult position and only being able to attend morning or night school can make it harder to get these classes done on time. This will only make it stressful, and discourage students to get the classes done by the time of graduation. Not only do some seniors have jobs after school but having to attend a full day of school, and either morning or night school can be tiring and overwhelming. Overdoing yourself can also decrease the amount of people that pass their classes because of the reason that they have to much to get done in a matter of one school year,so allowing students to do some classes online will make it easier for more students to graduate.

The idea of online classes might sound difficult for some students because they tend to learn better face to face. Schools can offer virtual teaching lessons for those who have an issue with attending all their classes at school and learn better by someone verbally explaining each concept to them. Not all students have computers at home which is understanding, in order for students to complete online classes from home they will need a computer,schools can offer students a borrowed computer or laptop in order for them to participate in online classes. Schools can Introduce a system where they provide for those who need the help of obtaining a computer and to still be able to do their classes from home. By providing for those who need the computers, students will not be held back from the idea of doing classes from home just because they dont own a computer.

Having the choice of doing classes from home can be very beneficial to students. This gives students the opportunity to complete more classes and actually do them without having the excuse of being absent to school. Given the chance of doing classes from home can increase the passing levels for more classes. The idea of doing classes from home can be helpful for students who need it, and encourage students who need the option of at home classes to actually get these classes done from home. I think all schools should have an option that allows students to do classes from home.        ",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0
3D8CF58944E1,"I think schools shouldn't add one and a half hours more to schools because kids need time to rest there brains, have enough time to make it on time to there after school activities, and students need more time to finish up their homework and studying.

First, kids need time to rest there brains by going outside, and watching on the TV for a little.

If schools add more time, then students will not have any time to have fun which causes them to not have much time to sleep, less time to sleep effects their school day. An example of that is if I had extra time to my school then I would have had no time to play, take a nap, or watch youtube. That causes me to not have enough sleep time. This type of rule is not healthy for the students.

Second, kids need time to make it to there after school activities. after school activities are usually straight after school, but if students add more time to school then kids will not make it to his or her after school activity. An example is if a student had to go to football practice everyday at 4:00, then students would not make it if school ended at 4:15. without physical education and only just education by sitting in a chair just writing and reading is not healthy for your body. that's why students need more time for there after school activities. this is also bad because it effects your sleep time also which makes you tired for school the next day.

Last, students will not have enough time to finish up there homework from all the time from school and other stuff they have to do at home. For an example is if there was a test the next day, and I havn't studied so I had to study, I wouldn't have had enough time to study because the extra time in school or if I had to do an after school activity. This is not good for students to add time to school so they do not have enough time to study or finish homework because they will not get a good grade on the test or quiz and especially get a bad grade in the class.

Back to the thesis, they should not add an hour and a half of school because it will effect our brain, body, and grades. It will affect it by being late or not showing up to his or her after school activity, less time for the kids brain to rest, and not having time to finish homework or to study.

Why would people want to add time to school?",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5
3DAC64829E27,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attent classes from home?

on my opinion students would not like the idea of taking more time to study, because nowdays students are very busy, stressed, and tired of school, they would not like to have to hear more stuff that has to do with school . besides some people are more smart and they could take the class just to see how thats going to help, but sometimes people dont try the stuff and thats why, they never know if they are going to like it or not.

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students from home by way of online video conferencing

I think, students are not going to have any benefit to attent classes from home. some of the studends have to work, do stuff at home, or stay in school on other activities. students sometimes, actually need some help with some classes but they might not like to be taking the classes at home, The studend taking the class at home could get distracted by so many things at his house. While some other studends that have better grades and like school they could take the class, but they also will have homework and things to do at home.

Students would not get any benefits by taking classes at home because, the online class could be also start teaching the same work that the teacher already teach you, or either the online class could be teaching different ways how to solve a problem that the student will get very stressed and after that its not going to be able to learn something from it and instead helping the student the online class is going to make it more difficult.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5
3DC539E4E871,"I believe that if some school districts offer programs that allow to graduated in three years instead of the traditional four years, It couldn't be a good idea, Because most students following this plan must take course during the summer or in the evenings.

One reason is that students may be not able to get the enough knowledge because the time in class must be less than the normal time in school.

Second reason is that even if students graduated early from high school, students won't be able to take elective course.

Third reason is that some students work during summer or at night time so it couldn't be a good a idea

.

In conclusion i can say that if some schools offer programs that allow students to graduated in three years instead of four even if it sounds good it is not a good idea, because most of this students must take the course during summer so there are some reason why it couldn't be the best way in order to graduated, including that some students may be not able to get enough knowledge, and some students have to work in summer time.",3.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0
3DCF3E6F4A13,"Well most students enjoy summer vacation because was one of the most beautiful station in the year for one all of students, they enjoy with the families, friends that things in the summer, though some teacher say the summer break is too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall.

I think that summer is one of the most special station or period because you share more with your Family, Friends, and all students have merit to share more with the most important persons in their lives because a lot of our parents working 10 to 12 hours of Monday to Saturday in sometimes Sunday too, and they don't have a lot of time to share with they families.

In my case, I love when it's summer vacation because I have a lot and good experiences with my Family, with God when left to the house our going to different places, I feel that is these period is when I share more with my mom, She is the most important person in my life, she is who are always with me in the good and bad things, she is who give me advice every day about the good and bad things to not make that things that I don't need to do and don't pass for a lot of things that she pass when she was young, I love these time of summer because is when I pass more time with my mom and she help me to be better every day in my School, Work, Church and everywhere that going.

The mother is one of the most important person what I have in my life because she is who always are in there for me and help to always be good person, good in my school and a lot of more things. And I have beautiful experiences with God and these is that I love more is to pass my time with God because I learn more about things important and that help my life.

I think the 2 months that all students have to summer is a good time because are pass like 9 months in school and these is too much because sometimes you want to make something but school is to difficult and that people can't to share with special people.

Well when the educators or teachers say that summer vacation is too long because student do not retain the information is not true because the students retain these information about Works, Projects, Homework, Classwork the information is in our Brain, Mind, are that things important and basic.

I don't agree that person argue should be year-round and that only have 3-4 weak breaks in the summer is like only one month and you can't enjoy and make your summer funny with you parents because you are thinking in school, I don't be agree with these the summer is when you can pass more time with your important person because there is the period when they have the vacation to, I thing the summer is for enjoy and pass a funny time with your Mom, Father, Brothers, Sisters, and all your Family.

I say that is good to have 2 months and like 2 weeks of vacation because you clearing you Mind, you don't thing in a lot of Homework or Works of School. I have one experience in my life when I were in Generic_City that only thing that I have in my MInd was Homework, Projects, Presentations in my School, Programs of my School and one day my family say I want to going to share with all and I say I can't go because I have a lot of work to do and I need to finished and my uncle say Generic_Name is time to share with your family, is time to you clearing your mind about school and I say another time I need to finish my works about school and all my family going to share and I stay in my house working in all my projects of school and I sit in my room, I was thinking you loss beautiful time with my family for to make my works, and I say is time to you share more with your family because your family in every moment stay there.

Everything the specific moment when you have time with share with your family, friends share because you don't not in what moment you can loss your Mom, Father, Brothers, Uncle, Sisters, Aunt, Cousins, etc, when is time to school make all your works in time.

Don't take you Education like obligation, taken like one of the opportunity to be better.

In some moments you have difficult time but you need to continue, to be stronger, the education is where you learn more about the all things Human, Animals, Solar System, H2o and a lot of things important what help you life in the future you learn things what in your future you can put in practice, you can teaches another person that need to know more.

For everything have time, your Family, Works, Friends, School all these things depends about you, for these reason I think When is time to school is school, When is time to your family is family.

So you need to think and put your agenda in order to you make the important things in order so right now I change a lot of things in my life and these it is the Monday to Friday to be concentrate in my Education, Saturday to Sunday in God and my family, when it's time to pass with my family I pass time with my family and now I share more.

And for these reason I think the summer vacation is important because a lot of students don't have their parents in here maybe live 8 hours, 10 hours in when it's vacation they going to pass time with their Parents.

You need to be have the order in your life you need to make time for everything.

The Education is important because is where you learn things important but most important for me is my family because they can one day no be in here in the Earth because they dead.

And I think when it's summer vacation the Educators or teacher enjoy to their vacation and pass good time with their family and when it's time to come back to school review somethings because not everything forget somethings are in the brain that only need to do is to review.

Then the summer vacation are so good 2 months and 2-3 weeks to you enjoy with all the persons important and special to you, so enjoy and pass a funny summer vacation.

So enjoy, teachers don't thing the summer is too long because is a shorter period that one student have for vacation, teacher enjoy vacation!!.",2.0,2.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0
3F80F96A6F5A,"Some people believe in praising a students to help them build self-esteems. They believe that students must be self-confident in order to learn. On the other hand, other people believe that self-esteems comes from achievements. I think that self-esteems comes from both learning and achievements, but it mostly come by telling a students that there work is good for these three reasons. One reason is that people are giving good complement to student for their work that the student have done, sometime people would want to have the stuff the students would create, and last people would say nice thing to students so the other people wouldn't hurt their feeling.

The first reason is that people are complementing to student for their work that student have created. Some people would say nice things and walk away or they would stay and talk about what the student made and the meaning behind what the student created. I remember when I was a little kid, I built a toy car and my mom like it. So when i'm older, I want to create my own car and show my mom how good I am at building cars. My mom was the one who has help me boost my self-esteem. That is what teachers should do to student if they want to boost their self-esteem.

Another reason, is that sometime people would want to have the stuff that students would create. For example, say if you made a painting and someone on the street saw it. Then the person would want to buy it and you sold it to him. That would make you want to create even more painting and sell it. It would make the student think that the person like your painting that you created and that boost you into selling more painting. The more stuff you create. The more people would want to buy it. That is an another reason to help boost students self-esteems.

The last reason is that people would say nice thing so they won't hurt your feeling, But they do that because there jealous that they can't do the stuff that you can create. There are some people in the world that just give you hateful comment about your creation. And that doesn't mean that you can stop doing what you want to do. It doesn't matter because there are other people that are gonna like the thing that you create. There are people out there that maybe want to buy your stuff probably even a famous person would want to buy it.

In conclusion, people would try to believe in students so they could have self-esteem. But there also people out in the word that maybe don't like the stuff that you create. But there also people that do like the stuff that you create. That is why people are giving good complement to student for their work that the student have done, they sometime would want to have the stuff that students would create, and last people would say nice thing to students so the other people wouldn't hurt their feeling.",4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.5
4002D91C6B6C,"In some school districts they offer programs which allows students to graduate in three years rather than four years as normal. Which means students would be a year early for college and a year early in the workforce. Allowing high school students to graduate in three year is not a good idea because they won't be able to attend more elective classes in school, they will start stressing about a lot of school work, and they won't be able to enjoy their four years of high school with friends.

Trying to graduate early is not the best because it could be so stressful, focusing on getting good grades and passing in a short amount of time. As the University of Virginia did an experiment on teenagers, that which they should not be putting too much stress on themselves. As some students like to work and want to succeed in the future so they think it's faster and easier to graduate early. You should be in high school for four years as traditionally and not trying to rush through your high school years and graduate.

You should enjoy your years of high school, as normal sometimes we have stress because it's too much of work, but four years you get to have more fun classes. As three years you won't be able to be in elective classes, which it could lead to less opportunities. During summer you have to do school work so you can be able to graduate and also after school you have to do work. Some might think that four years of high school is too much but it's really not that much, you really won't feel when the years pass by.

In the other hand some students think that being in high school for only three years it's a good idea because they think that it's easier to get away from people and dramas, faster to start working, going to college faster, and they are rushing through life. They want to succeed but the faster way and they don't want to be in high school because they think it's too long and it takes a lot of years through their lives.

As in some school districts they offer programs which allows students to graduate in three years rather than four years as normal. Allowing high school students to graduate in three years in not a good idea because it's too much stress about school work, they won't be able to be in elective classes, and they won't enjoy their high school years with friends.

400E5AA27067,"It has been said that first impressions are impossible to change, I disagree with this stiemant. The reason

I disagree with this is because first of all first impressions are a snap chat of who you are.

Second of all the more time you spend with a person the more likely that they will change there mind of who they thought you were from the first time they meet you. At this time of peride people are starting to get the idea that first impressions are't always correct, so they are willing to give a second chance.

First impressions are a snap chat of who you are, for me personally first impressions are always heard because based on the few second I spend talking to a person they will always think of me as that person specie if am never going to see them aging. Job interview is a big one because based on how you present your self at that moment of time will determan whether you get the job or not, and you might get nerves and act a sertine way that will not help you get the job even tho that's not who you really are. For example like a year ago I had soccer tryouts for a big soccer team the whole month I have been training and feeling good, but when the day came I was nerves because I never had the chance to tryout for a big team like that. I ended up not getting into the soccer team because the whole time I was worried what time the coaches will think of me and they were not impress with me the first, but this year I made it into the team the coaches liked me because I was much comfortable on the ball this time then last time and the coaches changed there mind about me . What am trying to say is first impressions are not impossible to change.

The more time you spend with a person the more likely that they will change there mind, Sometimes you will like person based on for the few seconds you seen them or talk to them, but then when you spend more time with me you come to find out that they are not as much as inserting as they seam. For example I had this kid in my class he was funny and seem inserting. but the more I got to now him i found out that he is funny when they are a group of people around him but when you talk to him one on one he is like a whole different person. This just goes to show that it is not just bad first impressions that are not impossible it's the good one's too.

People are starting to get the idea that first impressions are't always correct, Job are starting to understand that first impressions are not always correct for that reason they are willing to have two job interviews with. Sometimes it might be first on the phone than in person or just have two job interviews in person and I think that is a good idea spicily for people like me who are not good at first impressions.

inconclution,

Some people might say first impressions are impossible to change and I can see where they are coming from, but all am trying to say is the more time you spend with a person you are going to have more understanding of who they are. The only time I would say first impressions are almost impossible to change is if you are going to see the person just for one time and never see them aging. If that is the case than what ever the image of you they have that will just be it but be sides that first impressions are not impossible to change.",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0
40DD3FF566D8,"How many times you try to give up, how many times you wake up, there is a lot of difficult things in the life. While many are discouraging by going into failure to failure but never give up, stay happy keep working hard and you'll find success. I'm firmly agree to Churchill words, no matter what, you have to keep the enthusiasm and keep working hard to get success. There is a lot of difficult parts in the life for example I was a clearly example of this because I went to failure to get success. When I was in 10 grade I take for the first time the Geometry Test, I was so nervous because I was going to take one of most difficult exams that I have never take it and yes I fail and then I take it 3 more times and I fail again. After 3 times of failure I take some minutes to think about it. And I say what is the best thing that I can do, Well the best way is preparing my self to take the test again. Finally after 4 times I pass it, and this situation give a big lesson never,

never loss the enthusiasm never give up, failure make me learn new things that will help me to improve and be success. One of my reason for this should be that

I have to had the Geometry test to be available to graduate that was the reason that motivate my self to pass the test.

Another difficult part of my life was when I move to this country, it was very painful because I leave all my family in my old country and all my friends that I know from my infancy, but that is not the very difficult part. when I move to this country I never though that the language would be a problem but i was wrong. It's very hard when see someone talking to you but you can't understand, it's feels pretty bad. Then I start to study English to improve my pronunciation and understand better, but like I say before I never give up I keep working and I will find success. My reason for this is that I want to a better future and I know that if I speak two languages I will have a better future.

My conclusion to all this would be that no matter what you have to keep the enthusiasm even if you fail many times keep working hard and you'll find success.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5

she told me ""son always go for whats good but don't go through the bad path.""

When you learn from others experience you become a better person.

However don't learn from bad influences they'll bring you down.

friends that are doing bad things are influences you don't need to follow their actions in order to become a better person just talk to a wise person they might give you a good advice.

41EAC230D430,"People who have a lot of experience in life have started off the same way as everyone one else, from the bottom. Their first ever job was something that they probably had never done before, this makes it so that they had to learn and adapt to something they were unfamiliar with. Hiring these people, people who had little to no experience to what they are now are the one who went on in life by learning and adapting. Hiring new people can also benefit employers in a positive way, by having someone with no experience can help grow that person professionally. Also finding someone with a lot of knowledge at something may be difficult for they all have jobs that require experience. This in the end can make it hard for employers to find someone just right for the position they need

Hiring someone who doesn't have experience in the job position you are looking for can be a good thing, first, it can help the employee discover skills for themselves and outside of the job, second, it can or will make the employee much better and more reliable for the position. New employees need a mentor or someone who can show them the correct ways to do the job and who ever the mentor is, it can help them grow their leadership skills dramatically. Having skill diversity among the group can also be very beneficial it can result in the new employees finding new ways to manage things on the job and may even find ways to replace the old rules for better ones. Some people are fast learners so he/she will adapt to the new work environment very easily. Building up experience is a key part in life and and some point there will be a time to get a job and seeing that everyone has started from the bottom, and hiring someone new can really benefit the company and the employer

Do i think that employers should hire someone that doesn't have any experience at something; yes, once hiring he/she the employee will do whatever it takes to keep that job and find new ways to grow while on the job. it is also a good way to expand company diversity and skills.

In the end, anyone who is looking for a job should be given an opportunity to learn and acquire skills to become better and stronger experience wise. Employers should mostly take notice on how ready and determined he/she is for the job rather than hoe much experience they have. At some point even the employer was given a chance so whoever the person may be should also be given a chance at this opportunity.

In my opinion working with a group make things more easy and fun because students have the chance to exchange ideas and also learn more from each others it als help us to see things from different points of view.

First, working with a group make things more easy for students because they will all work together in each part of the assignment, one student can do the research while the other one write the information the other student can be looking for graphs or other information that they might need, students also get to have fun by working with a group because they can talk to each others and also laugh from their mistakes .

In addition, students have the opportunity to learn no just the topic of the assignment but also learn from each other, working with a group gives us the opportunity to exchange ideas and toughts it also help us to see the differfents points of view,by working with a group we also get help from each others because if one student does not know the answer to a questions the other students might have the right answer.

Last, for some students working with a group makes them feel more comfortable because they can help each other and support the different positions and ideas, by working all together they will have better result and they will learn more by having discussions and sharings their different opinions.

In conclusion working with a group have more benefits because the students learn more and have better results, they learn more from each other, they discuss the different points of view and they also learn to respect and listen to the different positions that they have.

430762044028,"Why they are think studnets should have classes from home by way of online or video conferencing? Many of the studnets home is to far and maybe can't come or is come let. Every schools should have this option for students. This is make easy for some students.

First,some students wanna to stay home for classes this is good thing because you can fouces carfully and take you time and no body can't make you obsess. Some students maybe just need focuse to classes and he can't do in schools and he want to be school home. For Example; We have firend family him name is Generic_Name,Generic_Name wanted to be home school and do work in home. He do like to come school early. He told to him Mother and Father but they are is not agree with him because they says you have to go school and you can learning better and he do not have any option and he start to go school.

Second,the student want to stay home school they should know home school make your lazy because you don't have any activity to do you you stay home all time. For friendship you can't find good friend. this is make you unfriendly. for the class maybe you not understand what teachers means and you have some question. For Example;Generic_Name she is school home and she all time in home she doesn't have any friend she talk with her mother and father and her mother father is agree with she and she start to go school and she find alot friend and she understand better then befor.

Lastly,some teachers like to teach online and I think this is good option to for teachers because maybe teachers can teach better and maybe can foucse better then in class. Some teachers go to students home for the teaching just for one student and focuse to just one student. For Example;Generic_Name every Thusday have teacher she come every Thusday in Generic_Name home and she was help to Generic_Name to all home work. she talk to Generic_Name about home teacher is good then teacher in school because you focuse just for one student but in school you focuse just for maybe twenty students this is to hardc for me.

Studnets, should go schools this is not matter do you want go home school or normal school. some students have some physically problem I think they are need home schools because is easy then school because in school maybe somebody push and like some accident. For the physically students schools home is good because they can learning easly and they can focause better and nobody obsses.

Some students, need go school for the understand better. Some students need go school because if they are stay in home and they want home schools maybe in not listen to teacher or make copy.

4353BF70C4A3,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Schools goal is to offer for students classes from home to make sure students do their best in order to pass and graduate. Students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students love the idea of taking their courses at home, will have more time to do any activities they could not do in school day time, and its more easier.

First, students love the idea of taking classes at home because students do not have to wake up early for school, that give students more time to sleep and all of us know how important to get your daily hour sleep on our brains. Also, it's good for students who are shy for what ever reasons. I know someone who took classes at home for third and fourth quarters, so he didn't have to go to school. The classes he took started at six PM every Monday and Wednesday. This guy told me that online classes were helpful for him and made him pass.

Second, students will have more time to do any activities. Schools started at eight AM and ends at three PM. At this time, students could do any thing like working in the morning time or help parents in anything or do anything else. Students could use this seven hours to do anything that may help them in the future. As I said before, online classes start at six PM and ends at eight PM. Generic_Name, my closest friend, took classes at home, so he could work and get money.

Students take classes at home at home because it's more easier. Many students said that is better to take our classes at home because it's more easier and teachers teach in really simple way that make anyone understand than what school do. Students wants to pass so they takes the easy way that the school offer to pass, and as I said before, schools offer distance learning to make students succeed. Generic_Name, one of my best friends, took online classes, and he told me that's his teacher was really good because of the way that the teacher taught them back then, makes everything easier and simple that even a kid could understand it.

Schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home not just because it's easy or can attend it from home. Schools goal is to make sure we succeed on this classes, and that's what schools here for. Is to open the way for us to create the future because if students are 20% of our present, they are 100% of our future. Some people or students do not like the idea of taking classes from home and will disagree with me. After all everyone have his own way of thinking and living.

43B0E1211D58,"School is a very important part in a person's life, however it takes away most of student's and teacher's day. In a normal public middle school in Maryland, a student first class starts at 8:15 in the morning and the last class ends at 3:00 pm. Which means that a student spends 7 hours and 25 minutes in school, that is a long time for a person to be receiving information nonstop. The school board should not extend the school day, because that would take time away from activities that students need or will need in the future, such as: students would have less time to do homework or study, students would have less time to participate in after school activities like sports, and students wouldl have less time to volunteer in community events.

Students would have less time to do homework or study. Students already spends more than seven hours at school and usually has 6-8 classes that last 45 minutes each from those 6-8 classes at least

3 would have assigned homework to the students which means that the students would need time to complete their homework with accuracy, if the school days werre extended students would have less time to complete their homework which means that their grade might go decrease for missing assignments.

Students would have less time to participate in after school activities such as sports, or clubs.

Every healthy person should exercise for at least 1 hour per day and at school not every student takes physical education (P.E.) as a course which leads to the thought that students might not me be getting the necessary amount of exercise per day, and even if a student did take P.E. a normal class lasts 45 minutes, which is not enough for a healthy person. If the school board were to add one and a half hours to the school day students would have less time to practice in an after school team. Clubs are just like sports are a very big thing in a school, clubs shows students opportunities they usually would not get in a school day. if the school board were to extend the school day students that are parts of clubs would probably get less time to spend time in those clubs.

Students will have less time to volunteer in community events. Community service is usually a requirement in most curiculums, in past experiences I have had to have 75 hours of community service those hours were earned for volunteer work, like helping a teacher with younger students or helping a teacher organize her classroom before the school year, etc. . Those acts were usually done after school and usually took around 2 hours. If the school board were to extend the school day srudents would have less time to finish their community service and could eventually fail beacause of not enough volunteering hours.

Overall it is just more convienient for the school board to not add anymore hours to the school day so students can have more time for their other activities like sports clubs and community service",3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

I would like to tell you about how I think about doing community service. The reason I wanted to tell you about this is because I understand that some students would like to do community service and not others. In my opinion I think there should be a reason why some of the students want to do community service and not others. If the students that want to do community service can do that. If there is only a small group of people than it would not be a good way to have the work done. Please consider this and if you don't like this than it will be fine to me. My other reason is not everyone would like to pick up liter. It might not be what students want to do during there free time. I understand that your the principal of this school and not every principal would consider this opinion because you believe that everyone should do community service. I all so understand that it is very important to do community service around the school and you can learn many things from doing community service and I also like to tell you that there should be a list of places that there going to do service at.

447221C3FA00,""" Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm""

Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". The thing is that if we going to do something good we have to failure anyways because for example, we are excited and we are going with enthusiasm to get a great results, but you never fail in the life and your enthusiasm is up. Success is failure one, two, trhee time. You are a human without loss enthusiasm is hard because some people have not enthusiasm to do the right things don't have power and are weak when herad something bad. I'm agree with him because to be a successfuly in the future your going to failre a lot of time. I have a friend that told me to get success in the life have to to fail and don't loss enthusiasm.

For me fail in my life is not something really bad, but just a little bit, you can keep getting good without problem. This is a important role because all people can think what they have to do about failure and how they can be preparate when their enthusiasm is up and later is down. Failure for me is not a mistake because by those mistake you learn and you can be better person. Some reason to be agree with him is that is true, you have to fail first and happens what the happens. Some people are not agree with this statement because they think that if you fail you going to be bad and your enthusiasm going down. Support ideas is not easy because this world have different kind of people with different kind of mind. Good examples to be success is do the best thing and if you fail don't say nothing to nobody, just do it and that sit. Some teenegers have the same problems everyday because when they are fail they think that something happen going to happen to them but they are their success to consist of going from failure.

In my conclusion I'm going to say that if you want to success in your life is necessary to fail because you learn from experience, you going to do everything right. For me in my future I'm not going to say nothing about failin g because I'm going to be calmly because I knew that with experience could be preparate for my problems. We have to be positive each day because you going to remember all the failure that you had in your past. I think fail is not bad for my life because it going to be a great experience.

44B06B4A6D7E,"Schools offer distant learning as an option for student's who likes work from home, can there be good or bad benefits from working at home?. I think that working at home would not benefit student's, reason being home is more comfortable and relaxing .Working at a public school can help you get opportunity's with friend's or teacher's like a job or college career. Public school is more efficient because, other students can help you out on work and at home no one is there to ask for help. Talking to a teacher in person can be so much more helpful then on a computer . Staying after school is a big benefit to people who prefer public school because you can get work done that is needed, but at home I feel like you can't get the same help you need on the work.

Working from home can have its benefits like being with family more often. Working from home can be challenging for some people because home is more comfortable therefore the student would become more lazy and get bad grades. One thing about working at home is you would make your own schedule which could be flexible to your own time. Students who work at home would have no one to help them out with work outside of class which would be hard on the student

Students who go to public schools will benefit more then the students that work at home. Public schools bring more opportunity's as distant learning would not get as many . This issue could be solved depending on the student, some students like to be at home and some like to go to public schools . Public schools help student's with college information and helps the student choose his path in life. Working in a public school environment, helps more students do better in there classes makes them more productive. ",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0
44D395C2AD83,"The success can consists from failure to failure. Sometimes life is hard but never loss your enthusiasm. Not everything in life is going to be great as you planned. From your mistakes you learn something new or how can you succes in something that you fail. You always need to think positive doesn't matter if you fail and fail again but you going to have success in your life just believe that you can do it.

First, Many times in your life you will feel like you cannot do it anymore but never give up you have to keep goin until you reach your goal. Life can be hard and you can fail many times but never loss your faith. Your enthusiasm and your faith fot what you want to reach is going to be your better weapons in your success. Never loss your enthusiasm because, you can reach your success but nothing in life is always easy.

Second, Mistakes or failure are good in life because, thats is what teach you what you are doing wrong or what can you do for reach your success. I know many people that had been in many mistakes or failures, but they never give up and they had been patience to be successful in life. Sometimes people think if they fail one time, they cannot do it better next time or improve. Your failure, is not always bad as you think it is.

Third, People sometimes fail and they are close from reach their goals or they success, but they think that everything is done. If you believe in your self that you can do it and you have faith everything will be possible in your life. People think that an obstacle in your life will be an excuse to not keep going and reach your success. Sometimes you have to pass for many obstacles in your life because like I said life is not easy and every success need sacrifice.

Finally, In life to have success you have to work hard and sacrifice in order to reach your success. Failure is a big obstacle in your life because, it can make you to give up and not try or continue reaching your goal or success. Faith, bellieve in your self, pray for what you want and work hard these are some facst that can keep pushing you for your success. If you think you cannot do something that you never have done and you are scare to fail just try, doesn't matter if you do it wrong, but you are going to learn what you cannot do next time. Failure help you to pursuit your success and it's something that all humans we have to do because we are not perfects.  ",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5
44E2726DA1B3,"Your principal has decided all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree because now days all kids do is stay home and be on there phones and do nothing. I know that because I used to do the same thing before and i didn't like to do anything at all but then I started playing a sport and it help a lot but i think that. Participating in a extracurricular activity may help you by staying healthy, get you out of trouble,and get you in a good college.

one example is staying healthy by playing a sport you can help prevent a lot of things like maintain a good weight, and keep you from getting sick. Keeping a good weight is good for your health because it keeps you from getting other diseases,more than 1/4 of the people in the U.S. are obese. Why not start at a young age and prevent from being sick and other things. Another thing that can help is eating healthy, we can prevent sickness to in order to do that you might want to think about trying out a new sport.

Another example is getting you out of trouble you can avoid a lot of drama. I learned that social media can get you into a lot of trouble, half of the time a lot of the drama comes from social media. Maybe if you join a club or a sports team you can think before doing something that can get you in trouble. One time my friend made the soccer team but she got in trouble so they kicked her off the team and she learned from her mistake and never got in trouble again. When in your in a cub or playing a sports half of the time you don't have time to be in drama get in trouble.

Last example is joining a club, working on the year book,serve in the student council and, playing a sport can get you into a good college now a days colleges are looking to see if you have participated in any sports or clubs. When i graduate high school i want to go to college and a study to be a general surgeon and participating in a sport or joining a club can help me get into a college. You meed new people when you join new clubs and make new friend ships. When you want to go into a club or in sports do something that you like not something your friends like or something that can help you in life with.

In conclusion staying healthy,getting out of trouble,and going into a new college can help you when you participate in a extracurricular activity. staying healthy by playing a sports and eating healthy can prevent you from getting sick. Staying out of trouble can avoid a lot of drama from school and social media think before you do something your going to regret . Joining a club or participating in a sport can help you get into the college you want and you can meet new people and make new friend ships.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0
46302B93EF09,"Dear Generic_Name,

I know you're still a little young to understand what technology means ,but I believe that technology has had a negative impact on us. Technology has increased the rates of kidnapping, human trafficking ,sexual abuse ,and murder.

Due to technology we are also losing our eye sight. It has also limited our communication skills .

Young adults usually download dating apps to meet new people ,but they don't understand the risk they can get them self into. For example they usually meet someone online and start talking. After awhile the guy probably ask her out on a date to go for a dinner ,and of course the girl is going to say yes because she's interest in the guy. Few days later the guy ask her out on another date to go and watch a movie ,but he say's that he's going to pick her up; and that were it all start she get in the car thinking he going to take her to the movies ,but instead he's taking her somewhere else he's going to kidnapping her and she doesnt know. she goes missing for weeks and no one knows where she's at. A few days later they find her body dead.

Now in day more and more people are using glasses. Technology is ruining our eye vision. People that work in offices are more likely to be using glasses now in day. They sit all day looking that their computer ,but they don't realize that their eye sight is getting bad. Young adults are also using glasses too because they use their phone to much or watch to much TV . One way to prevent that is you could put your light dimer on your computer and phone. You could also set your self a limit for how long you're going to use your phone or computer.

Another reason why technology is bad because it limits our communication skills. More people are getting used to working independently. Teacher will usually give us a project assignment; we can either work with a partner or work independently. Most students like to work independently because they don't like to rely on someone else finishing the part they had to work on for the project and not doing it. We are also able to text or video chat with other people instead of talking to them in person. By talking to someone in person it can also increase your self esteem.

In conclusion these are my reason why I believe that technology is not good for us. Technology has impacted us a lot in society. We need to be more careful and caution about the new technology we are going to be inventing in the future. we also need to be careful with the action we take. No one can predict what going to happen in the future.",4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5
4668B9F74078,"When you try new things you learn and when you learn you grow.

Do not conform of what you already have try to be better, because if you do not try you would not get chance to do thing and you probability would not grow. In my opinion you should try new things and not be stock in what you already mastered because ,You can learn new things, You can grow as a individual and as a community and You can help others.

When you try new things we learn because the make us grow,

for example if you want to open a buisness of finances in your community but you do not know how because you never try to do it you ask someone that have already mastered of doing it and you can start doing your buisness because you already try and you learn how to do it. another example would be going to college and there is a class that you already know because you take it in high school and you explain the thing to your friend and you are a mastered doing it and one of you friends ask you for another class problem but you do not because you haven try the class but it sound interesting and you want to try it because you want to learn new thing and try not matter what your situation is in your life be confident of your self. other example would be try to cook and learn your self that can teach you that you can try by your self and learn by your self but you try and that what it matter you try.

Try new thing help you learn and learn help you grow as an individual and as a community for example you grow as an individual because you take the class that you friend ask you before and you did it answer him because you haven even try then you try and become a mastered doing it and you open a buisness the community start growing and you open more buisness you become more important and the community grow more as well as you and you became someone important for the community and you keep having chance to be better every time that you learn you start helping people that do not have a chance to imprube them self. an for teach your self of cooking is a motivation to other to try the same thing.

You can help people when you grow because you learn how to do the work and now you teach the work to other to they can have a better chance in life giving them a place to work and having them grow as well the community grow because the buisness that you open people was more interesting in your buisness and they make you offers and tell you to work with them but you are scared that you work may not work but you remember that if you do not try and stay of what you are mastered you would not grow. cooking your self help the community to have people to get in head and teach others.

Even if you do not have try something and you think you can do it and you fell, you would be more sad that you do not try before you do it or ask someone for help that ready do it is a big mistake, try before you do not grow ,you do not have to be conform of what you already have because you can help others and make your self be proud and cooking for other and tell then that you learn by your self is a inspiration to other do the some thing and the way that you grow as trying thing would make the community more interesting try to grow before you give up.",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,3.5

As may many people say that the negative attitude is way to succeed, however, a positive attitude, explain the performances of your doing for example Generic_Name got 50 out of 100, which she wanted on her presentation not because she did not do the work properly,but because the way she present her presentation and she was scared and nervous to present it in front of everyone. It was majorly graded on her performance, but next time she practiced her way to present her presentation five-six times and thought about how she can do this and she doesn't have to be scared of anything and she got 100 on it, which was her goal. Also. a sports team lose few time because the players not getting along or one is better than other, which they can change by thinking equally and being friendly to each other. It shows the optimistic behavior of human supports during their task.

Your past always reflects on your future. Everyone learns something from their mistakes or good memories. For example if Generic_Name did good on her presentation because she the way she presented, it illustrates that she more confident and positive to do her same presentation without worrying. If the sports player lost couple times they would not make same mistakes as they did it before. if you think and feel positives it will show it on your work. The effect changes your perspective to your life.

In conclusion, the way you display your input in feeling true helps the output for your future life, Like Generic_Name positive behaving helped her getting 100 on her presentation and the way that showed on her future presentation and the sports team which practiced and improved their co working to wins the games and their future games.

I think students should perform in community service because

I'll show little kids to think of others and not just them self's because when they get older the little kids aren't going to care but if they see the older kids help maybe the little kids would think how the big kids helped n see how much they helped them and would still want to help others when they get older. The little kids always look up to the big kids. Also maybe the little kids won't gave up so easy. Helping in community service would also help the big kids because they would be thinking of other, they will feel good about them self's when their done, and that well help them get into a good collage when they are older just for helping in the community. When the older kids have kids of their own they can tell them how they helped the community and will want their kids to be in it too.

After mastered basketball, he want to baseball. Can't stay at tee ball , have to practice to get to actual baseball.

Emerson is therefore correct in stating "" Unless you try to do something beyond what have already mastered , you will never grow"" because to grow one must break out of comfort zone and failure leads to success.

Failure lead to success, comfort zone knee jerk reaction, ""well I haven't mastered anything yet so I can't adequately answer this questions"" Generic_Name's example wants to mas painting.

Opposition, mastering something is impossible scientific theories disproved got to school for 12 years, still have not learned everything therefore Emerson is wrong.

Also, Ralph Waldo Emerson Wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"". This quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson states if people do not go beyond what they have already accomplished. They will never progress in life. Some people's initial reaction would be "" I have not Masters anything, so I am unable to respond to this question."" There are a couple reasons why Emerson's quote is correct. Growing requires breaking out of comfort zones and broadening horizon. If a person does not go beyond what they are capable of archiving they will not grow. Failure assists to growing and learning to lead to success.

If people never expand their horizons, the they never experience new adventure life can offer. Without the thrill of a new experience, life would become aborning repetition of activities we have already mastered. Therefore, to break out of a comfort zone, people must go beyond what we have already mastered. One day at school, our band class attended a piano recital put on by Generic_School students. Even though, I was not part pf their piano class, I decided to perform unannounced. As I walked upon the stage, a my emotions flooded my body, such as nervous, anxious. However, to become a better piano performed, I needed to step out of my comfort zone and perform for entire piano and band classes.

In the second paragraph i gooidn to talk about the meaning about life and the possitive attitude. In the third i goint to talk about personal positive attitude.

First, I think that has a positive attitude is always good to your life and help you to give a sense a everything. We always need to has a reason to has positive attitude because without a good attitude you never getting a jod because in a jod you always to has a possitive attitude with the coustumer.

Sometimes people don't change,instead of saying that people change your impressions about them maybe you need to know your self first and see what is happening also you need to known why that person change your impressions because maybe something sad or bad is happening on their life and you don't know it.

So let me tell you an experience that happen to me a few moths ago so I met this girl and she was very nice with me and I start thinking that she was that nice with everyone and no I was wrong she only was that nice with me so I decide to date her so I tell her if she want go to see a movie next weekend and she tell me, yes! and I say great so like 3 days before going to see the movie she start acting weird and I ask her if she was OK? and she tell me yes,so the next day I start talking with her and she tell me what was happening and she tell me that her mother was sick and she was sad,so she tell me everything that was happening and I understand why she was acting weird.

In conclusion my impressions about her it was starting to change but I decide to talk with her to see what was happening, before that I start saying that she change and my impressions about her change. is bad to change the impressions about a person without knowing what is happening in their life,because you don't know if that person is waiting for you to ask them what is happening.

They also do not have much confident to speak with lots of people or give a speech in front of many people, which makes someone who attends an everyday class with a lot of people to be experienced than a person who takes an online class. people with much experience in a lot of things do not always have fake people in their lives.

People always think that taking an online class is very good, which is totally wrong. When taking online classes you do not get to know the people who are performing much better than you in class, but when you go to an everyday class in a school, you know the people who are better than you in different subjects. When you take an online class you do not get people who will help you solve your problems in much courses; for example, when you take an online class and you fail in a subject you would not know those who performed good in that subject, that means that you will not know how to study hard to perform good next time. Online students always find it difficult to study because, they do not see their mates in school learning which will also encourage them to that same thing. This means that taking an online classes will not be advisable for students.

Also when taking an online class, you do not get to interact with different kind of people through out the world. People who take an online class do not always have the confident to speak in public and do not always have lot of friends. Having friends is one of the important things in our life. When you have friends you share each others problems and solve it together. This means that when you take an online class you do not always have enough friends to speak to or to share your problems with. For instance,when you are given the opportunity to give a speech in front of a lot of people, you begin to shiver or start stammering because you are not use to speaking in public. but when a person who attends classes which involves a lot of individuals, they always have the confident not to only speak in front of their mates but to also speak to those who are much older than them without any fears.

Moreover, people who always involve themselves in a video conference do not always know the people their dealing with in their business or do not always have much idea about their business meeting. When one is present at work place all the time, he or she runs the business smoothly without any misunderstanding with anybody. Again when having a business with someone on a video conference, you do not know if the person you are dealing with is a fraud a fraud or not. So people who do an online businesses always end up putting themselves into trouble. When one is always present at their business places, they always know the people who are hard working and can make the business go much further and those who are lazy. When you are always at your work place,you make your members to respect and adopt your policies.

People who take online classes do not understand much better because, the teacher is not always around them when they need help with the topic that they not understand. But hen you are in an everyday school classes, when a teacher always teach and you do not understand you always know where to locate him to ask for help. Even when the teacher is not around, you can find different teachers who also teaches that subject and they will always find a solution to your problem. So students who attend an everyday classes perform much better than those who take an online classes.

All the above mentioned, which includes, it makes them interact with different people, find a lot of friends, get to know good people in a business, ask teachers for help when they have a problem really shows that taking an online class or a video conference is not really beneficial for an individual. Once all these measures are taken into consideration, people will see that going to an everyday class or making yourself present at a business meeting is more important to a person.",4.5,3.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0

Second, Some people like to make their own decisions and some poeple like to share their decisions with other people. But they have to tell their own story to the guidance, so they can get more experience and they learn more new information.

Third, the people who make their own decisions thinks the life its esay for them. No, not esay. They have to meet the people who has great level of decisions

First, the student have more freedom of concentrate in the home that school because student not have noisy peoples, student work more quickly and have interests in the class. The corporation a student of regular school and home student, in the regular school have lass time in the class and home have more time and focus in the class.

Second, some student cannot go to the school for problem in the health or is sick of a illness. Today al the peoples can student and learn for class online or video conferencing, student with problem can learn and study like other student from regular school.

Finally, other people have responsibility in the class like the job because some not have time for go to the school and work all the day and only have time after work in the night. The person can study all the night for online or video conferencing. The principal parts of the online is you can study any day or time.

in conclusion the student can take class for online or video conferencing in the home because today the technology have a good benefit in the peoples. student can study and learn in the home in any moment or day, have more concentration, focus, responsibility and the person have problem of health can study and learn of your home.

For example you gotta know how works all the processing, and people do not understand, so some time is very confuse. So in my opinion that first impressions, are very wrong because no everyone wants to be like different.

Secondly is very impossible to change because people do not have time to take care about that stuff. Also because they work they have boobies, shores, take care of their family so is very difficult to be part of that. But also people said that first impression is bad because is impossible to make right.

In addition, some people said that take a while to get used it because you need to be sure, to your goal come true. Also you have to work very hard, and if you do not have enough, time you not are able to get it so that mean, you have to work hard. Example like people said that impressions, are almost impossible to change well, for some reason it should be easy or hard we don't know.

In conclusion, I disagree because impressions, is not easy to take care too, many work in little of period of time so it will take me for ever to do it correct. But also people, said that is very hard and is total true so impressions are very hard to take care.     ",2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0
4A87CFC37238,"I believe that success comes from repeatedly failing but never losing interest on the task you're trying to accomplish. Trying to be successful in a certain task isn't something that can be done over night it requires extreme passion and patience, Certain scientist have been successful over time by failing but always getting back up on their feet and trying again hopefully to do things better. Scientist are driven by their enthusiasm over the life of science and what interesting things you could discover from studying it, their consistency of repeatedly failing and getting back up brought them a long way from nothing which eventually turned into something big for the society over time.

For example Christiano Ronaldo the world famous soccer player, Christiano worked very hard to become who he is now which is a world class famous soccer player. Becoming a pro soccer player isn't something that can be done over a couple weeks you have to work your way from the bottom you have to be extremely good to get into a club with years worth of practicing also comes with a lot of failure by not being able to do certain tricks, certain passes, or shots it's very difficult to perfect all those tricks or certain shots but that didn't stop Ronaldo from being the best. Soccer took multiple months of training and lots of failing and loosing matches for Ronaldo to get recognized after struggling and loosing Ronaldo eventually carried his team to multiple wins with tremendous skills, therefore soccer clubs came out to watch his games and soon he was offered a spot to play pro soccer, He worked his way up to becoming the best soccer player anyone has seen.

Most people in the world think failing is a bad thing and eventually give up after time, because of the lack of passion they have towards their task so tend to give up and move on with another task. The majority of our society are becoming more and more lazy over time which leads them push away all their work away for another time, therefore it's less of a chance for them to do bigger and better things in life like everyone wants. Some rappers, multi millionaires, and professional sports players became high school drop outs who worked at fast food places to get money to get through their day but they never gave up on what they loved the most regardless on how broke they were or how many problems they had they going on in their lives they never gave up on the thing they loved the most, they thought that one day they were gonna make it to the top and have a better life than they were living they never let go of that passion no matter how hard they had failed they always got back up and tried even harder than the last time.

Eventually, all that sweat and hard work they had put into what they were passionate about they got recognized more everyday which made them want to do much more in life, be better person from what they were yesterday. Anyone can be successful if they really put effort into what their passionate about no matter how many times you tend to fail as long as you're enthusiastic enough about your task to keep moving on and doing better.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0

We are graduating only once in our life, and to be able to graduate we must have an strong character that has confident, vision, and goals in life. The universe, destiny or even life won't share with us the opportunities that provides just for free, we have to move forward and challange our own person to dedicate every moment to taht goal we want to reach.

A graduation it's not a competition neither a race where only us will win because behind and in front of us there are million of other more people looking for what we are sacrifiying for. There are benefits that qualify to graduate before the traditional year and algo graduating at the right time. In three years you could acomplish what you wanted to do and go out and have more time to plan your life and what you want to do, however, completing the four years of high school will allow you to enjoy and experience more opportunities to do extra activities and spend that little time that you will never have. I agree in both options, I think we all choose the best for us, graduating before doesn't mean you are smarted neither that if you graduate in four years you are incapable.

4A9DB943D7D5,"My enjoyable educational activity I chose was soccer because it is a sport you do a lot of running. Soccer can be played all over the world. Long time ago people used to say that all sports were for men only but today men and women play sports thanks to the changing of the laws.

A day before a soccer game, players have to train so hard in order to win. They have to learn new tricks and they have to run a lot. All soccer players must have enough energy to run because it can lead to mistakes and can cause the team to lose. Soccer players need to be concentrating on the ball at all times and they have to make sure where they kick because if they kick too hard, they can hit someone in the stadium. During a game, there has been so many injuries due to running so fast and tripping players and then it causes a huge argument over the injured player. At all times if people want to be a soccer player, they have to play clean.

There are kids that want to grow up to be the best soccer player and for that they have to start early and join a team in a school or in other places that let kids play. Sometimes kids play at their house with siblings or other people in their family and that can be a good practice for a game in your team. Playing soccer is a great sport and it helps people lose weight because of the amount of running.

Some people play soccer for money because they got things to pay, others just play for fun. Some people say that soccer is just for Hispanics, but it isn't true because almost everyone plays soccer no matter the race. In soccer, it is best for your team to have a great coach and that he/she is good at teaching because sometimes its the coach's fault that they lose and he/she starts blaming everyone. Everyone has to try their best in any sport no matter what but its most important to concentrate on the sport and not be thinking about anything else but the sport because you can lose track and make your team lose and your team can be mad at you.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5
4ACFA2D3D0A1,"In my opinion I believe that it is better that we accomplish more it will make us more active. Im a firm believer that inactivity does not serve any purpose. This is the reason there is daylight and also nighttime; when its day time you get things done and when its nighttime you can rest or spend time relaxing. I also seen that the more you do the less you are to complain. Now let me explain to you some reasons why you should always accomplish a lot through out the day.

My first thing I would like to start with is that there was a study at ""The University of Florida"" it showed that a person that does completes lots of tasks usually does better academically. Also you can get stressed if your not doing lots of work suffer health issues being active is important. The university tested 40 students 20 of them would show up to class on time get assignments done and come everyday. They would also be inspired to do better with there studies.

It is also sometimes good to be inactive but that would mostly be during the night time when you have had a long days work you can sit down and just relax.

Being a active person also makes you a more preferable person when you are working. People tell you that you are a hard worker when they see that you are doing your work on time. You are also preforming to the best of your availability. At my work I had this conflict with my co worker and instead of me arguing I just told her she was right and let it go. This lady would always be angry because her work she would be stressed out and yelling but that again comes in with being a lazy person.

Being active can keep you out of trouble or addiction because you will not be so bored throughout your days. You will keep your head so busy that you will be so tired that you wont think about anything else just about taking rest and going home. Keeping bust is also a huge stress deliver because it makes your brain process things more quickly. Unlike with being inactive you just stay at home and do not do anything. Your brain will just be thinking all day about what it will do and you will get worried from not doing anything throughout the day. These are some of the reasons I believe it is good to be positive and not to be to worried.

It is always good to consider why the night time and the day time was made the sunlight was to keep us awake and then the dark was made to make us fall asleep. Also keep in mind that the time you spend doing nothing can be put for good use and you can never take back the minutes or hours that you have spent doing nothing. These are some of the reasons it is always good to be a active human being so that you do not have any problems later in life.                   ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0

''Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow''. Try to be better, and learn things that we don't know is the only way to grow. Trying new things to be better on things that we are already good. Having always family's motivation to keep going up, and for our learning proces. Learn from our mistakes, to grow as a person and never say never to anthing is a goog meaning of grow. For these reason i think we have to learn something beyond wath we have already mastered.

Trying new things to be better on things that we are already good, to grow. Meny people practise new different sports, to learn somethings new. take clases in the school, that we never taked to improve as a student. Have a different job, where we can improne our workers skills. For these reasons and many hothers i think try new things can help to grow and improve and what we have already mastered.

Having always family's motivation is the best support and our learning process. many people always try to think about this word ''family'' because, is the word that give averyone power to keep giong. Motivation to be learning, to help our familis is a big example of grow. Help others can have a big meaning end the others persons and for you too. For these reasons and many others i think having family's motivation is the best support and our learning process.

Keep learning from our mistakes, is the best way to grow as a person. When we try to learn something and so many times we make a lot of mistakes, that mean that something good is coming. Some people like to make correction to help, and that is one of the best wat to improve. Never say never, always keep going because that's way the mistakes exist, becuse we learn from them. For these reasons and any others, keep learning from out misrakes, is the best way to grow as a person.

In conclution, i am agree with Ralph Emerson Wrote. We have to try to do something beyond what we have already mastered. Trying new things to be better on things that we are already good. Having always family's motivation. Keep learning from our mistakes. This are many raison to be agree with Raph Waldo Emerson wrote and, if we want to grow we have to learn somethings new.",2.5,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.5
4E0094B179E0,"School is a time where you will receive assignments and it is your decision to complete them. Doing your work affects how teachers will think about you and how you will grow in the future. However there is one thing I disagree with in school. It is how the teachers praise students who aren't giving their best efforts. I believe that true self-esteem comes from achievement and it is not right to support those who aren't really trying.

The first reason I disagree with the teachers method to boost kids self-confidence is because they are too dependent on others. They will look for someone to always keep them up but in a world like this you can't depend on anybody. They can't always depend on someone to help them succeed. Students can become too attach and expect to always be praised by what little they do. What would happen if their was no one to support them. They would do nothing because their wouldn't be anyone to motivate them.

My second reason would be that they dont accomplish their achievements. When you accomplish a goal you have this feeling of happiness or relaxation. If students are always praised for their efforts they will never actually try to complete the task because they will have the feeling of completion. They have no reason to keep going if they seem to be done which could be a bad in the future. In the future they probably will fail their assignments because they believe that they have done good when they have but not good enough to complete it.

Their are some benefits on teachers motivating students such as them gaining confidence and self-esteem. It could really help people in the future. You motivating them could later cause them to motivate others in to doing their work. I just dont want teachers to go too far and praise them for writing their name,sometimes you have to be strict. It might hurt at first in the end it will all work out.

Those are some of the reasons of why I dont support teachers motivating students. Students should learn how to work alone and shouldn't ask for help. However i'm not discarding the option of teachers helping student. I'm just saying that they should only focus on what those who really need the help. Hopefully their will be change and teachers will only help those who actually try. ",4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0

These small acts of kindness could benefit the whole world, change it too. This could Create self reputation. Self reputation can be created a lot of different ways, but one kind and easy way is by being kind to others around you, this could help create or maintain relationships of any kind, another way this could benefit you is because sometimes other people will be nice to you in exchange this could impact you and others immensely, i know this from experience because sometimes i just give a simple short compliment to others and it lights up their day, and sometimes when i am feeling down and its noticeable, people are nice to me in exchange. This would make you more noticeable anywhere, people will know you as the kindest guy/girl around, so then people will ask you for a compliment or they will be nice to you.

This next way i will be talking about could really help out our community, or even the whole world. This could change the world because, the world we live in is pretty corrupted in many ways, but we could change that by being nice to others, for example if you are nice to someone they are going to feel happy so that person would want others to feel happy so he is kind to others, so it basically just loops, if more people are kind then the more people they will influence causing more people to be kind. This could give others the reputation they want, like being more noticeable, i know this because it happened to me, i had just decided to be kind to others around my school, and it made me more noticeable, causing other classmates to be nicer in order to be more noticeable, so everybody wins practically.

Lastly a really kind way to impact others with kindness is, you could make them feel better about themselves, like Aesop said, ""No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted."" Like complimenting someone could make their day, and this impacts them and others around that person because they noticed that someone had been nice to that person and had made their day too, because it's wholesome. You could change peoples lives, like it changed mine, i was usually around 11 years old, and i had some trouble at school and home, but the people that are my friends now, just made my whole year, maybe my whole life because i knew some of them were going to stay with me till the end.

52FEF34F4AC7,"Should students take online classes? Students can learn more by taking online classes? students have benefits for attend classes from home?.

On this paper I will argue about how students have benefits attend classes from home, and how improves skills for he future.

I think that students would have benefits for attend classes from home, because is a new opportunity for study more, and for improve more the skills more online classes for the future.

Teenagers that are attend classes from home I think will be more healthy, because that means that students will be more able to sleep , and will be have more time to rest the brain, and more time to do all the things at home, because a lot of students they do not sleep during the night the reason, because they work others that always talks with a friends and others that they use technology, and waking up at the early morning make the students brain tired, and makes the students do nothing at school for the rest of the day.

Students will be more organizing there time meaning that students will be able to have more time to have job, or do others activities during the day, or after taking classes online, because when they attend to school they do not manege very good the time they always doesn't care about time or do something important.

Students will be putting more attention to classes, because when teenagers attend to school most of the things that distract the students are the friends and the technology means that teenagers when are around friends distract the mind out of the class, and that causes that students don't pass the class, or the test, otherwise when are taking classes from home there is no body around that can distract and loss the attention of the students and will be more easy to do homework, projects, and study for test.

Some people say that the idea of students attend classes online from home will have more benefits is a bad idea, because they say,""Teenagers are lazy, and they will sleep more late at night"".

Students taken classes online will be more smart, because there will more practice skills for the future where will be benefits of know how classes are doing online, and they where taking.

On the future students will be able to attend classes from home, and will have benefits for skills, and this will make the teachers more easy to turn any work or practice any class that they missed, and that way students can have more ideas how will things will change and compare between attend to school and take classed online.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0

Most workers may ask that and will be furious with technology because of the fact that they will have less work and probably less hours of work, since technology is taking over their jobs. it could also be said that technology could be taking over some jobs that require less work, which could be bad for the job environment because that means less job opportunities for people.

First, it could be rude to the staff that work their because of less human communication. How is it rude? Well think of it like this: someone is better than you at your job and you wanna be better, but you cant because the person you're going up against is a computer and knows mostly anything and everything on what to do in those situations. Most people may have to face the fact that you can't do anything about technology.

Second, The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology will have negative effects on peoples lives because of the fact that technology will help most people in some cases, but most people wouldn't appreciate the help from technology because it could be taking over their jobs and have less human contact with others.

In conclusion, I believe with the reasons I have provided that technology will have a negative effect because of the way they're taking over most jobs and seeking happiness to people that enjoy it. People wouldn't like to admit the fact that technology is actually helping them and providing less work for them. Technology is actually seeking to steal most peoples jobs by doing their work for other people. I truly believe that the negative effect on technology is doing jobs for others that have the ability to do it . ",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0
53E542321463,"Dear Principal,

I agree with what you think but sometimes students need sport so that they can think better. I am in a sport and I wouldn't like to miss my sport. I believe students should keep playing sports but their grade average should go up at least to a B. I am worthy that students grades will go up.

Think about it's if the students are in sports because you nor their parents would want them out of the house to go with a group of bad people. so think about what I am telling you then write back. I hope you agree with what i am writing. Just think that you were a kid without sport and out in the street with those bad people.

There is so much about the ocean that we don't know about. About 5% of the ocean is discovered and our earth is made of 75% water and 25% land.

Marine biology is a job were you work with animals. there is so much you could do as a marine biologist. for example, you could swim with animals and collect data, you would work in a lab to find cures with animals, you could even not directly with animals but research about them.

The ocean is an amazing place and is full of magnificent creatures. i would love to swim with sea life and help them in any way i can. if i see an animals caught in a net. I would try and save it. If there were animals in a bad situation such as injured, harmed, caught. I would help it. so many animals are killed every year. either for clothes, food, wild fire, pollution, loss of habitat, etc. over 700,000 thousand animals are killed every year. that includes sea life and land life. So many animals that are endangered like the black rhino. the great white shark, etc just from poaching. sharks are hunted for their fins and then just tossed back into the ocean to die. same goes for the black rhino. they are hunted for there horns and then just left to die. i want to accomplish saving some animals when i grow up.

In the ocean coral reefs are dyeing because of people and habitat distraction. some people think that coral reefs are just rocks growing out of other rocks but they are actually animals and they are living and breathing just like us. maybe they dont have noses like us they are animals and they should be treated like animals. in ten years we would have lost 100% of our coral reefs. That doesnt mean that all the coral reefs are gone it means that there wouldnt be enough coral reefs are a good habitat. Animals need coral reefs to live in and hide from predators like bigger fish.

So many animals died from plastic just drifting in the ocean. there are more than 1 million plastic being dumped into the ocean each year. Sea life dies from plastic by getting stuck in it or eating since its not biodegradable. In the future i want to help sea life with all the plastic and at least help out with it. a lot of animals even get stuff and grow up with plastic stuck on them or in them. there is this turtle when it got caught in a tip tie. the tip tie was stuck around its shell and it couldnt get out so it just grew around it and deformed the shell. when helpers saw the turtle they took the zip tie off of the turtle and the the turtle was free but its shell was still deformed from the zip tie. when people are recycling they should at least up the bottle holders so if it does get in the sea and a animal finds it. it is less likely to get stuck in it. turtles eat jellyfish so when there is a plastic bag floating in the ocean. the turtle thinks its a jellyfish and eats it. after some time the turtle might die because it cant digest the plastic.

i want to accomplish visiting the ocean and go diving, snorkeling, touch wild life and help out with injured animals. ",3.5,3.0,4.5,4.0,3.5,3.0
558B9106B99B,"In my opinion student have no time to sleep because they want to stay up and study, or do their homework, Also parents start calling school why my child failed in class, Although student should decide, actually school should decide because have time to get work done, falling the class, and sleeping in class.

student should have time to go home and do their work, they should have time to study, Also they should have time to do their homework. If student know that they have homework to do he have to do it on time.

However they start failing the classes, they start failing by not turning their work on time, if they do turn in their work on time their grades will drop. They should start paying attention and turn in their work on time. some student also sleep in class, Being to tired may be the case, if student stay up late and doing their work they can't get up on time for school they will get sleep in class and they can't do their work on time.

Because of not having time to work, failing, and sleeping in class, school should decide. Student don't have enough time to study. Student grades start going down and then they will fail the class, school should decide what student should do to pass the class doing their work on time, and not sleeping on class. If school want to their student have good grade in class, no sleeping in class and passing the class. school have to make a new law for student, the law is no phone in class and no talking in class, because phone is the only thing that student can't study If they make this law then every student will get a good grade and they will pass their class. Sleeping on time is parents responsibility, not school Parent have to tell their child to do their homework on time sleep on time and get up from sleep on time, then student can be success and student will have good grades in classes.

Most of student that sleeping in class is student that they are working after school, and they are working until

10 or 11 in a night, and they can't get up early in the morning so they sleep are sleeping in class, they are not paying attention to their study, and their grades will drop, then they will fail the class.  ",2.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0

My teammates was in a bad attitudes try to cheer them up and I said ''at least we went though to the semi finals it was quite hard for us.'' Then my teammate was quite happy because going to the the finals is hard. That my experience how good attitude changed my teamates in diffcult times.

56F9E8427D97,"I raised by my grandparents and they always told me that curfew is curfew no matter what. To me, old people's advice are really important and efficient. Curfews keep teenagers out of trouble because individuals get home on time, chance to get saved by dangerous situations, and they can do something else at home. Some people think curfew is unfairly interfering their lives. For me, it is not because I have an experience that I should need a curfew.

First of, you can go outdoor and hang out with your friends, shopping in the mall, playing sports and doing some assignments from school work. Moreover, you should have to go home on time because some parents are waiting for their child to come back to home safe so, they can sleep in peace. In my experience, it happened long time ago. I went to my friend's birthday party and we were having fun. I knew that I break the curfew rule but I did not mind it as it was a big deal. After my friend's birthday party finished and everyone went to home including me. My friend's house was not far from my house, so I walked. I started realized that someone was following behind me.

Second of, teenagers whom are under 18 years old can be saved by dangerous situations if you follow the curfew rule. In example, what I heard from my friend was that she was outdoor and hanging out with her friends when her mother called her to come home early but she did not listen. She get home around 12 o'clock in the night chased by drunk male person. At that time, my friend's phone battery died and does not have any money with her. All she can do was ran and tears were coming out of her eyes that couldn't stop.

Third of, curfews might be different for every individuals but it is usually 10 p. m. If you come home at 10 p. m not breaking the curfew rule. You have lot of time that you can spend in your home including work on school work, watch interesting movies, read fantasy books, or you can do whatever you want to do at home. 4 years ago during winter break, Me and my grandmother went to a store to buy a handcream and it was dark and freezing outside. We were on the way to home, but one stranger black tall guy put a gun on my grandmother's head and we gave him the handbag and the wallet. We ended up crying and shocking.

Finally, all those things happened to me in the past. I learned a lesson which is listening people's advice is really important in your life because lot of teenagers are out of control in this ages which are 15-18. Taking things serious is not useless it is more powerful and useful in your life. Curfew is one of the warning that can take you straight to your home safely. Do not do anything wrong that can ruin your life. ",4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0
57B782277D2F,"Think about the benefits of working with a group or working alone and what do you feel is more beneficial? I think that working with a group is more beneficial because you can get things done quicker, share creative ideas, and it shows teamwork. It also saves up time when working in a group and when having deadlines.

First, working with a group gets things done quicker and you don't have to worry about much things when working with a group. When you have a group, they could be doing something else while you do another thing at the same time. However, having to do all that stuff by yourself slows you down and might not have time to finish. Your group and you are all doing something and that makes everything go quicker because your not doing it all by yourself. If you work alone you could be stressed and have to think of all the ideas. Working in a group can really bring more ideas to the stuff you and your group are working on. Also, you can divide the work with your group members and make things faster.

Second, sharing the ideas with your group can be helpful. It can also be very fun working with other people and having different opinions around. Someone in your group can be the most creative person and really help out on what you are working on. If you don't share your ideas then whats the point of being in the group. Everyone needs to have something to say and something to work on. If you work alone you will miss the opportunity to have someone helping you and have an opinion on it because when you present it, other people might something to say about it. Working alone can be frustrating and exhausting for some people because when they don't know something on one will be there to help them. Also, having to work alone might make you to multitask a lot and difficult for you to finish on what you are doing.

Last, shows teamwork and that teamwork makes everything better than having to work alone. When you show teamwork with your group it shows that all of you can be leaders in that group. Working in a group can be really fun because you be partnered up and meet new people or be with the same people you know and make the work effort exciting. When being in a group, you can your part while everyone else does theirs and it makes everything go quicker.

In conclusion, I would prefer working with a group than working alone because working with a group make things much easier and less work too. I wouldn't want to work alone because I wouldnt have anyone to discuss and share my opinions with. Having to do all that work by yourself can be very difficult in the process; things may not come out the way it should. Also, when you work alone you might not have many ideas to think of and with a group you can. Working by yourself may not be as much fun as in a group. If you had a group you would be able to divide the work, but working on something by yourself probably make it two times harder. That's why I think that working in a group is more beneficial than working all alone.",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0
5807D5F42CEB,"This is why employers should hire me. Employers should hire me because I can show hard work, really good hospitality, and good communication skills. These make a good employee.

First reason why employers should hire me is because I show hard work. Hard work is essential because the harder you work the more you get done, and that's really helpful. For example, if you're playing soccer and you are trying to score a goal, you can't just score it magically while just standing there doing nothing. You have to work hard to score the goal by running, passing, and communicating with your team. All of that relates to hard work.

Second reason why employers should hire me is because I show really great hospitality. This is really important because the more comfortable you can make the customer, the more they will enjoy the place and like it. For example if you're working at a hotel and a customer walks in, and right away you are not nice to them. They will start hating the place and they won't come back again. On the other hand if you're nice to them and make sure they enjoying their time. They will love the hotel and will always want to come back in the future.

Last reason why employers should hire me is because I show really good communication skills. This is yet another really important characteristic to have as an employee. The reason being is because if you can't communicate well with a customer, they will have a really time figuring out what they need to do. For example, if you are working at a shop and a customer walks in and asks you for a specific thing. Then you start to get nervous because you don't know what to say or how to act, then they will have a hard time trying to find that specific thing because you didn't know how to communicate.

These are the reasons of why employers should hire me. Employers should think of hiring me because I can show hard work, great hospitality, and good communication. And having these three characteristics makes an awesome employee. That's why employers should hire me.",4.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0
58E485E875D5,"Try your best' Many people say this sentence to people who have test or have thier own projects. Because trying the best you can, will make better result than doing nothing. Like this, always doing something can accomplish more. More you tried, better result will came out. Such as Edison and many people who live successful life in our society.

First, There will be many mistake while making a decision. But we need to keep thinking of it and find a way. Example, Edison, who made a light bulb, do you think did he make it without mistake? No, there are a lot of failed experiments and mistakes. But he didn't stop to make it. He did keep practicing and, figure out other way to success making the light bulb.

Second, in our society, there are a lot of people who accomplish more than other. Almost of them always did something like practice their experiment, find a way to figure out it, think about their purpose and each way to make it correct. Also they wanted to solve question of their problems. People can't be inactivity to do these. Doing a lot of work, and never to be idle, can accomplish more.

Third, some people can say 'There are people who didn't work that much but live successful life'. If there are? That people was really lucky. Almost of them, there is no one who accomplish more, with out any effort. Idle people do not focus on their project then, how can they make the result better? Example, someone who practice everyday and, work until late night will accomplish more than lazy one.

Lastly, try a lot of thing and keep doing something will make you grow. Sometimes inactivity can help you to rest and releax your selves but if we being more activity and always doing something, we can accomplish more. ",4.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5

Generic_Name has good grades he is always doing his school work, never dose anything to upset the teachers or get in terable while Generic_Name is the complet opposite.

Generic_Name has poor grades, always talking back to his teachers and never dose his school work he also get in to fights with other students. Generic_Name has a idea he wants to help Generic_Name to become a better person and influence him to do well in school. Generic_Name have the same first block class as Generic_Name. Generic_Name decided to get bad grades and talk back to his teachers.

Generic_Name is doing all of this because he wants Generic_Name to realize just because you have bad grades in school that dose not mean you can not change that.

For example, lets say your mate wants you to meet his or her parents, so to give them a good impression you would have to, have a good attitude tours everything they say in order to give a good impression to them. another example can be work, having a good attitude at work can be a lot less stressful and more positive in your life and others coworkers because your not complaining of how difficult your day was, they have it difficult too, but maybe not having so much stress in your mind or complaining how life is treats you, you can even hang out with your friends or your coworkers time to time and make new friends or people like you even little more because at the end of the day everything would still be the same so be more positive. So having a good attitude tours your friends, family or coworkers can lead to positive outcomes.",2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0
5ADD410B9783,"A student does not need to be success to be praised, an achievement doesn't always necessary to have a self-esteeming come from effort failure and motivation,

First, success is not the only thing that can make a student be praise.

It is their effort whats matters even though a student did not do well on hes work, but a least he tried to do it, may be he is good at it, but he is have been a hard time on his life at that time, if a teacher or someone said good job you did it well i am proud of you. He is gonna be happy of that someone understand him at his bad time, and support him.

Second, failure is where a student achieve, learn, and gained experience, e never going to achieve at something without fail. Example, my on experience i have been seem achieve, and things that i did not succeed on it, in my life i had failed many school test or not get the score what i want to me it a fail, but to others it not, i always get mad at myself if i do not succeed at any tiny gold. When my teachers or someone tells me something nice, Good or they are proud at my work i felt so my proud of myself i am so proud that i have peoples who can understand me and support me. One day a teacher said "" i'm proud to have as my student and to be your teacher you had showed me that no matter what where you came from you can achieve anything you want, also in how hard you have worked maybe your work is no that good, but i had seeing you work harder keep being like this do not gave up on your dream or what you are doing ""

she praised me with all her words made me cried , and to keep going believe in myself that i can do everything.

Third motivation and self- confident, is what makes the difference, and changes a student life.

being confident on what we are doing on our life or working on something even if we don't give our best at least we tried it, sometimes we achieve in something and we don't learned any new thing because we already know hoe it is done it, if a person praise someone it motivates them to keep going and and not give up on their dreams even if its hard and impossible self-esteem makes a person fight back.

Finally, self-esteemed won't be always be for achievement, an self-esteem will be always on a student who are willing to do what is hard not the easy thing even though, they don't succeed and or achieve they know who they are and what they are able to do, lowers standard is better then nothing.

some people may think achievement are required to praise while others think that is not, and for this reasons it doesn't be necessary to be success or achieve a gold to be praised by someone.                    ",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5

Generic_Name

INTRODUCTION:

Havent you ever thought of starting an after school homework club for students who are having difficulty in certain subjects?.

BIGININ:Well in certain states school barely have extra help for students for Example in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras and more states but in the united states is different they have extra programs the main thing is us the students they want a good education in my Generic_School we have an after school it's call Hornet 21 and in my opinion i think that having a program like that is awesome why you might be asking well here are some few reasons 1st of all you get to see on what the students need help 2nd of all you get to ask them on what they get stuck or don't understand. 3rd of all you get to meet you'r teacher and they get to meet you. there some students that are to shy to talk about it this will also help the teachers on where or what group they should them to work on what do they need work on? witch would be very helpful them and there teachers and the teachers might notices some changes or not. not every mistake can be change but you can start fresh again.

FIRST: it would also be helpful to see on what subject there really good and they are confident about it those teachers who help on everything like they know everything they move from one to another class room they could help those kind of students that get homework from different subjects for example like Math,Scients, Social studies. and the teachers could inform the students teacher on what there struggling and on what there all good on I mean you never know if those student's could be are next president or are next doctor, police.

this program is also nice because it helps students practice English not for all of them but for some of them yes this help me a lot.

MIDDLE: this program will also make the student proud of them self a little thing can change our world to be come better our country need programs like this programs that are going to success us programs that were going to be proud of this kind of programs have help a lot of students i know sens elementary school and not should middle school have it high school and elementary to and is also nice because some parents come late to work and the program would be finishing about 4:50 so there going to be fine when they get home so they can be home alone this after school activity would also get them prepare for there exams they could study and they would easy get an A or a B. END You could also do this to a student who doesn't want to do there work or nothing you can make them stay in after school and they can finish what they decided to not do and that might be a big lesson for them to learn you could also tell some of the students to spread the word to some of there friends so you could get more students everyday and if they stay Monday,Tuesday, Wednesday on Thursday and Friday they could have a free day you could have them do soccer basketball anything they want if they deserved it, you could also announced one day so the whole school would know about the program this could also be fun for the teachers not just for the students teachers to well that's what i think on a after school homework club. Base on this information I can say that schools do need this program Because it's really helpful for the student's. outside in the worlds there some kids who don't even know what school is because there working to feed there family. The community should do more programs like this so students get extra help. not all the county gets to have fun activities like us. and my opinion is yes it's good to have after school programs for schools and kids who care and that have a featured.",2.5,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0

First of all,

people became addictive playing video games, and they spend to much time on it. Video games take you out of contact with others. With the use of technology daily affect people's vision, with the time people use glasses.

Secondly, people became antisocial with the use of technology because, people prefer to spend their time on the internet than having a conversations with their friends. People use to have communication with others by the technology instead of hangout or doing any activities with them. The majority of the people prefer to shop online, and lost their time thinking if the clothes is going to fit them, instead of go to the store, try the clothes on and see if is a good idea to spend the money.

Finally, the use of the technology is less helpful and have a negative effect on people's lives because, the technology take people out from the real world, for example if people shop online and they have questions they have to wait to long to get their answers, but if they were at the store a worker would help them. The use of the technology affect the communication with other people.

In conclusion, technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others and it can be faster; however, the use of the technology affects people's lives, and the communication between two o more person.

Example: If your attitude is bein positive, and you are being nice with tha person his going to be nice also, and yuo would have more posibility to get it.

Students could just not answer the video calls. Students could just simply also not keep up with the work due to improper communication.

Students could easily be distracted in video conferences with other things. Things that could help them not attend to the conference that is going on. As for classes that are taking place online, Students could just not be doing the work and be on other pages.

It can be easy to not attend any of these classes, you could just not show up, do the work , or simply just sleep in. If you dont attend these classes it could lead to serious consequences. These consequences could lead to serious things. It would be better to have a physical class to walk into and attend.

Some students are better learners when you directly speak to someone one on one. Not all Students learn the same, some learn by being up and active such as athletes, mechanics, and others. Students that choose to learn online could also not understand a subject and could end up needing a little more help. Like me, I

need a little more help sometimes from teachers so I need a physical class and physical person to help me.

So in conclusion, I think it would not be a good idea to have students taught at home because of the distractions, Attendance, and miss communication. Therefore it would be better for a student to learn in a classroom with a Teacher that could help the student if he ever needs the help.",3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

Let's say I want to see other dementions' worlds', or go back in time. Lets say I build a machine to be able to do that. Cleaning the house, Cooking a meal, and doing homework. If we are always doing, then we can accomplish. We accomplish more by doing something. If we didn't we wouldn't have the things we do now. We can accomplish things' as a team or individually. Like sports, in sports people work together to win. A game company, these people work together to make a game, so that people can play it. In a game people play together online to win as a team or individually. It's better if we do our work, homework, or even little things like play outside, hangout.

Inactivity in it's own way has a purpose resting or sleeping, relaxing. If you do that you let out that steam. We take a break after working hard on something. So we do what we have to do for a couple of hours, we go home, we can take a nap, eat, watch a bit of tv, or sleep. That way the next day you can be motivated to continue doing your job, or go to school. If we do even a little during the day we've accomplished like go out and buy groceries, clean the house, and cook. If you do that then you've accomplished something. you can't really do anything if you sleep all day. Being lazy is not good.

I feel strongly that I dont like work alone because its very boring and takes long time to finish work. However, I do like to work with a group because its so much fun and you will experience with others and its more easy to do something.

First, Working with a group is so much fun especially when you are do something with your best friends. When you are work with your friends they makes you laugh so hard and we do lot of fun things togethor. Some of my friends actually works well with other people. When I have a free time I like to play games with my friends. In the game you will team up with your friends and play against another team. You have to talk to your friends every single time and lesson to their idea to win game. Most of video games needs to be really good team work. You can't do anything by yourself.

Second, When you are working with a group you will interaction and feel the other people. Its like social experience. Talk to your team-mates, lesson and support their idea. Working a group is way better than working by yourself. If you are learning English by yourself its very hard but if you had a teacher then its much easy to learn and quickly

Finally, You can do things very quickly because there is a more than one person working. If your mom say's clean your house. You have to clean entire house by yourself and it takes long time to finish but if you clean with your brother or sister then its quite faster than clean by yourself.

5F8195FBA0CA,"Imagine schools use cell phones in classrooms for educational purposes, students will not have a hard time to find information on their classes. Schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classroom, this rule is important because cell phones are the distraction, students will have an opportunity to cheat on the test or the exam, and cell phones will cause the laziness, lack of knowlegde, and procrastination to students.

Certainly, some people think cell phones should be allowed in classroom because students can have a cell phones' break after finishing their test, they can enjoy some entertainments on the cell phones, some students will focus more on education with the musics on their cell phones. Others believe cell phones should be allowed in classroom because students can easily work on the projects, they can search for more information that they do not know much about. Still others argue cell phones should be allowed in classrooms because they will help some foreign students with the dictionary apps on the cell phones. Cell phones also help students in classrooms such as: reviewing notes by playing kahoot, some games' apps which include school knowlegdes.

However, schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classrooms because they are creating an opportuniy for students to cheat on the test or the exam. Students will definitely use the cell phones during the test in classroom if cell phones are allowed. For example, students usually take pictures of the answers and send them to the other students. The second reason of why they cheat is because everything can be easily saved and taken on the little smart cell phones, so why do students have to spend a hard time to study for the test ? They can just easily write down information on their test from the little smart cell phones, so what is the point of education? This rule is definitely unaccepted.

Furthermore, schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classrooms because the cell phones are the huge distraction. Imagine everybody is sitting quietly in classroom, and suddenly the little noise is popped up from the cell phone, catches a thousand of people's views. Of course no one likes being distracted but having the cell phones during classes is the huge mistake that causes the bad things to everybody around. For example, some students always play some unappropriate songs very loud while everybody else is taking the test, this situation always happens in every school. The second reason is the person who is with a cell phone, can attract the other one who sits beside, and interrupt other students' business.

Finally, schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classroom because they will cause the laziness, lack of knowlege, and procrastination to students. Students will keep messing on their cell phones, and ignoring the education, causing the lack of knowledge. Students will not absorb enough knowledge into their brain because they can just easily search for information on their cell phone without thinking critically of what they are doing. They can have the good results but actually they have nothing in their brain from school. The more schools allow students to use cell phones, the more they are worsening their students.

Cell phones should not be allowed for students to use in classrooms because cell phones are the huge distraction in classrooms, even in other public places, students will have an opportunity to cheat on the test or the exam using the cell phones, and cell phones will cause the laziness, lack of knowlegde, and procrastination to students. If the cell phones are allowed in every school, students will not need to go for education because everything is available to use on cell phones. Schools only need the real hard working, and the real quality from students, not from websites on cell phones. Every school should always have to think critically about the effects of allowing students to use cell phones in classrooms.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.5

I'm agree with the statement about the importance to have a positive attitude in life, because that's one point at favor that can helps us for work hard everyday and give the best that we can do and had a success in everything we can make and do in life. However, depend on people,how much they want have success in their life and if they're a positive people for work hard and have what they want in their life and give a better life to their next generation.

Success in life is not just to talk about the everything is going to be easy for us,but it the depend how the people think and how much they want to have succesful life,somethings you're going to feel the everythings is hard and not the way the you think but you keep faighting because you have one reason why you work that hard for give to their family a better economic and education, when we talk about a better economic and education we're talking about to proper a better future for ours sons and daugheters for one day they can have everything and don't be worry about to work for have money for collage or university that one reason why people have a positive attitude and want to have a succesful in their life.

Positive attitude, Change they way of people think, for example my father is man who don't have a good education but he has a positive attitude and the way he works hard for give to my family the best he can take is super wonderful, because he is showing me the when you want something you have to work super hard and put on your mind the you can do anything you want and depend if you like to do it, he is always tell me a goods advice and giving me a big lesson the i have to learn in life for have a better future.

Another point the affect so much today in day is the way the people think ,depend so much how you look the things and think about it if you can really make or some people they fast get desolution when something do not work for they and the way they wanna, but everything depend how that person works and how much love him or her put for get a good result, but thats not the end of everything, people have many change and tryies in life, is something doesn't work for you have to let go and look for another change and you need to have in your mind a positive attitude the you can make or do doesn't matter how many times you try for get that job the you like or the car the you wish with all your haerth of the house of dream, everuthing depend how hard you work and how much you faight how have the things the you wish to have in your life and everything have a one reason why you work hard in your life.

In my conclusion have a positive attitude is very important for have a succesful life and that helps people to have a vision why and why you work hard everyday of their life and show the importance the you need to have it and the controls of your mind and the power of make or do what you want to have in your life. doesn't matter how hard was for get there but one day you're gonna see and say i make all these when you finally are there you going to see the everything hads one reason why you do all those stuff and you're gonna be happy and thats one thing of many reason why we need to have a positive attitude in our life.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0

Just because you have mastered something it does not mean that you cant do anything beyond what you have mastered. Having to master something can be a very big accomplishment to people including myself. Mastering one thing is good but mastering more than one thing is a huge accomplishment. Everyone can go beyond what they have mastered you just have to try and never give up and you will have mastered anything you want. Mastering something takes time and dedication its not just something you can do over night. It might take days, months, years who knows how long but at the end pretty sure it will be worth it.

There are many things people can be mastered at such as teaching, playing football, etc. Just because you have mastered one thing it does not mean that you should be done mastering other things beyond what you already have mastered. If i were a NFL superstar it does not mean i cant go to school and become a doctor also when you retire you would have something to do. Thats an example of what you do to go beyond what you have mastered. Some people are born with skills and for them all they have to do is fully master it. Mastering is a skill that allows you to personally get a hang of what your best interest are. If you want to master something there a variety of ways to do so such as go to college or a camp etc.

Mastering something is not very easy it takes time and dedication thats why doctors take approximately 12 years to get the highest degree in becoming a doctor. I strongly agree with author Ralph Waldo Emerson cause if you dont master beyond your intentions you will not grow. This is true because there are many things to do in this world to not be mastered at only one thing. What it means by you will never grow up is because you will stay at the same level Intel you unlock your full potential. This is a great quote for someone who was trying to master one thing in there life but after reading this quote it will help them realize that they can master more than one thing.

This is a example on if you become a master at one thing and get lazy you will never grow up cause you have only mastered one thing in your life. Life it self is a precious gift and special skills are to so take advantage of it and learn as much as possible. So if you go above and beyond what you have mastered you will be a good and grown person. Its good in life to be good at just more than one thing cause it will help you in many ways such as getting jobs or getting in to schools.

Where is one place you would like to visit?

I would like to visit Florida because they have really nice weather.

Florida is something special to me because I have family in Florida.

The place I would visit is my grandfather grave because my grandfather had died last year

To, begin The reason why I picked Florida is because I have really nice, cool family in Florida.

My grandfather had dies last year after he had fell and hit his head on the ground.

He is special to me because if it was'nt for him I would not be playing soccer right now.

Every time I score a goal i always do a celebration for him.

I have something valuable of his and that is the gold chain that I got on now that he gave me and I had never took the chain ever since he gave it to me.

I will take off this chain the day I die.

I had promised him that I will love soccer forever and go to college to play soccer.

The college that I'm going to is Generic_School.

The reason why I would like to go to this college is because I had went there for a scholarship and I had got the scholarship and they said that I am really good for my age.

Here go some tips if your not good at soccer you should go outside and practice makes perfect.

If your not good at it you should try I mean it is really not a hard sport if you think about it.

If someone say that you suck let them keep on telling you that for me I will take that as motivation.

The reason why I love soccer so much is because of my grandfather he loved soccer just like me.

Everytime I had went to Florida to go visit family me and my grandfather we would always watch soccer games and tell me some formation to play when I grow up.

The favorite things that my grandfather love to do was drawing, playing soccer and teach me some new moves.

Every morning we would wake up he will always take me and my brother to waffle house and we would tell some stories to me and my brother about what he did when he was growing up.

When he had fell and went to the hospital I was not but when my mom face time my aunt he found out that we could not move body shoulders down and then he had to get some brain surgies and all that then the week after all that he had died and we face timed my aunt and he prayed on the phone and we all was crying.

I had a soccer game the day after he died and I had scored 6 goals and every time I had scored I had always kissed my hand and point it up to the sky.

After the game I was crying because I was proud of my self that I played a game with all that stress over my shoulders and I said to my self I did that for my grandfather.

Then right after the game my mom had came to me and started crying because I told her that I was going to score 6 goals just for my grandfather and I did what I said I was going to do.

That night I was praying and telling my grandfather that I had scored 6 goals just for him and I was saying to my head that I was going to do that more often.

My next soccer game I had scored 5 goals but every time I go on the pitch I had always kissed my chain and touched the ground and point at the sky and I still do that today.

My soccer game in 2 more weeks and I am going to do what I need to do to take my team to the championship and I will play all my soccer games just for my grandfather.

All the soccer games I play they will always be for my grandfather and he will never forget that and if I have to do anything just to get some goals I will then just for him.

When I was in Florida my grandfather had bought me a soccer poster and a soccer jersey of my favorite soccer player.

He had got a jersey customize for that say my last name and my favorite which is number 7 and that is my favorite soccer player number to.

When I was little he had always send me some of his drawing and like always write a little back that say I will always love u miyo and miyo mean son.

When I was 10 years old he came down here to Virginia and he was visiting and he will always wake up at 4 o clock in the morning to go fora bike ride and when he came back he had always fix breakfast for us.

In the afternoon he will always 1 v 1 me or my brother in soccer for some money like 10 dollars but that is if we beat him do.

This why I play soccer just because of him.

Like when I get frustrated in the soccer game I will always take a deep breath and think about my grandfather and that is what always calm me down when I get frustrated.

He had always tell me if someone is talking trash always smile because that dont talk the most is the most strong ones in the game and I always tell them look at the score board.

Here go the reason why I would like to go to Florida:

Family and my grandfather grave.

I would like to go to Generic_City studios.

Go to the beach and get some nice weather.

In conclusion, Where is one place you will like to visit?

I would like to visit Florida because Florida have nice weather.

Florida is something special to me because I have family down in Florida.

The place I would like to visit is my grandfather grave. Another place I would like to visit is Generic_City studios because like your like in a movie because there are people that are dressed up as some characters.

Another place I would like to visit is the indoor soccer field and play some soccer there with some family and maybe some new friends if I meet some there.   ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5

For example, That is one of the problem that happen on many schools cause let's say when teacher tryed to explain us something about the intimate section they star to Idle when this is no funny. Also Thomas Jefferson inspire peopler to help others when they was idle to a inoccent people.

Additionaly we can stop the kind of problem if we work together helping each other.

It's wonderful if peolpe work as a community and tryed to help other,cause Thomas Jefferson was a men who like to help people on what he can. When someone else was Idle to you don't put attention and keep figthing on what you want .Like everyone know we have different talens and always one person of them was jealousy and tryed to Idle you cause he don't want you or someone else progress more them he that unfair everyone have different dreams and work hard vfor what they want.

On my opinion wse can work as a group and tryed to stop those peolpe who Idle others. Also we can do something else cause lety's said if vsomeone Idle otyhers and we bdon't help these guys the problem continued and repeat cuade anyone work with the kind of problem.

every time you failure more and more ,every time you learn something new , for example :

my mom always puts me to clean the house but every time i went to do the cleaning, she used to say ""you din't clean here or ""you are missing a part of the floor that still is dirty"" so i just say to my self next time i'm gonna clean better in this part of the room and i keep smiling not given up.

To learn how to clean the house in a perfect way i decided to clean the house every Saturday so i can practice more , it passed two month and then i went to clean again and i mop the floor , clean the windows , clean all the tables,so i finished and my mom says great job you now know how to clean in a perfect way!!.

62196AC0ABE8,"The British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote you your character will be what you yourself choose. In my opinion we choose our own character, and how we respect other people teachers, and students. My mom teach me how to behavior but she do not choose my own character, nonetheless some peoples make us strong but they don't choose own character, but on the other hand sometimes we need to change our character for example, my English teacher have a beautiful character but apart from that, sometime she need to changes her character because the students do not put attention in the classroom, and she have to be rude that way they stop talking and distract the other students, but however she never change her beautiful character.

The first step that I say that nobody choose our own character is because when we are sad nobody can change our attitude or own character somebody can try to help us but they don't gonna change our attitude because when we are sad sometimes we are angry, and our character is so bad that we don't want to do anything we just want to be alone or we just need to take a brake because maybe we are stress. My mom teach my how to behavior and that I have to respect the older peoples but she don't choose how my character it gonna be

In other words some peoples make us strong like my mom she teach me how to be strong too, and some peoples teach you that how to be strong but they don't choose how we gonna be how we gonna act, they can't teach us or change us our character we are the only person who decided If we need to change our character, however sometimes we need to change our character and that is gonna help us in the school in the house and in the life, and a person who is very respectful nice and have a good character is very important because what happened if you are angry have a bad character in the work nobody is gonna like to work with you the same happened in the school, if we have a bad character nobody is want to work with us that why sometimes is very important to change our character

The last reason but not the less important is without a doubt sometimes is important to changes our character like for example, my English teacher have some students that they don't care about the class, and she need to change her character in the class so that way the students stop talking and distracting the class, and when she change is character they stop to talk because she put angry and rude, but however she never change her character she always are happy she only change the character when the students are talking or playing in the class but they don't change the teacher character she change her own character

Nobody can change our character we decides if we change or not, sometimes it is important to make some changes to be a better person, and to help our self or to help other people, a person with a good attitude and with a good character always is gonna be good work with them we need to know when we need to change, and why we need to change and that is gonna help us for the life and for everything and always it is important to smile.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5
62654020C48D,"Are you one of the students that is home schooled? If not, here are some of the benefits, why some students choose to attend classes in their home, by the way of online or video conferencing.

Some people believe students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home, however, home school is a great way of student to attend classes because they can focus in their studies, it's more safer, and they can avoid bad influence from others.

Attending classes through online or video conferencing has a lot of benefits like what I mention from the first paragraph, that homeschooling can help students to focus in their studies. For some reasons, some students that go to school can't be focused on their studies/activities because they are distracted by some of their classmate that is very naught. For instance, there are some people that born in this world that are very naught, like even you defy him/her they will not listen to you and then sometimes, some of the other students will raise their pride and just walkout from their class because they don't want to listen any objection from their action. Another reason for home schooling is that, it's more safer for them to study. For example in today's society, a lots of bad things happening in the world, like school shootings that cause a lot of innocent students to die, like what happened in Florida, a few months ago. One of the reason also of homeschooling is that, they can avoid bad influence from others. Like for example, some of the school are diverse ethnic, students characteristics are diverse also, like some of the other likes to go shopping mall, likes to strolling anywhere, likes to bully others, likes to fight, likes to not go home after school instead go to other houses that they don't really even that much know, and many more characteristics.

Although students will have benefits of attending classes from school, however, attending classes from home has much more benefits. Attending classes from home by the way of online or video conferencing can really benefit to the students because one of the biggest benefits is that, they are more safer to study in their homes, they have a great time to focus in their studies, and they can avoid bad influence from others.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5
62EDBC22A953,"I think that success, are composed by failures, but not for everyone.

Success are for a better life, but to have a better life there will be always complicated things(FAILURES), that may be you will want to stop doing that thing that is going to help you to succeed.

The important role of failures on success is that, if you don't fail once you will not learn; failures plays that important part in success, learn is based on what you did wrong, I am saying based on wrong because If you did something wrong before, you learn that part, What do you did wrong? and next in the future you already know what you did wrong and now you will make it right.

Now, sometimes we give up so easy on what we want or on what we are fighting for, some loss the enthusiasm for the success and others not, I agree with that, some think different and if you think different about the failures its going to help you to make that success. I'll say, once my aunt told me ""Believe in what you can do, and not in what you can fail on"", she hasn't never give up on what she can achieve in her life. For example I'm from Generic_City and all my family are Hispanic and our home language is Spanish, and speaking English its not easy for me, but I never thought that I was going to be able to speak it. I told myself that everything its possible in life, you born for a purpose, not just because your mom wanted you to be born.

There was a time, I got stress, anxiety and depression. I was failing in school and I felt so sick that I was giving up so easy and fast. Failures comes one after one, and after one, that I told myself ""You are going to be okay, and you are going to do what you like and succeed and make your parents feel proud of you"". I started to think positive, and do the things right, nothing last forever, I got rid of my depression but still with stress and anxiety, but from there to now it doesn't mean nothing for me. Failures can cause a lot of things like, feel hopeless, loss enthusiasm and giving up so easy for those who are weak, but if you are strong enough to believe that you are going to make it you will make it, you are going to have your levels of hope, enthusiasm and faith high that nothing will stop you to succeed.

Failures are more challenges added to your life, to be in the top of the mountain you should hike until you can see the ocean behind the mountain. There will be more than failures, there will be big obstacles and some times people will put traps in your path.

Some people will just want to see you fail in the field and some will be happy to see you in the top of the mountain. Some people fails in their path because they dont understand the meaning of the failures.

In conclusion, I agree with the idea that Success consist of going from failure to failure, even if you loss your hopes or enthusiasm you got to keep going in your goal to succeed.

More than 50% of people, I will guess, fight for their future they put all their effort to succeed and if they can, we can. Failures come as a good parts of success to set it down and success in life.",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

631F9CBDFD7A,"Would doing school work at home benifit you? Working from home would benifit me because I can take breaks whenever I need to, as some students like work on the computers, and may see their family.

First, when working from home I can take breaks so I don't get stressed or angry. Some students need time to finish their assignments and not be counted as late. Students possibly have late assigments because they get stressed during school hours and they don't want to do it at home. However, if they work from home, they can complete those assignments at anytime and still get a 100%.

In addition, some students like to work on the computers better than on paper. For example: I like working on the computers because I like to multitask, so in this case I prefer working on the computers more then on paper. Mulltitasking is better for me because I like to listen to music and do some homework. Multitasking is a skill and not everyone has it.

Lastly, some students don't want to leave their family and prefer to be at home. For example: I have a sister that can't leave my mom, and I bet that she prefers doing school work from home. Personaly I prefer working from home and not leave my family. However, we do need to leave them at least when we're 20-21 or sooner. Working from home would benifit me because I get to be on the couch and not be sitting under the desk. I do like the confert at my house better then in public scools.

We choose to help others so then they can help others and we can show the world to be better.

Beginning,with this statement i agree because, when we were young little kids we would always imagine that was our big thing like, as an other parent would probably say to your child "" your child has a big imagination "". And imagination will always be apart of us we grew up having our little or big imagination's how do you think we would imagine us in the future or like some other examples: how we want to wear out clothes, what type of clothes we wanna wear, what design we want on our cake, or and how we imagine unicorns, ninjas,or any of those type of things ,and superheros. without imagination we wouldnt know about that or the sense of knowing what that is.

Also,

having imagination is also good because were not always gonna use our knowledge like for disable people not all of them have knowledge or even know what that is,for one example blind people yeah they have knowledge but also in there life they use there imagination throughout a blind person's life imagination is something they will use in there life spam and you wanna know why how do you think blind people know what a teacher is talking about or how they are drawing it blind people use there imagination they use it so they can understand what the teacher is doing or when there walking down the street or when buying clothes,There number one thing there gonna always use is imagination knowledge might also help because you have some information about it or do they just magically know what there doing no they imagine it,or they imagine were this thing is or that thing.

It might be a life changing for me to see how they live there maybe i might start being greatful for what i have and they dont and i would start helping others mor often.

One reason i would go to portorico is to see how they do stuff different like what they wear,what they eat, and what they do on daly it would be intersting seeing all that and i would like to try new food and wear the cloths they wear and try to see how it feels to be a portorican.

Another reason i would love to go to portorico is because at the USA i am not greatful for what i have and maybe if if i go over to portorico i will be greatful for what i have because i will see the difference of how i live and how they live it will also melt my heart to see them eating unhealth and i am over here throwing my food away because i dont want it.

My final reason for wanting to go to portorico is because i will want to see how their parents are with the kids like when they get in trouble. I also want to see how teachers are with their students when they get in trouble because i want to see if they are different than El Salvador cause there they hit their students with the ruler and that is not okay.

Do you agree with the Former Prime Minister Of England Winston Churchill quote? There others take this quote in a positive way or in a negative way. People that have enthusiasm will most likely to take the quote to their own hearts that doesn't want to quit or gives up yet. Like the quote says from failure to failure that will follow up to a pursuit of success. So here comes the reasons of enthusiasm in the quote.

Learning something new that actually comes up great. A lot of people learn from their own failures in the past for doing something that wasn't easy for their own lives. Like example someone wants to speak a different language but failed many times,that actually doesn't wants to give up on the language that trying to learn. And it's better to make mistakes for something greater later in life. Like if you failed a lot and that you learn from your own mistakes from those mistakes will do something greater in the future.

Others may disagree that quote doesn't fit right their own selves and for being negative. Others careless about the enthusiasm how it will help for their lifetime. So they don't have the positive attitude and thinks about nothing at all. Negativity is the main point that they fail to fail without trying the best and the enthusiasm with them in life it's worthless to them in life.

Although some people don't agree with this quote for being negative,however others and I agree of the enthusiasm quote because to learn something new in life and to make mistakes for something great later.

655BD307F87D,"Many students in high school are looking for the way to reduce their time in school, there are several reason for students to think about it. These students might be passing through hard situatons, such as: economical crisis, issues at home, need of independence or any other problems that is not allowing them to be in school the time they should be in, but some people do not need a short period in high school because of they are struggling, this group of people might want go to college earlier or get a job as soon as possible for personal reason.

In the United States, we live everyday a situation call ""migration"", this type of situation make people to leave their countries for some valid reason, regardless the issues they will have coming into the country. In fact many of this people is looking a better life here, the life they could not have in their countries because of their governments, scarcity of resources, scarcity of jobs, low wages, dangerous areas and many others situations that nobody would like to live. Between this group of people we can find students that were in school in their countries, but when they come into this country and they get in high school, as a result of the ""bad"" education from certain countries, these students are settled in grades where they should not be because of their age and learning capacity. This is one of the main reasons why high schools and the departament of education should have programs where this group of students can find better opportunities of learning without changing the time they should be in school.

In another point of view, for school districs to offer this type of programs, the country will get benefits because of the students will get in college earlier and we are going to get a lot of professional people that can help to improve our nation.

Economy will be a good reason to want get out of high school one year early, this is because many people do not count with the amount of money that is needed to go to college, many students prefer to work to make money for their payments instead of getting financial help from the bank that they will have to pay with higher interest in the future. Other students think about the possibility to go to college out of the country because of the high cost of them, but they still have to work and get extra money.

The departament of education of the United States is encharge for all these changes and they should take this option because it would benefit people, would benefit the country, and will benefit students in general.

The program could work if students stay after school or they come at night, this would give them more opportunities to make a plan where they can work hard to reduce their time in high school, it is really important to keep on mind that many students already work in their free time and they might not be able to do an extra time in high school, that is why this offer should be analyzed in order to the student benefit, but at the same time giving the enough amount of knowledge they will need.",4.0,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.0
65975436BE5C,"True self-esteem dose come from praising someone to keep going and to follow their dream. Like a good friend once said ""never let anyone put you down always get right back up on your feet"". This is saying that people should believe in their self more than what other people say about them that will drag them down. People need to have thick skin to block all the negative haters and disbelievers because having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.

First, people need to be confident in their self in order to fallow what they want to achieve in life. For example, I was not confident on passing the SOL and my teacher was praising me to be positive and not to over think it. Then it came to the SOL, and when I finished it, the next day my teacher told me that I had passed. She later then told me that I should believe in my self more. This show that when someone praises another person that they will have confidants in their self.

Second, courage can be helpful in over coming fears that can drag one self down. For example, when running a relay race and you start to fall behind. People end up giving up and saying in their head I lost there is no way to catch up because Im all ready in last place. People will want a friend to cheer them up and encourage them not to quit and to keep fighting. From the courage that is given to them then they will keep running till the finish line. This shows that courage can praise someone to keep going.

Finally, many young teens should trust what adults say to them and not ignore them. However, some may say that teens can do what ever they want, they are wrong because teens need to be taught life lessons. For example, when I was younger I steal from stores with a couple of friends. My mother told me not to hang out with other teens that will cause trouble. Which I didnt listen to her and we got caught by the workers and they called our parents to come pay for the belongings we stole. This shows that by praise from adults, teens will make good choices that wont get them punished.

In conclusion, praises can be very helpful for a person to feel good about their self. When taking any kind of test people will want to be successful. To when having to play in a sport people will want to win and not quit. Also to listen to people that are there for others no matter what. This shows that having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.",4.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0
65B1F548E8BE,"As teen mature, they make opinions about issues that can affect them. Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think students should not be benefit to attent classes from home.

Students would not be able to socialize with other students. For example, staying home every single day and not going out can lead you to depression. I personnel can't stay home all day and only focus on school. Also, teenagers need to interact with people more often and not be home all day. In conclusion, students need to get out of their home to clear their mind about all the work the school gives them.

Students would not be responsible in the future. For example, when they grow up they will not have the knowledge and the resposability it take to get a job out side of home. Students would not know all the resposabilities it takes to wake up every single day in the morning to go to school and do all the work that is required to do to be able to graduate. In other word, it will affect them not knowing how hard it's to work hard for something they never force them self to do. In conclusion, teenagers should get the experience and the hard work it take to be successful in life at a young age.

While some people believe that students should not be benefit to attend classes from home, others argue that students should be benefit to attend classes from home because they can do their work on their own pace. Althought this might be valid,There is several ideas to considered such as, Students would not be able to experience of being part of a club or sport in school. For example, Schools have many activies that can be helpful for students futher in life. Students will not know how it feel to be part of a team or how to work as a team. Also, In the furure sometimes they will be required to work with a group of people but they will not be comfortable because they never had that experience. In conclusion, Students wouldn't be able to do any activies in school.

Students shouldn't be allow to take classes at home while other student's go to school. First, Students will be isolated in their home all the time. Secondly, They will not know the hard work they need to put in to achieve something. Finally, Students wouldn't be able to enjoy the life of a teenager.

Some people said that technology is good because they can do many thinks, like find books, information and do works more easy. Other people thinks differents, they said that technology is bad because had negative effects on people life, if people do not know how to use it, they can will have problems because sometimes people send archivements or informations to the wrong person or publish it. I think that technology is bad because with technology we can do many thinks, but some people use technology for hacks, steal acounts and cheat persons.

First, some people said that the technology is important in this era, because is more easy to do many thinks,

for example, search specific information more fast.

To do homeworks or company works with more information and explanations make projects, glide planes or to find books and work without think a lot.

Second,the technology is very important to some people, because many times they used it to do they works and make some project, the technology in this era provoked many wrong thinks, it created many electronic thinks that are advanced. Then, the purpose of use technology if for good reasons and with the technology always people will have easy infornation but they wil not learn the technology caused that people lose their time playing videos games and visiting wrongs wed site. However, the technology caused many problems, the people are using the electronic thinks a lot, the cellphone, video games etc. It are creating a obsession in the people, many kids and adolocents have problems with they vision, because pass a lot of time in the cell phone, computer or playing videos games causing cancer, tumor or lose their vision.

Finally, the obsession that technology are creating is very worrying, many kids don't do the homeworks, the students text in class and do not put attention, other persons driving texting causing accidents. Some parents permit that they kids use technology, but they do not have the contol of them the adolecents use technology for have fun sometimes causing problems. Today in this era the technology are advancing and provoking that people do not learn and sometimes it cause the death, persons use technology sometimes to hacks acounts and steal informations, photos or they publish inappropriate photos in they acounts causing bullyng or making the person feels bad. Also, the technology is very advance that the people are creating robot to make more easy the works, but is is a ploblem because the robot will be remove the people jobs, causing that the people leaving whithout job.

In my opinion students need to relax from a big long year of school and this is not just convinient for for young people, we also know that we have a clear example of Adult people( older people)

they also need a big break from their jobs because they might feel really tired or stressed with work same as students and so that i am not trying to compare adults with young people I know they have even more responsabilities with their lifes but students comes to be more understanble because of the reason that they need to save more energy and have enough sleeping time but adults also need the same things and due that many jobs required just a week of vacation (sometimes even more) they feel really streess and tired and that why they would really wish to have a big vacation to can spend time with their family etc. same with student now that they have the opportunity to have a big vacation enjoy it.

Plus many students really love summer because the weather( the warm breeze) the feeling of summer or the feeling that you know like freedoom not worry about your grades, activities, projects and etc. makes a lot of diference between a long break and a shorter brake, but I also take the position of the educator, I know they wouldnt like to been repeating things to make student remenber of the subjects they saw the last year and having issues with things they forgot, That would be really stressful but come on! Who wouldnt like a big vacation? good for some teachers that save money to enjoy summer.

I also take the student position and as student I identified my self with the first character I describe when Students need the vacation to relax, but theres another big example of why vacation should be longer. first of all some student plan their goals during the summer probably to get a full time job during summer ( i KNOW EVEN SOME TEACHERS do )

to can save money and spend it on things they need another example is to save money for collegue, yes for collegue.

and probably this is the major goal of many students trying to have a great summer because of the only reasong that they dont have as much support as the other students but at the same time I understand teacher or educators because their goal is to push us up in our goals and the once a year a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week of in spring and fall sounds really nice since some student may love the weather by those times even though they like to see the fall so theres not problem concluding with everything else it will be almost the same as the regular summe vacation except that It will be more shorter.

In conclusion, the break that we already have is perfect because of the only reason of that many student love it, the weather is so chill the beaches are already open and is enough time to go out of town to see your family and have a great time with them and good for those who liked to work during summer just to have some extra money or help a little of bet their spences.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0
6686DB25FBD0,"I believe that gaining life experience and learning from your mistakes and working hard, comes when we are always doing something and accomplish more. Accomplish more and always doing something is important to me because it gives me more opportunity to be successful in life .

To begin with,by practicing playing my favorite sport ,soccer everyday after school and on my free time; because I was in my school team and I was really bad and weak at it .Practicing helped me to overcome my weakness and to learn from my mistakes ,and also to know the rules of the game and basis of soccer.

Some people believe inactivity serve a purpose that led you to success;however, we gain life experience and learning from our mistakes if we are always doing something or we accomplished more . Also,by practicing soccer everyday and working hard on it,I learned tricks and how to kick the ball directly to my teammates and how to be good goal keeper and catch the ball as well. And that gives me more experience and strength to continue.

Another example,one day we were playing and their was judgments there,choosing the best player to be in the ""International Soccer Team"" ,depending on how the player plays and how they follow the rules. Three days later, I got nominated to participate in the International team and I also got honored for being the best player in the game and of course, that led me to successful opportunity in the future.

In conclusion, by working hard and always doing something makes, you to gain life experience and more opportunities and to accomplish more. To accomplish something is not easy, you have to face a lot of difficulties and facing those difficulties and get over it that's what meant by accomplish .It will walk you through a lot to accomplish something in your life, you just have to keep going and to work hard and never give up and all of that will pays off by being success in your life .",2.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5

I belive that the the people that found a way of making there own decision were so confidence that they had to decided on what to do. but if they don't, it would be wise to ask for assistance to make decision with experts so that way they can have in idea of what decison to make. because if they had made there own decision that they had regret that would have been there issue for not making a wise chose. but anyway people who are confidence can make there own choices.

other however the ones that need assistent might not know what to do when they have a decision to make. those people ask for help. they ask for guidance so that they can have more of an idea of what they are going to decide which gives them a more higher opportunity to decide which could led up to a good or bad situation. it all depend's on the person who is determen to decide.

6712BD512DB7,"I agreed that the greater of us lies and not in setting our aim high or low, but setting our aim too low will achieve our mark because many people around us are down and falling for some reasons. But, they are trying their best to climb up to the top in order to achieve their goals and learning from their mistakes. However, many others are lying or cheating to get a better score and failing down slowly. In fact, many people are working-hard to accomplish the goal that they want to achieve.

Setting our aim too low will achieve our goals because people have a weakness in their job and that's the reason why that they should be trying their best to fix their mistakes. I used to failed my math class last year because I didn't understand the unit because it's was too hard for me. So, I started to stay after school with my teacher and asking questions because I want to make sure that I understand the lesson. However, that didn't work out a lot as I expected because the assignment was different from what my teacher was explaining to me. But, I did not give up yet so I decided to study more at home and do some research about the lesson. And I finally understood the lesson. No matter how hard the work is, but what's important is that I put my time and efforts on it.

Another reason why setting our aim too low will help us achieve the goal is that by trying your best and work hard for it in order to achieve. However, many people are cheating to get the their goal so easily. My best friend got a high score on the test because he cheated and the test was hard as well. The teacher was wondered how did he got a high school on the test because he was the only one who got the highest score in the class, then he lied to my teacher that he studied a lot last night. But, the teacher caught him cheated on the test by using the notes because his answers was exactly as the notes said. So, it's not a shame that you are failing at something; but, it's a more worst that you lie to people and start falling down.

Also, setting our aim low will help us achieve the goal because many people are working-hard to get what they want. During the summer break, I told my mom that I want a new computer because my old computer is glitching and broken down a lot. Then, she told me that I work to earn money and get the new computer. She also said that it will helps me learn more things about the world. So, I started to work at a small restaurant and my position was cashier. It helps me counting the money faster and also it helps me improve my positives toward the other people.

Many people disagreed that setting our aim low won't help us to achieve our goal because sometime lying could be good for some reason and achieve the goal very easy. However, once the people find out that you're lying to them then you know the consequences. Sometime people starting at the lowest score to the highest score because they are doing their best of abilities to get the what they wanted to.

In conclusion, starting at the lowest point to the highest point will help you figure out what you need to do or learn in order to reach the goal. For example, if you don't try your best to achieve your goal and it's the worst thing that you could've ever done. However, the other are spreading lies to people how they achieve their goal easily and convincing people to be like them. But, keep trying your best and never give up to achieve your goal; then, you can get what you want.",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5

this a good council because if the city do curfew all teenager can be safe and they can have resposabilidad with dont breaking the law, with a curfew the city can try to keep safe all citizen and the young people can keep out of troubles.

My first reason why is important to try to make a curfew in the city is because in the nigth is too dangerous for the citizen and especially is more dangerous for young people,if we have a curfew we can keep all citizen and the most important the teenagers safe.

My second reason is because the parents do not have to worry about the teenagers because if the city do a curfew, we can keep the teenager out of troubles, and the parents can feelling good because everybody wiil be in home safe.

My third reason is because if the city do curfew we can keep the teenagers out of drugs and alcholismo, because the young people is the first coustomer of drugs, if we have a curfew we can take away of the jail at a lot teenagers. A curfew can keep safe at all teenager and all citizen.

67E711AF87A2,"Are you done trying to reach your goal in life? Author Ralph Waldo Emerson is right. If you have accomplished somthing in life but you are not where you want to be then go for more. Keep trying to go beyond from what you have already masterd. It puts your self out their, and lets people know you want more then what you already have. You will defenetly grow if you keep trying. In the process of trying to master things in life it will be important for professionalism,money,and being successful.

Having professionalism in you takes a lot of work and time. For example, Cristiano Ronaldo is a profesional sorccer player, he was once a starter in soccer. Of coures it took time and hard work and lots of practice to get to where hes at.

Another example when i stared playing soccer i was 4 and it was really hard, it was hard to kick a ball or to keep up with the ball, but i went to the feild with my freinds every day and i wanted to be really good so i did not give up. I nocticed my self growing a lot and now i play for a really good soccer team and planning on going to a good soccer collage. However Jobs is something that takes time and hard work. If you work hard at a job and show people that you are good at it, it can get you a better jobs in the future.

Money dose not come to you for free you must do something for it for example, when i was 12 years old i was to young to get a job so i would go next door and ask if i can mow thier lawn or if they had any jods for me.

When you are trying to reach a goal in life and you are growing big time more money gets involved, which is a really good thing. If your boss sees you doing really good at your job your boss can give you a raise or make you be assistant manager because they notice that you are growing and that you want to master more. The more you grow the more better you'll get.

When you made it to where you want to be, you were seccessfull. you tried your hardest and did as much as you can to get to the top. To be seccessfull you need to study a lot try to listen and watch a lot. when you are growing you make mistakes which is fine it happends to a lot of people. You will learn from your mistakes and lessions. For example when i was 5 years old and i was at my soccer game i accidently scorded on my own team and it never ended up happening again cause i learned from my mistakes. Some may say if you don't go beyond from what you have accomplished, you will still grow. They are wrong because the more further you go to accomplish things will make you grow more and it wil help you reach more goals in anything.

Always try to do more then what you have already done. Dont let anyone stop you. You will not grow if you don't go beyond from where you are at. It's good to do anything it takes to master something in life. There are lots of ansers and help everywhere to grow.                                                      ",3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.0,2.5
68256AC96C72,"At a young age some students are determine to identify a career they want to do in the future by the time they enter high school. For example, their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career in life so they can be successful. Students should not commit to a career at a young age.

Committing to a career at a young age can cause students to have stress. For instance, some students are being pressured by their parents into finding a career before they go to high school and that can lean them into having stress. The younger students in elementary school think they know what they already want to do for a career in the future, but once they get older and enter high school they start to change their minds about the career they choose as a kid. There are some students that have a strong concern or eagerness that they wont be able to find a career they like before they enter high school or graduate form high school. All of this can later lead to a state of mental, emotional strain, anxiety, or they start think they wont be successful in life. Students might not know what they still want to do in the future since they're still young. For example, students have trouble trying to identify a career they want in life. Students shouldn't have to worry about what career they want since they're still young and they can later end up to stress. They should also try to focus on being just kids; then once they start to get older they can start to think what kind of career they want to do later in life.

In conclusion, i think students shouldn't commit to a career at a young age because of all the stress they might get they might not know what career they want in the future. While this may be true, others argue that students should commit to a career at a young age. This can later lead them into having a successful life if they start to study the careers the students want at a very young age. For instance, when students start to study a career they want, they can end up having a very successful job in their future. Students can also work in a long-term commitment in a particular profession. Committing to a career can lead to causing mental or emotional stress.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5
6867A6767D25,"An enjoyable educational activity is Avid for anyone that has a dream they want to achieve. The first reason why

I say this is because this activity is not only to help you become a better person but also to encourage you to go to college . Secondly They give you tutorials not only to see where your at but to help you improve in any class . In addition you also get the opportunity to go on beautiful fun field trips. Lastly Its like saying you have another family no matter where you go.

In Avid you learn to become a responsible and hard working person in a way that you have a binder check every week to stay organized. Its like another class but in Avid we all have a dream that we all want to achieve in which we know we have to keep trying and there's no giving up in till we accomplish it. College is something not everyone is looking forward to as a teenager but some of us are, but if we start hanging around with the bad types of people it can drag us to the deepest part of an ocean in other words theres no coming back up to where you use to be. Not saying you should'nt be friends with that type of people I mean you can but in my perspective don't get involved as much as your other friends is.

Secondly tutorials are a big part of Avid it shows your teachers and peers around you how much you know and how strong you are and the effort you but into a tutorials to get in front of the group and explain what you are having problems with but also helps you learn from your peers and its like sharing the brain cells. Tutorials in other words shows your personality in a way when your not a shy person to go in front of your group and talk some people don't like that they like keeping them self in a inner circle talking less but listening to the tutorials.

In addition you get field trips which most middle schools or high schools students don't have that opportunity you get to visit colleges and learn about them it helps you know more about colleges and also having fun by walking around with a person guiding you to where you should go plus you get to meet knew people once your there. It's just a very cool opportunity you have to be able to do things not all students are allowed to do. One of the most funnest and amazing things the Avid activity has is we do fundraisers to raise money to go to King's Dominion and once your there you well be like I've earned this because for example your working hard and your not doing nothing fun like whats gonna make you keep doing that like even is you wanted to be someone in life your gonna work as hard as you can without looking down because you have something that's giving you the support and keeping you strong. In my point of view I'm working hard and something that encourages me to do better is my niece. The Avid activity is basically kinda the same you work hard doing tutorials and making coneal notes and at the end of the year you get to go and have fun with friends and ride roller coasters its just a really fun thing to do.

Avid for me and any other students I think would agree Avid is a family we do something everyone agrees and everyone has fun with it to no one talks bad about anyone and even thought we all come from different places around the world no one is mean to one another we all stay together we all learn the something if one the Avid students want to give up we make sure they don't because we're a family and something we always say when we're down is ''dream, believe, achieve ''. This activity helps you and school but also knowing your making your self proud but also you're parents and family .

In conclusion the reason why I think this activity is enjoyable is because your getting to meet knew people and you never know you would find you own best friend there. You get to do cool activities and join programs. Also its like a family so if you have a family that doesnt really care about you Avid can cover that in a way you can be your self and you don't have to pretend to be anyone else. Its just a big opportunity you get to be in it you should be a risk taker because once you are you never know it can lead you to a positive direction you can become a great person and become someone in life.

68685615FE0C,"There is a debate about the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing. Some people believe that the best way to learn is going to the school independently if the student live close or far and participating with more students in the classes. Other people believe that no matter on what way you receive a class, you always have the opportunity to learn something new. I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn, because the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class.

First reason why I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student can pay more attention. Sometimes when you are in a classroom with more than 20 students is really hard focusing on what the teacher is talking about, because there are always some students who really like to make fun of the teacher, laugh with other students, interrupt the class with questions like ""can I use the restroom?"", and in someway you cannot even take notes; but when you are at home, all by yourself, without any distracction you can really be sure that you are paying atenttion and taking notes.

Second reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily. For example, lets say that you are in a classroom with a bunch of students, each of them have differents questions about the class, and the teacher said that he is going to answer each question by alphabetical order, unfortunately, your las name is ""Generic_Name"". In this case one of the best way to get that question answer as soon as possible, is having a conference class between you and the teacher.

Third and last reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. There are some cases where a student just have one class every day; what if this student live half an hour away from the school, it would be way more easy if this student can take all his classes in two days online, also, this can be a great oportunity to have a job while you are studying.

In conclusion, the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing is so great, beacuse the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. So, this opportunity offered by the schools to give this type of classes can motivate each student that live far to not excuse themselves to not finish a class, also, each school that do not have this classes should considered create them.

Some people think its the other way around were knowledge is more important than imagination. imagination and knowledge could be used for a lot of things. I think that imagination is more powerful than knowledge because you can come up with many things and in order to get knowledge on something you need imagination.

Imagination is something you need to come up with things. You need to think about it first, get the things you need to create it, and then study from it. Imagination can help you a lot, You can use your imagination to your advantage, you can use it keep you busy. you can build things, draw things,and create things from your imagination. you can do many more things with your imagination. Imagination has no limits.

In order to get knowledge of something, you would need to use your imagination. You would need to take notes and study from it. you use your imagination to get knowledge. You can learn so much from your imagination and its very useful. we have to be careful with our imagination and our knowledge. Its ok to make mistakes while learning, you just have to learn from them.

In conclusion I think imagination is more important. We use out imagination every day. We learn things every day. It would be hard without imagination. Imagination can be used for a lot of things like making a cartoon show, drawing, and thinking. You can also use you imagination while you read.

Students like other things not all students like the same things. There are other things to try out extracurricular activities. I think the principal should think about other extracurricular activities.

Like other schools don't have only 3 extracurricular activities there are other extracurricular activities to think of like I said their's art, music, cooking, chess club, drama, computer, science, math, reading, writing, anything else not only sports making year books or student council if they repeat all 3 extracurricular activites that dumb boring and

Maybe some students may agree with these decisions some student will not argee because not all students share the same personality or have something in common and some students like sports some don't some students don't like making year books some students don't like student counciling. In my personal opinion art is a activity I want.

There are many extracurricular activites I want to do I would do art reading and drama because I love to draw I love to read marvel comics especially Dr. Strange Spider-man Guardians of the galaxy and black panther I love drama because I am going to be a actor, and a director when I grow up and I know a lot of students don't only want to do sports malking year book or student council students love other things. I know a lot of students and people opinion.

If you must participate in one of these extracurricular activities well everybody will think schools boring but the thing is it's the principal decision and chose if he or she want all the students to participate in at least all 3 extracurricular activity then you really have no chose but anyone can still disagree on all extracurricular activities maybe you can ask the principal if you dont want to do any of the activities.",3.0,2.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5

You can go swimming and enjoy the cool water on a hot summer day or even throw a pool party and invite your friends . Some people like to bike, swim and run to feel good about what they have accomplished .

Some other ways you can enjoy the day outside is by taking your sibling to the park. This is a great way for them to get there energy out and you can enjoy the time with them.

Somtime it will be boring to do our work always but it is good that we can learn it really good if we do it always.

I am doing my work and my job and my sport always because it will help me to remember it and also doing always is good that can learn us till we can teach it for example: when we are reading a book always it will help us to learn a lot about everything the people that they are not doing good and always there work and there job they are lazy people and they will not learn anything when they do not doing it always.

When i play soccer for the school, and we have hard games aginst others schools who have a better team than we do, but no matter what i am always positive. Also when i am at work i have stuff to do before leaving my work. i dont like going home late, so i am always positive that i will be finishing all the stuff so i can leave work early.

Doing my homework every night is a stuggle beacause i work everyday, and i do not get time to do it before going to work. So what i tried to do is do all my work fast at work so like that i can go home and get my homework done.

6BB4BEB51A80,"People can learn without making mistakes. People should seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important. People should not make their own decision. First, they would learn in a better way, also people need someone to advise them. As well, the world would not be destroy as it is now.

People would learn in better way. To begin, if people seek the guidance from experts they would not make a lot of mistake, and their life would be better. For example, a person who seek the guidance from experts it would have more opportunities. Likewise, a student who doesn't understand math class can talk with his teacher or other expert in math and the teacher can explain it. On the other hand, if the student doesn't talk to anyone he provably would fail math. In addition, a person who get a new job need someone to explain it what to do. While, if nobody explain it the new employee would make many mistakes. As you can see, the people who take the advise of a experts would learn better.

People need someone to advise them. For example, everybody have problems, but not everybody have someone to advise them. First, a new student came to my school and he didn't know the rules of the school, so he did something that it wasn't good and he get in big trouble, but if someone would explain him he would't get any trouble. Therefore, many teenager do whatever they want because they doesn't have anyone to guide them, and the result of that is those teenager get it many troubles each day. While, the teenager who are guide for any expert they do well in everything they do. As you can see, everyone need someone to guide for the right way, and nobody would do a lot of mistakes.

The world would not be destroy as it is today. For example, if everyone would have the opportunity to have someone to advice them the world would'n be danger to anyone. Furthermore, in many countries the people are in danger because their governors doesn't know how to guide a country, but if an expert took the control of the government the people would not be in danger anymore. Likewise, teenager sometimes live by them-self, so they don't have anyone to tell them what is good and what is bad; teenager many times do bad things and they don't even know. As I repeat, if the whole world would have someone to guide everyone the world would not be destroy as it's today, everything would be in peace.

In conclusion, if everyone would have the opportunity to have an expert guide during life the entire world would be better. Likewise, people would make better choices in their life. Also, with a expert guide the people nobody would be in danger again. Furthermore, teenagers and kids would have a better future around the world; as well, the world would be in peace, and people would learn in a better way. Also, if someone doesn't know something he/she can talk with an expert and the expert would guide her/him. Finally, life would be better and easier if everyone talk to an expert what is going on, so nobody would do a big mistake.           ",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.5

6C045F130B28,"Technology in today's life is, so advance that it has both positive and negative impact on people's life. According to me, I think that technology has change people's style of living. Technology at some point slow downs the physical growth or development of our body and it stops us from learning new things, But on the other hand it helps us to complete many task and save time. Modern technology has negative impact on peoples life.

People can check out books, shop, and play games without moving form place and talking to anyone. This leads to no physical activity, which slow downs physical development of our body. In fact, there was a survey taken few days ago and it states that more then 45% of middle schoolers in U.S.A has to take some kind of vitamin medicine as the dont eat their lunch properly because they watch t. v or phone while taking lunch, 38% middle schoolers have glasses because of sitting in front of TV or using phone all the time, and more than 46% students are overweight or underweight as they don't do much physical activities.

Secondly, technology stops us from learning new things. Technology helps people to complete new task in every day life, and then we get use to taking help from technology instead of trying it our self or learning it we get a habit of letting technology do our work. For example, if our mom not stopped us form spoon feeding then we would take it for granted and never learn how to eat our self.

But, On the other hand technology helps us to complete many task and save time. Technology helps us from not being delayed, it complete task 50% more faster than us, and helps us to save 25% of more time. For example, Our group got an assignment to do on Monday and the deadline to submit it was on Friday, So if i would read books to find some info, it would take me at least 2 weeks to complete that assignment, but thanks to modern technology,I was able to finish it in 3 days.

At last, I would like conclude that technology plays a major role in our day to day life. It has both type of impact negative and positive and it impact's on our life, but the main thing is ""how and when we use it"". Technology changes lifestyle of people and if we use it more it slow downs our physical growth and stop us from learning new thing, on the other it also completes our task easily and faster that us. So less use of technology gives us positive effects and more use of it gives us negative effects.             ",4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0

Have you ever though what you can do to stay out of trouble in school? You might always have that one friend that gets introble a lot right? Ways you can prevent that from being you is try to prevent from getting into a fights that would just make it a bad idea, if you know someone that is doing what they are not so post to tell a teacher, dont make a poor choice and you get introble because you decided that you were going to do something that your friends wanted you to do.

When you get into a fight in school the only thing that that will do to you is get you into in school suspension or you would get suspended from school for a while. You dont want to get in school suspended that would just get you in a room with a teacher and you are not going to be able to talk to anyone. If I were you and I knew that some one wants to get into a fight I would ell the teacher and let them handle it not you. Another thing that if you do while there is a fight at your school and you record it you could get in trouble by that as well.

If you know something is wrong with a friend and they need help from an adult I would tell a teacher at school that can help them or there parents if you know them. If you try to help a friend by talking to the person that made your friend feel upset you could feel a friends mom or some adult you know close to your family.

When you made a poor choice it could get you in a lot of trouble when you are hanging around with friends and they want to do something thats not a good choice you could talk to them and tell them that is not going to be a good idea. A lot of times when kids make a poor choice they would have to face the consequences and they may not like them but they should of thought the things two times before they made there design.

There are so many different ways that you can stay our of trouble but theses three are the most common ones that i know of try not to get into a fight, help out your friends or tell an adult if they need help from some one, and dont make poor choices.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

Although some people say that technology have a negative effect on peoples lives because technology is making people to not socialize, actually technology helps the people to communicate with others that are far away and technology makes people's lives easier.

The people who said that technology has a negative effect on people's lives have their reasons. One of the most important reason and approved from experts is that technology is making people to not socialize. According to scientist now in days people rather to play on their electronic devices instead of going out. According to an article people expend at least 10 hours playing videos and using social media.

However, technology helps the people to communicate with others that live far away. A lot of people have now the opportunity to communicate with their family thanks to technology. Technology allows people to video call others and to have connection with others and socialize with people around the world via internet. A good example can be soldiers. Sometimes soldiers are out of the country and the only way they can communicate with their families is by video calls.

Also, technology makes people's lives easier because you can shop via internet, complete your work, and plan projects. Technology gives people an advantage to have an life without stress. In other works technology helps people to have better life. Thanks to technology we have the access to success in our lives.

Imagine in a world that is trying to change you in everyway.

I'm disagree because you have right to do what you want to do with your life or who you want to be in your life and nobody have to say what you need to do. Example; all people in this world have rights, bacause alot people trying to change your life, and they want you to do what they said, if you think you are right do not lessent to the people.

To many time the comunity try to change your descision and they do not respect what you said. that's why is alot problem in the poblation. Example; to much politician people want to change customs and religions they can't do anything about it, because that is a decision from there culture.

If you took a decision about to put your own company and your friends say you can not do that, just try to do your best and don't peatention to him. Example; in a company every employer have his own rights like what time they need to be there or what time they get out the work.

The reason why i shoose disagree is because to many people in this world do not respect when you make your own decision, if you can do something do not worry about what people say. The solution to this problem is do what you thing is right; and the comunty need to have a good relationship families,neightborhood, and students.    ",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.0

I think has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive on people' live. Technologyy allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person.

Because technology makes people to become more single, we can do a work or we can finish something by ourself. For example, if I want to buy a book for my friends that he live very far from me. I do not need to go to the bookstore buy a book then call him ask him when does he have time, and we make a time to meet each other. Right now I can buy a book online and then I type his address to delivery. I just need to wait a few days and then he can get the book. This is the technology makes life more confortable.

If today we do not have technology, maybe we need many people to do for one work. We need cost more time. It is not a good things for us. Time is important, in fact, we do not have too much time in our life, we need to ues the less time to finish one thing. So how can we find a way to use less time to do the work? Technology will help us.

People do not need contact work together. It save many time and improve the work. We can use the less time to do more work.

6DB65C457200,"Students committing to a career when they about to enter high school is by far a great idea. From elementary to middle school students are allowed to choose what they want to study toward a specific career or what they want to be. When kids are still in elementary they can say what they want to be, but they can not choose the class for the specific reason because they are still kids. But when it comes to middle school students they can choose what class they want to take for a specific career they have in mind .

Student can commit to a career when they enter high school , but they do that when the student already know what they want to be or what they want to do by the time they enter high school so the student at they would be committing to what the student want to do so the person doing so chooses the class the person want to study . Students committing to a career is a great idea when you really want to do it .

Committing to career

When elementary students are in 5th grade they start carefully thinking about what they are gonna do,

because when they are in 5th grade it their last year in elementary school so they have to think about what they want to do. When they enter middle school and that when students from elementary school start thinking about their choice and taking their career choice serious ,because that when they start thinking what they want to do in the near future. Elementary students have 4 years where they take class that are chosen for them in the 4 years they study just to get good grade ,but they do not think about choosing the class for themselves .But when it comes to 5th grade they still study the class that are chosen for them except that when they start to think what if I could choose the class that I want to study for my career or what kind job I am going to study to be able to get that job and that how they start committing to a career .when it comes to elementary school students.

Middle school students are commit to career because they are teens and they have to think about a lot of things that they want to do personally when it comes to career or what they want to be when they grow up that when they start .Committing to career start in elementary , but mostly it begins for real in middle school because that when young teens start taking class like algebra,earth science,biology ,world history, etc . When middle school students start taking these class students think only about passing so that they can not repeat that class and some just want to pass the class but mostly it about passing the class so that they can be able to get credit, and that leads to taking the class the will help that person career or what kind of career they are into. When looking you will find a lot teens thinking about their career .The career they want to commit to and some teens do change want they want to be , but still they are committing to it and they can just change if they do not want to do it .For some reasons young teens around the world that are still in middle school are already commit to a career and that is a good thing right most of them are really into it , and they are taking their career far enough .So far like 10,00 teens are most famous because of their career that they are doing now and they take serious because they like and they are good at it mostly middle school teens. These days they are unstoppable for what they do sometimes they are good more than adult at committing to career when it comes to what they want to do in life.

Some people might argue that students identify a career by the time they enter high school , because they think some students can not do that when it comes to committing to career they think that young teens can not do it .Because technology has taken the mind of teens .They say that teens can not do anything because all they think about is technology and all the things they do they always use technology so some people do not believe that teens these day can commit to anything i .Many people believe that it is hard for teens to commit ,because they can not take responsible of what they do and some think that they are so imature .When it comes to committing to career the parents thinks it how they act at home that why they can not commit to career and some thinks it how they behavior when they are in school .Some people believe that teens can not commit to a career ,because they do not know what to do and some thinks that young teens can not do it because they changes their mind most of their time on settling on what they want to do .Bunch of people believe that teenager can not do it because they quite so early and so easily anyway a lot people do say that can can not be a good generation because they do not know what to do.

But it doe not mean that all teenager are bad some might change when they grow up and some might not change ,because they just do not want to change consoling the thing they might have gone through so for these people. Who believe that some teens can not commit might be wrong because people change teenager hood do change as well

.

For these who believe in change I as well believe in change people do change and they can commit to what they want to commit to as well as job, career,family or love. People believe in what they want to believe in so I say that commit takes responsible ,but I know that we teenager can change the world and show them that not all teens are the same and keep believing in what career you want to commit to because committing is not an easy thing to do expressly when you are a young teen or kids .I know people say that we can commit to what we want ,but not everyone is good at committing to a career when it comes to young and committing to something that is big than your own head or mind. So keep believing in what you want to commit to because once you found it I know for sure whatever it is you will success ,because we you teens work hard for our dream.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5

Some people are agree with these class, because classes in online it's bennefit and better for students, students can learning more, students can do a better work, and students can have a more time for to spend with the family. If the students will can study in classes online they can have a big opportunities and they can follow his dreams and has the all they want to do or they want to has.

One reason it's classes in online is benefit and better, students can learning more and they can have in the house because they can do a time for make all things they needed make, for example I want to graduate and I want to follow study but it's difficult for me because I don't have time for anything I can't not make my homework, and study for my quizz. I need to work for buy my things, pay my house and my car. It's for these reason that I frefer class online, with these class I can have a lot time for me, and I can make my things and I can do the two things study and work.

The second reason is the students can do a better work, and they can have a better grade. They can turn in a good homework or proyect with more information explained. For example when the students have more time, they can make a better work, because they are enfocus in his obligation like homework and proyects, and they want to be a good student is for that they can do effort for turn in a good proyects with the use the internet. They can do a good investing for make a homework they can find a lot information, if the students are a relax and they have a time they only need to study a few hours no is like in the school. In the school is more tired because they need to wake more early and they need to do a lot homework in the many classes. But if they study classes in online it's more easy not it's very hard like in the school.

Some people say that the classes online it's a lost time the student do not make nothing in his house, when they have classes online they lost time. For example, when they are in the house they play with the cell phone or they are using his phone for other things, and they not study and not learning like in the shool. However, the classes in online is wonderfure because is a way to spend with the family because they can make a day fun with them and make differents things like play football, wath a movie, they can go to the cinemark and other places that they prefers.

In conclucion class online it's benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because students can lerning more, students can do a better work, and students can have a more time for to spend with the family. This is important and benefit because students can make a lot things, and they have a more time for make a lot things wathever they want. If the students take a classes online this is benefit for them and have a lot adventages, and they can do the both things work and follow study in online classes and they can follow the goals like find a good job and finish his studies.

The summer break is made to a students's benefit, it help the students as a relajation during the summer. The students have to spend time with their family a lot as possible they can. Some of them need to make money, and they take the summer break to make it. That is why I am not agree the educators that does't wants the summer break long.

One reason,the students are in the school almost a whole year, and all that time they are stressed by all the work they have to do in the school. Caming the summer break the students wait it with antusiasm, and work hard to finish the school's work and enjoy summer break, it help them as a relajation after a school's stress, they have to forget the school by a mommet, and relax their brains. Second reason, during the school's time the students does't have a lot of time to spend with their family, and the summer break is a good time of the year to spend it with their dear, persons, friends, classmate, girlfriend, and family. After it, the students are more prepared to star the school's year concentred at what they have to focus in the school with a clean brain ,and do all the school's work. Third reason, some students have some obligations in their homes, for example some of those are: pay cellphone, pay room, buy food, and pay car, so some student take advantages of the summer break to make some money to helps them to pay all their obligations in their homes, and don't take the school's time to spend it in other obligations, and take their time just to teh schools.

6EB1681A5880,"I disagree that students should be required to take an arts as a class but as an elective they can choose between what type of art class that they want to take,for example if a student wants to take a music class as a elective they,ll have to check in with their counselor to see what class that they don,t need so that empty spot can be the elective that they have chosen.

Electives can be helpful to students because it teaches them something new about the history of the different kinds of arts class and help them understand whats going on around the world and teach them how to play instruments and see where the origin is from and how it is played,art is teaches student s how to paint and make clay and shows who are most the famous painters,where they,d come from and how,d they became such great artists. drama shows who are the greatest actors,famous plays and how they became famous.

Students say that an elective is better than it be a required class because its like having free time but you get to do something that you dont get a chance to do and it could be a career in the future for someone who is interested in doing it and sometimes the counselor puts the students into an elective that dont like and its not a required class and if they dont like it they don,t have a choice but to stay in the elective .

Therefore students should be able to choose their own elective rather than it to be a required class that you need to pass in order advance into the next step of life and it will help them learn something in the future and remember what happened during their time in that they spent in that elective.

After keep studying students should make positions on what they already are studying,thinking as a young age students are more creative with their minds and heart; Students should think as young age for a beneficial purpose,deciding on a career at a lower grade (8th) many societies et their students have this opportunities to choose their path and make changes on what they really want in their life,the're changing from a playful mind into a mind where teenagers starts to make decisions; In reality this is a path where they would finally decide what they want or could be do for being graduated as a honorable person, by doing the most of the students frequently found what they would do and could be doing on their future as a older person, as they think they organize them self and be more clear on their positions in life.

This could make a big change for teenagers, now they show they can make a more positive and strong decisions, to show that they make better decisions as a lower grade society could being tested for all middle schoolers and keep track on how do students on how they are getting ideas as they turn from Middle School to High School; Most of the students decide good careers and some of them great careers, but is not only about choosing a career is about what students could think as a teenager; having students deciding on what they think the're going to be success.

However, letting young kids think on what the're going to study as a career would not be the best because not all students want to keep studying before High School; it would be a waste of time and effort to give them a great opportunities to start thinking as young adults, this could not benefit all students because as they get into High School they keep changing careers and by the end of their 4 school year they didn't decide what career they want to take, most of students end up not enjoying their career and giving up deciding they shouldn't get that career and deciding to not finish the college. Therefore, students could not take a career they didn't want but if they know they could pass and be an excellent person, even in the career they didn't decide to take they could make even a better life in their future by choosing and changing the career they were thinking as they were at Middle School, they continue thinking on what they want until they reach what they're looking for in real life as a young adults.

By telling this students should see and think very carefully as parents understands their children and teachers helping their students how they could or might do to get that career on what they need to focus on, for society is really difficult to choose right ways hat might help students and which ones might not letting students choose sense their getting more knowledge they will increase the capacity to get into what career benefits them as students,there are many student that want a career and the society helps them with their courses a they are getting into High School, their final thoughts and knowledge finish for them and they should start to think more in what he career is and how they're going to deal with their job ",3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5

The reason of that is because nowadays theirs youtube and most of the people have phones computers and TV's and so people can go learn stuff from phones,computers,and tv. And theres places that you can learn math too.

The reasons of why i think its fair for having shorter school time is because sometimes you learn something that you've learned already and in the other hand its just not fun anymore either i mean for some other kids they think its fun and some not. And also i've seen on twitter that they been hating on the guy who tells us if school is closed or not and people always hope that school is closed because no one is really looking foward to go to school on a monday and my opinion going to school on a monday is the worst and some other people might think the same as well.

Some celebreties became famouse for example Eminem who is a rapper he dropped out of highschool and he became famouse for something that he likes to do i would do the same if i didn't what to go to highschool but i wont because i have really good friends and all the years i've known them i just can't leave them like that.

I guess it just wont be fair y'know to leave someone you've known for awhile and just become famouse and while there in school working hard.

I guess we could all agree that we should have shorter school time because what if your doing something and you don't get to finish your project or something important you'll have to wait intill you get out of school and then come back and what if theres traffic and then you get home around 8:30 to 9:00. You wont have that much time to finish your project but if you live close to the school then i can't complain but i agree to this because like how i said we have phones,computers,and TV's and on the internet you could learn anything you want for an example you could learn about 10th grade stuff even though your an 8th grader maybe your interested in that.

My point here is that we should have shorter school time because nowadays we could learn by ourselfs and for the preschool kids and kindergarden kids they should stay there a little longer because they are toddlers and they can't learn anything by them selfs but for us we should i have shorter time in school hopefully you could understand. I don't want this to effect anyone but like it'll just make all the kids who go to school have more time when they have to do something important instead of coming home late and barely have anytime to finish there project or anything they need to do but thats my point of view.

709156BCF733,"Dear Principal:

I think students must have a least a B average to participate in sports. That way the students can bring their grades up. A lot of students would want to bring their grades up because they would like to participate in sports. That's a way students can bring up their grades. Maybe the students can bring their grade up and that way the students can work harder in class.

That way students can work hard and participate in a sport that they deserve for getting good grades. This policy may work so students can bring their grade up and stop failing their classes. One way they can bring up their up and be able to participate in sports is by turning in there homework and completing their work in class.

Here at SCHOOL_NAME we have a policy that says "" If you have more than three (F)'s you cant participate in a sport"". That's why a lot of students try to get a good grade, and that's why the students turn in all their work, in order to participate in a sport.

722C353F2831,"I agree with being honest because holding the truth for so long can hurt a persons feeling wether you know them for long. Being honest is a good choice because it is over to get easily without lying and worrying about it later on about it and what you did. Lying about something you did do could get you to make the person believe that they aren't your friend or aren't special to you but telling to truth means that they can also tell honesty and how loyal you are.

Lying would make it hard for you in your life (future) and the people who care a lot for you because they wouldn't trust you ever again or talk to you. It'll make it harder for you to communicate with them when you see them or try to talk. Later on your life lying would make you regret what you did and why you did it because you'll lose someone in your life as well as the person you love.

Being honest with you family and friends would be the best choice because later on your life you dont have worry about any regrets on your actions on what you did. ",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5
73038C17880E,"Yes, I do agree, because it's a great way of learning because we don't have to deal with other kids in school, we're save because we are home, we don't have to worry about going out to the dangerous world that we in now. For example I have friends that do school at home and they are just like regular kids from High School, a lot of people would say that being home school its like going to prison but it's not, home school just gives us a better way of learning at home with no one to bother. Another benefit of being home school is that you never have to worry about school shooters bad people in school, getting abues in school, not dealing with any problems with other students. Another benefit of being home school is that you dont have to wake up early in the morning to go to school, you don't have to miss the bus anymore, don't have to worry about sports, staying after school, basically you have freedom to do more stuff, a lot of people in high school dont have time to go out or have som fun, not many kids are able to go out becasues their parents are strict and dont let them out but that's besides the point, many kids take avantange of home school some of those kids, they have parents that travel around the world and they dont have a chance to sit down and talk about what is going on in school or the everyday life, their parents will take their kids with them becasue they dont want their kids to be home alone, instead they take the kids with thme so they don't have to miis out on their aventues, and a lot of these kids are very talented and ready for the out side world becasue their education was high quiality and always on point. They are good kids and bad kids that do home school, some of them coud have got in a ot of trouble and its not able to go back to school and some kids are home school because their patrenst have to work out of the country and they can be home by their selfs and they take thier kids with the.

73D2B941F40F,"Would students benefit from being able to attend classes for home? In my opinion that wouldn't be a good idea but also be a great idea. School should allow students to decide if they wanna attend at their school, home, or both. Anyways it's a good idea that some school allow their kids to attend classes from their own house.

Allowing students to attend classes from school is good idea. That's giving the students time to do there work and to learn whenever. Students could sleep one or two more hours in. Most kids either play sports, have a job, or maybe both. They won't get much sleep then they will be tired the next morning. If we could have classes at home students wouldn't have to worry about sleeping in class and getting yelled at by the teacher. Most students wanna be home school because they either get bullied, tired of getting in trouble, but mostly students these days wanna graduation early.

If we also had classes at home more kids will be more safer than at school since what's happening right now in 2018. students wouldn't have to deal with getting suspend or expelled because most kids these days get that. School wouldnt have to deal with drugs, gang violence, or anything that's harmful to the school. Then school drama wouldn't happen a lot in school if we could just be home. It will also be a great idea if we could attend classes from school and at home.

It wouldn't be a good idea because most students wouldn't do anything or make someone else do it. Some students like to be teach in person and if they were at home then they can't learn at all. some students are just too lazy. What about gym and other non core classes? We could have a time when they gotta start there class and if they don't sign in then they get mark absence. If they have a non core class then they can just go to school to take it but most classes you could probably take online.

I hope you think about changing school to allow students to take classes at home, or allowing them to take some at home, or both. Thank you for reading my paper hopeful you thought about everything and how it could change everyone problem. have a wonderful day!",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5
73D5C8D99F72,"I agree with Ralph waldo when he said's ""to be your self in a world that trying constantantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishments.""

although being yourself is a very hard thing to do especially when you have nobody buy your side though it all at first it seems easy but once you try so hard to make people proud you would wanna feel like fiting in.

But yet again here we are learning from our own mistakes why try to make our self just what others want us to be, why cant we just be us for just simply pleasing ourselves I wish we woulden't care what people think about us but do , but we have to face reality sadly weather we like it or not theres no alternatives.

Because whats the point?, just to be something we are not, for example one we would be lying to ourselves and second either way no matter how much we try its never enough for anyone because at the end of the day how we choose to be either our self or not nobody will ever be pleased with our decisions not the other way around.

Sometimes our influences may proswade us and to a sertin point we try so hard not to fit in but the people that we hang around the most we reflect upon them even if we see it or dont at the end of they day they try but the real question is do they succeed? yes but only temporary nothing lasts forever everything has its timing when it should or wont come to our lives.

I mostdefinlty agree to being yourself is a huge accomplishment, but we might not understand at the moment, how or why but we will soon rather then later at first its complicated even difficult although its just tempawarly things that accur in that priest moment it can also be for our great or good but we should've been proud of what diden't thad happen.

So i believe sticking with yourself is always the best policy dont worry what people say about you, you know where you stand dont let anyone tell you so plus being yourself will mark the difference in you people cant always tell what you are they dont define you thats for you to decide not them,So dont be embarrassed of yourself show yourself off believe in yourself because your limit is and only you.

They do draw, They had the same teacher everyday, They had 4 teachers, one of gym,other of music other of draw and the teacher of scients, math , They go to the lunch 11:30, In the morning in the cafeteria they can take a bag with food inside the bag had apple, milk,juice, and then when they finish the they put the trash in the trash and when is time for lunch they go to the cafeteria and take the food sometimes they eats in the class, Sometimes they eats in the cafeteria to, If you don't speak English you had a teacher of Spanish of depend what language you speak she help you to what do you need, They give a dictionary to you, That helps you to search the word you don't know, They don't fight is rare to see is fight in elementary school, Sometimes happened but is rare when that happened in elementary school, A day in the morning in the cafeteria two boys start to fight that was fast because the security coming to the fight he separe the the guys he take to the office and everything was fine, But in elementary school the fight are fast, In middle school or high school the fight are extreme the security don't cant separe the students because sometimes the others students coming to the fight to sometimes is because they friends are in the fight and they wants to help the friends, Everymorning when you enter to the class i always take a computer and i do what i want that is good, Because that help to learn more English to me.

745F880CEFA7,When someone is asking for advice they might talk to more than one person because someone might have better advice than someone else or might have better and more advice than somebody else. I think people ask multiple people because the person who is asking for advice wants the most advice and best information and opinions from others. Another reason why someone might ask multiple for advice is that everybody has different experiences throughout their lifetime and might know more stuff because of those experiences throughout their lifetime. People might ask the elderly for advice because their wise and have lived a long life so they might know alot of information to pass on. Everybody has different opinions but hearing different opinions from others can help you make a better choice. I think you should ask your parents for advice first before you ask anybody else for advice because your parents are the one the ones who raised you and they know what's best for you. For example your parents probably told you when you were little to not to talk to strangers because they know its the best for you. Your parents also might have told you that to always tell the truth because its not good to lie. By asking alot of people for advice and hearing other peoples opinions and experiences throughout their lifetime you now know alot of information and advice from others with that you can make a better choices.,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0
750AFA674F45,"I think students would not benefit taking online classes or videos conferencing from home. Students not learn to much because they do not receive a good explication about the class as a real teacher would to explains in the school,

not have rulers and online classes not catches the students attention.

Students not learn to much taking online class because they need to receive a good explication about the class, as real a teacher explains in the school. For example, if you are a student but you have questions and doubts, but the classes online or videos conferencing does not answer and give you good explications about the class. Would you learn while you are keeping in mind all your questions and doubts? Other reason is that students do not learn taking online classes from home because they get confusion, not understand the class and they give up when nobody help them.

Would you able to do the right thing when there are not rulers taking a class? Electronics devices are the most powerful and useful tools that help us nowadays like cellphones, smartwatch and computers. However, many students are using electronic devices in the wrong way. For example, students that are taking online classes from home, they don't have rulers and they are using their phones to watch movies or texting with friends. This steal the students concentration, while they are taking the online classes. This can not happen during a normal day of school because teachers do not allows students to use electronics devices during class time. But students do not have the same rulers at home that teachers makes at school. This not benefit the knowledge of the students at home.

Online classes or videos conferencing not catchs the students attention like a teacher makes it. For example, if you are taking online classes from home and you are at the midpart of one the lesson but you get hungry then, you left the lesson to get eat. After eat you say, ""I want to go to the park,"" then, you, went to the park, so forged all about your lesson. Would you able to do the same during a normal day of class in the school? A teacher does not allows that a student left the school or to go to the park at the midpart of the class, while he is teaching because he wants to catch your attention to make you to learn more and morer. However, online classes or videos conferencing you can stop it and go or do whatever you want, then you lose knowledge abou it.

Some say that taking online classes or videos conferencing from home is a benefit for students. They are wrong because the students not learn to much and they would have bad grades. Other say that online classes or videos conferencing explain in good details.. They are wrong because real teachers explain better than online class or videos conferencing.

As you can see, taking online classes or videos conferencing from home, not helps the students to learn because if they are confusing they will get bad grades , nobody answer their question or doubts and they don't have rulers or limited to use any electronics devices. This is not a benefit for students.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
767920BDAD93,"Wouldn't it be better if you have the option to attend your classes from the commodity of your house? Although some say that distance learning would not benefit students, actually students should be benefited from distance learning to attend their classes from home because it can help students who have disabilities and it can also help students see school from a different perspective of learning.

Those who believe that distance learning would not benefit students have their reasons. They believe students could have trouble with social interaction in the future. They also think that it can motivate students to be dependable on artificial life. For example, my friend PROPER_NAME who rather attend his classes online and also rather spend his time playing video games and not with his family or friends.

Distance learning can benefit students who have disabilities. When I used to live in Honduras, I had a friend called Generic_Name. Generic_Name had a weird condition on her legs, she could not walk. It was very hard for Generic_Name to attend school. Her mother, called Generic_Name, had to push her wheelchair every morning so that Generic_Name could attend school. Our school was about 30 minutes away from home, by walking. During school time, Generic_Name had to push her wheelchair to get to her classes, restroom and recess. Even though, Generic_Name would get ready early in the morning, she would usually be late for school. Sometimes, Generic_Name would not get good sleep, so it was very hard for Generic_Name to pay attention in class. I think that it was not Generic_Name's fault for not attending school on time. I think that people with disabilities like Generic_Name, can benefit to attend classes online from home. It would save them time, so that they can get a good sleep to pay attention in class.

Distance learning can benefit students see school from a different perspective of learning. Last year, my cousin Generic_Name, refused to go to school. My cousin, had bad grades at all of his classes, at the beginning of first quarter. My cousin didn't like school at all. He would usually say that he would always be tired to attend school because he had to wake up early in the morning. My cousin, thought that he was really bad for school. I would usually hear complains of my cousin about the school's free lunch or about him thinking that he was not made for school. My cousin then talked to his counselor about this issue of him not being able to pass all of his classes. His counselor told him that he could attend all of his classes online, so he did. My cousin's grades are really good now, and he also thinks that it was and amazing experience, for having the opportunity to attend all of his classes. I think that my cousin was not bad at school, he was just not receiving the way of education he needed. I also think that people like my cousin, can be benefit by distance learning because they can experience their school year from a different way of learning.

In conclusion, distance learning can benefit people with disabilities, to help them feel that their necessities also count as students. Also it can benefit people who believe that they are not good for school, so that they can experience a different way to learn and feel useful. I think that distance learning can benefit students with this kind of problems, improve and be equal like the rest of the students, regardless their way of learning.",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5

First :But is better they go to the school because if you need something you can took with you teacher or partner is past time with amazing friends and learning more about what do you want in the future ,the things and feelings ,ideas and occurrences ,memories and expectations and possibilities ,fear desires ,delight the smallest and most ordinary issues of our lives as well as the large and mostpowerful ones. then online web is the tools for study we have that permit us to share with others what is really going on inside our minds and hearts .they are the only intruments that reveal whether speaks and writes .

second : some times the students no came at the school because they live long them no have money for transportation or when need buy any book ,any students don't have the support of your family ,i think is the way more easy and very well for the people can do it some thing ,we need more people have want learning more the way the best election for our the student speaks , writes and lives not on a thing barren changeless level but with all the breadth and height and depht and movement yyou have a right to as a human being .As you ever open discover those words ,the online can be the most important web you ever open.

Third:There are probably very few people would claim online las their favorite book .However all the words are there ,it is the order ,But if you need company whose work it is to prepare materials that advance your learning and show you how to think for yourselves , the online web is the reason the words stand for things and feelings , from outline and notes to the final form of the paper .It tells you how to write paper .how prepare for applying for a job .However It gives you advice you need to choose the correct language and to avoid expressions ,after its helps you understanding their parts and pronunciation .

Finally : The online web is very well for everybody because in the web we can find the signification about whatever word, that we dont know and helps for keep going more learning for get good job ,after you can use the online web for look video that you are curious then helps own like better people make our life better for everybody, if you dont know the support your family the class online help for you keep gonig learning more .",2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5

7726A1F9C660,"The violin is a hard instrument to master, even with many years. It takes hours and hours of practices and skill to enjoy putting your time into it. I always had a great amount of interest in violins as a kid. Soon enough, I was given lessons for the violin. Somethings skills you would want to have is patience, knowing to push yourself to a current limit, and enjoying it. With those skills, my talent on the violin has increased over the years and overcame phases.

When I first shown interest in violins, as I remember, was in Generic_City back in 2008. We were at a gas station on a road trip, and stopped to eat. I saw a kid magazine with a toy violin that came along with it. That really caught my attention, as I begged my mom to buy me it. Eventually, she gave in and bought me the toy violin. I pretended like it was a real violin, and strung the strings with my fake bow. Ever since I had gotten that toy violin, I would not stop bringing it everywhere with me. After a few years went, I had moved to Generic_City and my parents decided I should actually get lessons on the violin in 2013. On the first lesson, I felt really nervous because my wish was finally coming true. I really thought I was going to be perfect on the first day. Of course, I was not good at all on day one. Soon, came to my realization that the violin is something you could not master in just in a year. My dad had made me a daily schedule for me to practice everything, so I could increase my talent and abilites. That's how I was able to go through the ""first phase"" of violin lessons went by.

Saturday afternoons felt super weird since I was not attending any lessons. My family and I had moved back to Generic_City, and I did not have any violin lessons. During the last two years of the four, in Generic_City I had be slacking off from my practices. Yet, I still wanted to continue with my talent and not give up. After a few months went by in Generic_City, I begged my parents to let me take lessons on violin. It was dejavu all over again from 7 years ago. We found out there was after-school lessons I could take. Suddenly, everything felt like the very first lesson I took in 2013. The new instructor said I was pretty good and could immediately start on the second book, instead of the first ""beginners"" book. It felt great knowing I was off to a great start.

Everything was going fine for the next five months, until I started to slack off again but worse. I always enjoyed playing the violin, but it began a chore. I was not improving as much, as I was back in Generic_City. I did not feel happy about the violin for the next three years. The thoughts of how the violin was not going to take me anywhere always lingered in my mind. It was not my dream to be a famous violinist or an instructor. Reasons just kept piling up till I told my parents about my thoughts and feelings. They had told me it would be a waste of six years worth of money for me to give up. I still practiced and slightly improved, but I still unhappy. You can tell if someone is doing something they clearly don't want to do, but are forcing themselves. After countless of arguments, cries, and rants to friend, I realized that no one can convince me to enjoy the violin again instead, I had to convince myself to. Our family was moving once again, but to Virginia. Every since we left Generic_City, I had not touched a violin in a year and that is when I was reminiscing on the days when I was playing the violin. I thought to myself, why did I hate practicing and going to lessons so much? The violin is something that I could never let go of because of the amount of work and years put into it. I would love to improve on my talent more instead of throwing it all out, it would be a big waste to do so.

You should always push yourself to a current limit though, not until you breakdown. But you can give a lot of time to decide whether or not you will ever be happy from doing something you don't currently want to do. It could really be just a phase you could be having. The best feeling is honestly really great knowing that you weren't pushing yourself to do something you didn't want to do anymore. That is how I grew my skills, and my talent in violin more. I also grew to enjoying the violin more.          ",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0

Each person want to be succesful in life, but to get what we really want, we have to be positive with the head up. We dont have to put ourselves in an unconfortable situation because it won't help us to get the succes that we want. It just going to help us to go through the way of failure. Not all the time going to be easy. We must have to fail a lot of time, it help us to see what we are doing wrong, and what we have to change to get what we want. We just have to keep going with enthusiasm and believe in ourselves. The sucess help to the people to be someone in life.

We can see in our everyday how hard is life, and how we have to strive ourselves to get the sucess, but we can see that there are obstacles and we have to know how to pass through it. Life is hard, but nothing is imposible if we have already planned what we want. Sometimes we dont get the result on what we have been worked. But nothing can be hard at all, we have to know that all is posible, we dont have to take it as imposible. One example that we can see in our everday are the students in the university. Not all of them have the support of the family to cover the cost to pay the the clas in the university. Some of them have to work to get the money and pay their study. Some of them have to fail because it's not easy to do at lot of things at the same time, but we can see that they keep going through it, doesn't matter what. To get the sucess we have to work and just focuss on what we want. At the end we can see the result. We must have to fail a lot of time, but we have to have in mind that we can do it. The people who graduate, at the end they remember how hard it was. But they believed in theirselves and also keeped their head up with enthusiasm, and learned of each mistake that they had done in the way to the sucess.

Other example can be the student from other country in high school, at the end of each year the student have to do a test of each subjet they have. But is not easy fo them because not all of them speak english, they have to learn a lot and out themselves in a hard situation to do it. They have to effort a lot themselves, some of them have to fail like three time to pass the test. But they know that nothing is imposible if they believe in themselves. They know that they have to take tests to graduate, we can see the hispanic student in Generic_School, they have to take the ESOL test each year but they have to study a lot because their first language that they know is spanish, and they just have been in this country in a little while. For some of them the situation is hard, but at the end we can see them in their way to graduate and how proud they are of themselves because it's not easy to learn english.

Also, we can see the organizations that want to help to the people who doesn't have nothing, they have to do a lot of thing and have to be prepare because no one know if they gonna get what they want. The goverment and other institutions have to aprove the organization and one of the best examples is Shakira and her fundation ''Pies Descalso"", she wants to help to the children with the eduation, and alimentation. She had to do a concert to get the money to start with her fundation, she has been in hard situation but she always believed in herself. We can see today how she had changed the life of millions of children around the world, how bennefitted with education and alimentation they are. child from poor families are now someone in life, some of them are in the university. All can be hard but never imposible. She accomplish her dream, doesn't matter what. In her way, were obstacle and difficults things. But she didn't give up because of that.

People have to know that doesn't matter what they can achive what they really want and keep going in their way to the sucess. Nothing in life going to be easy but they have to know that dreams can come true. They must have to fail a lot of time in the persuit of sucess. But they have to know that nothing going to be in the way they want but they can keep going until they can achive their purpose. Doesn't mattter how many time they have to fail, if they want to be someone in life they have to know that the way have a lot of surprices but thay have to have in their mind that nothing is imposible if they see that situation in that way. We all can be succesful in life, we just have to belive in ourselves and keep in mind that no one can make us feel less than them, we all are equal, we all have dreams and we all can achieve what they want in life to be successful.

77A31D0A07A8,"Author Ralph waldo Emerson wrote,""unless you try to do something beyound what you have already mastered , you will never grow "". Based on mine on experiences, I disagree with Emerson's statement. Because people grow up every single day, people learn new things from things they mastered in,and people grow no matter what they in .

Firstly,people learn new things everyday. when it comes to studies and growing, alot of people try their best to master in what they are trying to do. Most people spend more time to mastered in what they want to do but the more you study the more you grow knowing all kinds of things. For example,when I first move to America, it was hard for to master or get used to the culture ,food ,speaking but the more I learn more about the country the more i grow in it. now if I tell you can speak english good you will not believe it. you do need to move beyound what have mastered in to grow .Because you can mastered in math but you don't know the whole thing about stuff. so I think the more person do what they are mastered in the more they grow. Specially, people like my who have been teaching for this whole life is even grow as new generation comes in. In fact ,even a busness can only grow if the CEO of the company have mastered on that position and ready to learn more things about it. Besides this ,people grow every single day.

However, Some people grow single day. because the more you study for the things you have mastered the more you grow. For example ,it like teaching a kids how to eat. it does matter how mastered you have be paient with kids,

teach them everyday and more the you the kids the more grow to understand not only how to eat but so many thing they saw from you. we may mastered in one thing but it have so many things connected to it .that can help throght life without changing your the career ,job or whatever it may be. I like how some student take cosmetology, they take this for two year to have a certificate but that does mean the student all have mastered in it so that is it. you learn about it to take you a different levels. it laso teach them to skill not only on make up and hair but to be paient with costumers and their own friend too. moreover, people can grow throght new education about their woke.

Sometimes, people grow through new ability about their work or what have mastered in. people normally change or grow when there is to learn about what they mastered in. I said this because many learn more grow when there is a new change in syetem of education, economics ,bussines. For example ,doctor grow more when they have to learn more about something have ever seen all done but in same field work. like how you get to study more when you take IB course but not just they bring new things to help do you work on time and stuff.

In summary,I think that the qoute Emerson wrote was not right because how can someone mastered some that can not help them grow .people thing will help them grow in future .I think people who are hopping jobs to jobs or whatever they are doing is bad , because doen't help you to grow .because you get enouch time them you swtiches.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5
78018FB48420,"Students should not be able to graduate early. If students stay in school the extra year they have more opportunities. The fourth year of high school gives them more time to learn. It also gives them more time to explore different careers they might want to do. Students might be stressed out too much. It is better to take your time then to rush your career.

Students who go the last year of high school have more time to learn more. They can take more classes than those who would graduate early. The classes will be easier because they will be learning at their grade level, not a grade level above. They also won't have as much homework and classwork to do at a time.

The students will have more career choices to choose from. If they have more time they will be able to have electives that can help them choose their career. For example there is a nursing class, carpentry class, electricity class, welding class, and many more that can help them get started. If they can't take electives then they won't have experiences that may help them.

Lots of work on a students can cause them to be stressed out. Some students already get stressed by the amount of work they get in regular classes. Imagine all the stress they get when they are taking more classes at a time. They can get stressed by all the homework and classwork they get from all their classes. They might also have a job they have to get to save money for their college supplies like textbooks. Which gives them less time to do their work and study.",3.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5

Although some students will don't want graduate early because they are not ready to being a university life or alone life, nevertheless for others students is a good choice being her life or overtake her life, for example they have more opportunities for study a long profession like Doctor, students will have more time to doing think they like as to travel, and if they want can make a family.

Students make a complied because they want to study a long profession and they don't have some many time to doing all thing they want. The students said normally the people finish high school between the 17 or 18 and they know are young, but some time they need a break before to enter the college and if one student want to study a long profession he or she don't have so many time to take a break and study a profession like a doctor than is during like

5 or 6 years. This significant than student need more time to doing one thing fun before to enter the college. Additionally in the future may be they need another break after the finish college I opportunity the young people like travel too much and know others countries, they own country, they want watch new things, they know different s people, different language, different accent or pass free time with her family, friend, or play any sports. This is important because although they have time when they graduate at 18 or 19. Maybe if they finish high school when they have 16 have more time to graduate the college early and doing so many thing they like to do.

Another students want finish early high school to do others things so different like make a family and find a good job they like so much. So many adolescences think in money since so young , they need money, money for buy some material thing like a car, an apartment, so many clothes so expensive. This is important because the adolescences think finish most early high school is like they said "" if I graduate the high school a the 16 then a began to work like than i will have 21 i have all the thing I need for begin an alone life, then will want to married get a big family.

In conclusion, the this a good program of some schools than students can graduate in three years, sometime students need more time in her life for doing thing they like an the opportunities for choice a some long profession and have time to do thing they like or job for a better life.

ONLINE CLASSES ARE BETTER THAN GOIING TO SCHOOL.

Talking online classes are way easier and better then attending/going to school. Some schools offer distance leaning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. If students get this opportunity to take their classes online, ''I'' think it will be a good idea and they will benefit from being able to attend classes from home, Because Many students can't be at for many reasons,they can be sick or injured. Two, online classes help to students to take class at anytime they want . Three, online classes save students more time and money.

Many students can't be at school for many reasons, for example the student can be sick or injured. So the student getting the opportunity for taking or getting his/her work done on online classes will make it easier for the student, instead of students going to school when they're sick or Injured. So a sick student can stay at home and get his/her work done so they wouldn't be to spread the sickness or the disease around the school. And it can prevent people from getting sick too.

Online classes are easier because, students can take the class at anytime they want and do what every they want do after the class. For example Students get a job and make some money to pay for school fees and bills and also they can support their family with the money. And they can take the class after work or before work on online. Also online classes makes it easier for students who have jobs and the same time going/attending school.

Moreover, online classes can save students some money and time. Because driving to school everyday is a waste of gas, money and time. Students can save that money for gas and do something else with, for example they can pay bills with that money or even they can support they're family with money. In some cases the student can have family ''(kids and wife)'' and online classes can help the student to spread more time with his/her family.

In conclusion,

schools offering distance leaning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This opportunity will help students in so many ways. Students will get more time to get they're work done on time and also save money for them self. The students can do whatever they want to after taking the class on online ( spreading time with family and having fun).

There is a lot of people doing a lot of activities everyday and some others doing nothing than just watch TV. Each human person in the world have a purpose , goal to get in a future and is something that we really want to have in our life. Unluckily purposes don't come by itself as a miracle. Every person has a different purpose,some purposes are complicated to reach,and there's also some less complicated but doesn't make any difference because every person decides and picks what are their purposes and whether if they give up or they do anything to reach them. Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle..It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"".

Some person's give up easily, they think is impossible, hard, complicated, but basically what they are doing is waste their capacity to make something and improve themselves, just because someone doesn't trust in our capacity means we have to stop doing what we like and quit . It won't be perfect at the first try , it may not be the same thing that we were expecting, but the effort you put is what it counts. Quit is the easy way to give up , and that is they way to demonstrate weakness the people that didn't trust in us would laugh and spread the rumors of our fail. We won't feel good after that and we'll feel embarrass of ourselves , we wouldn't be capable of going out with our mind thinking in what other people is thinking . If we fall down we need to stand up again , dropping some tears and being in bed all day won't help , think in what other people might think about us won't do anything than just make us feel even more weak. What we can really do is confront the reality , understand our mistakes try to solve them ,try to get better by the time . No one is perfect we might see people getting their purposes easily and we can't understand how , what we don't know is the reality of how the live by the way we don't need to be comparing our live with others life .

A girl from school had extra weight and she didn't played any sports , she was lazy to walk and all her friends were skinny and she felt bad about herself and very ashamed of her body she tried to lose weight but slowly she was quitting ,she was crying a lot and feeling weird and unwanted by everyone , some students started to judge her and no one wanted be her friend and they were bullying her . A lot of girls bother her, and others saw her crying and hurt and they didn't stop them. Among the time the girl started to eat healthier and started to walk everyday she was adding one more lap ,then she started to jug and after run . Her bones and body develop she got skinnier and after she got back to school everyone got impressed .Now she was more confident and it wasn't easy , it took time , tears , sacrifices but she did it . This is a experience that taught me to see different the things , to see how we can do it

, if we want , if we put a lot of effort and we are patient to see the changes. After everything we'll feel great and proud of what we've done.

It is hard to try without being scared , without doubt .Believe in our capacities is something that we stopped doing , and say I can't became more common and we hear that everyday. We don't do things we want to do because of our insecurities and our laziness when there is a lot of people dying to have an opportunity. Always is better to try than just watch .Everyone has their daily things to do , some people work , others study , others do both or more things and they don't have time for them. It is necessary to take our time to make this things possible, it is necessary to have clearly our mind and see what are we capable to do and how far we can go . We can't limit ourselves with good stuff we need to spend time and learn new things , experience , teach other people and share our experiences and recommend and help others to never quit. Show others trust and appreciation for everything they get , be happy for them and give them more motivation.

Generic_Name an English teacher said ""People just see the defect in other person's life without seeing in their person's first"" . This is so truth , we don't see in ourselves first , we spend more time critizating and wishing bad luck to those making their purposes , feeling jealous of them because they could do it and we could't because we didn't want to put effort and time so we'd rather give up and do nothing than just complain about it and make excuses .That is not a reason , choosing a goal or purpose is something we need take it seriously because if you take it like a game then we are wasting your time , and the time of those person's helping us and going through all our steps , in our mentality has to be all positive .Being more strong than our bad thoughts feel proud of us,because we are doing something that others can't do. We are trying we aren't being like the rest and that make us unique ans specials, show to whoever said we could't do it or make it how wrong they were and they judge us before knowing our capacities. Demonstrate the people that was supporting us what we did to make them proud and we know how good we are going to feel that day. We don't need to take care of what others say, they might give us advises but we are the only ones deciding our actions.

What the quote means is how we make bad decisions an sometimes we just do what others do,or we just quit to something we were trying to do and it was hard so we drop off that and now we don't do anything else than watch others happy for getting their purpose. At the beginning of every subject we want to experience by doing it ,is hard , we got anxiety, nervous,sad,happy. It is so much emotions going on and we can't describe the feeling after we went through all that and we finally did it,we got our purpose we make it and the feeling of victory is inexplicable,we need more positivism in us.",2.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0

Students favorite food being replaced by healthy food will be a nightmare to them. No more pizza, burgers, spaghetti, etc, will be all gone and will cause a problem. Removing students favorite food to healtheir ones will be a bad idea. Students will dislike eating healthy food, and students will feel hunger and lose concentration in class.

Firstly, Some students will dislike some healthy food that they don't enjoy. For example, Generic_Name goes to lunch and sees the only food aviliable is a salad. He never ate salad before but sees a lot of vegetables including lettuce, tomatos, onions, etc. He feels disgusted by the food he was serve and rather starve. What I mean is that students being served to vegetables which they won't take a bite of, won't make them eat because they don't enjoy eating vegetables that was served to them and might get student to not eat but starve which will be bad to there body.

Additionally, the students will be in bad shape during class time. They will feel hungry, sick, or possibly pass out. For example, Generic_Name came back to class from lunch and he didn't eat anything because of the food that was serve. While doing class work, Generic_Name doesn't feel well and his stomach starts to growl because he didn't eat anything. He will lose focus and will start begging for food. What I mean by that is students in class will feel hungry and there stomach will soon to growl and will lose focus on class instructions. The principal should not make these changes and keep the system of lunch the same because there body will be in good shape and will gain energy through out the day.

Some people will disagree my reasoning and opinion on changing the school food system to healthier ones is a bad idea. They will say say it's a good idea because they will consume healthy foods that will make students grow stronger, will have a healthy diet, and be more energized within there life.

We can make plans for every goal in life, but it doesn't matter if we just have a plan because we have to work in that plan to get that goal done, we accomplish a lot things more when we are doing something, when we have that determination to get things done to feel proud of ourselves.

For example, when I was little, my biggest dream was to be with my parents one more time as a family, we were separated at that time; I was in my home country, El Salvador and they here in the United States. I had that dream, but yes, it was just a dream. why? Because I was afraid of the journey to be with them again, they used to tell me ""If you don't do anything you will never know how different your life could be here with us, so throw that fear away and let's do something"". Then in my head I said ""if I don't get that courage to make the journey I will never going to see my parents again"" because I knew that they can't go back to my country, at the end I made that decision and I made it, I am with my parents again and as a gift I learned a new language, now I know i'll be more helpful for this country because I am bilingual now.

Furthermore, we can see in every aspect of life how persons that one day were a common citizen, now are really important in the society because they were always doing something, they were working on their goals. On the other hand we have as example my home country, El Salvador's new president,Nayib Bukele. He was just a citizen like others but he was tired, tired of the political corruption that my country was going through, so here is what he did; he made his plan, he worked on his plan, he worked and made things for the country. Then he became a mayor because people chooses him as their mayor because of all his honest job, he started running for president in 2015, he had a hard time trying to find a political party that supports him with his new ideas and purposes for the country but the parties rejected him because they said he was to young,also they knew he was honest and that he will not admit any corrupt job that affect the country, and they were always looking for reasons to reject him, but he did not give up.

Finally he made his own political party and he get the support of all the people that get tired of live in niggardliness during the governance of other parties, he fought against the two most powerful parties in our country, as a result he won the elections in 2019 and he became the new president of the nation.

Many people think that it doesn't matters if you have goals and make plans for your future if you don't have some resources as money or a good social status, they can also see life as a random game which means that if you accomplish something they will say that is just luck, however; what they call luck, other people call it, late nights of doing something for what you want for your life.

In other words if you want your life to be successful, you don't have to spend your time just dreaming about what you want, because things may be done only if you are always doing something which means; work for what you want, stop thinking about your life goals and start working on them, determine yourself never to be an idler.",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5

In addition, you have to think about your ideas. Forexample, when I know the position of superviser is avilble at my work and traying to work harder and harder to get this position,but after three years of working hard they gaive this position to someone ealse at this time i feel failure and I keep asking my self why they did not give me the position. Moreover, after two month the manager taking to me about why I am not working hard same like before, and you telling him about the superviser position and you did not ask me for it you just give it to someone ealse. Socend, the city manager called me to ask me if I am still interstiing about the postion or not I said yes I am intersting for it. Then he meet me at the work and said to me to get the position you have to do a lot of things before I gave you the position I said a lot of things like what, I am always dowing every thing at work. Third, he said I have to work all the positions in the reastorant the positions are the following:Foodrunner, Host,Selver,and

Ketchen. And after all of that you will get a traning of two other restorants. In addition to that, I have to disid if I still need the superviser position or not, if I said yes I still need it thats mean I heve to do all the thigs what the manager said it to me to gt the position. FOrth, I accept my manager ofer, and i worked all the positions in the restorant accept the bartnder.

Fivth, the superviser position is good I will get good money and indepence on the location of the restorant our location in Washington Dalles International Airport. Thats mean the restorant always busy specialy Saterday and Sunday. Moreover, I am working with the campany since the open the restorant I am the seniorest preson in the restorant because the campany changed the manigment three times until now.

Then, when my manager saw me morking extrimly hard and when the city manager taked me again I am finaly get the suprviser position

Firs of all, when you going to failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm it is very great to have your enthusiasm and you have to belive in it, because this is the only way to seccess in your life.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0

It all started with a imagination, if the person who made a lightbulb never had a imagination of building a lightbulb we will be using candles for a source of light. How a about google, snapchat or even, books it all started with a imagination. Thats why I think imagination is more important than knowledge.

We all know knowledge is very important but with out imagination we cant think or read because imagination is the key to knowledge. Without imagination we cant think and when we cant think we cant learn or solve every day problems. Knowledge did not just exist like that is was made how? By imagination thats why why learn and do things.

You can be the smartest person in the world but if you dont have a imagination you cant help the solve world problems like how to poverty. Imagination is very important because with out it our lives will be more difficult for example with out cars we wont be able to go to work or go places and without phones it will be harder to communicate. The reason we have cars books and computers is not because knowledge but because of imagination. Thats why Imagination is the key to knowledge.

Imagination is very important, why you may ask, well with out imagination we cant think of new ways to solve problems or read. Lets say imagination was never a thing we wont know how to read or count to 10 because imagination is the key to knowlege Without imagination we will be having a lot of problems like how to comunicate, read, think, or even count to 10 thats why imagination is important.

With out imagination we as people cant make new things like books, art, or even better things thats why imagination is very important in may ways. Imagination is the key to making new things like cars, phones, computers, books, with out imagination we wont have things like cars, or phones. It takes alot of thinking to make new and helpful things. If imagination was never a thing their never have been numbers, books, or even a language.

Imagination is how we have things like google, computers, cars, books, and with out imagination we cant think of new ways it make the world a better place.

Imagination is why we as people are advancing and getting smarter every day. Anything is possible if you can believe and think. Thats why imagination is vary inportant is many ways.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5

There are a lot of way you should find to do something, and even if you would not undertand what you are doing. Don't give up, because one day you will realize your dream. For this subject I do not agree with it, because if you're making mistake often that doesn't mean you will never grow up. Sometime you have to force yourselfe to work, and in life you need to keep moving on, in what you're doing, you have to make sure that you never go back in the past, because you would like to realize your dream that you promised yourself in the future.

For this position you may say that if you are trying to do something, and you already know that it is not going to be right, just leave it until you find the right way to do it. If you have an experience to do something, and prove it you need to think about it first, before you try your best in what you were trying to do. You could have done something that you had to do. You have to check it, so to make sure it is good or not good, so that is the way you can learn from your mistakes.

Most of the time, you feel like you cannot do anything all you can do is just sleeping that does not mean you will never grow. You will grow in a good situation, if you are always doing good things and you never do something wrong. Now you will be growing up, and people will appreciate you everywhere you go to. For example you have already done some stuff that you are not supposed to do, life is going on that does not mean you will never grow.

My one reason i want to go to el salvador ,i want to go vist my famliy because i have not seen them in 6 years and i really want to spend time with them. Also i would want to spend with my baby cousin. the reason i would spend time with him is because he's a very special kid and he's very sick i would do many things for him. After i spend time with him i would take my famliy for dinner and they would be happy that i took them out to eat.

My second reason is i would want to go to the beach because i want to see how beutiful it is over there. Also many people say it's beutiful because of the ocean. Then i would want to go to swim! Many people say that the water is very warm because it's closer to the equitor, it's not like the US the water is cold. Then after swiming i want to buy a neckless for everyone in my famliy.

My third reason is i would want to try their food that they have because people say it's amizing. I want to try their poposa because it's better then the stores. The way you they make it,is they start with corn masa, then they make a mini bowl , then you can put cheese and beans whatever you want, then you close it you put it in the pan and let it cook. The best thing about poposa when they're over fill when the cheese and beans are dripping.

7E29ACA46157,"Summer vacation is a good break for the students to spend time with their family, also a good way to take a break form school and your annoying classes, to take some rest, change your mind, and think about what will you change, when you go back to school, also taking a long summer vacation will get yourself out of stress. you will be able to do other think than just memorizing stuff you don't need in a real life, that's why it's not a good idea to reduce students summer break just because educators say so, we need to have some fun and start learning new stuff about the path we want to take in our life.

First of all taking a long summer break will restore ourselves, it will change our personally there might be people that are devastated from getting bullied at school, some people that have stress and don't want to talk about it and need some time to think about it, some that fail the SOL,and are failing a class, and never want to repeated again, or get ready for summer school, some that need to get ready for the next school year. we need time to do all those stuff and make our life better, when we come back from summer vacation. Summer vacation also give us the opportunity to get a job and save money, two months is pretty enough to get you at least much money. Some students that take care of themselves need to have more time to get ready for the next school season, so they can buy what they need such as: school supplies,clothes, ETC..... summer vacation need to be long enough so we can spend time with our family. school is not our family but home, the only reasons most students come to school this day are to make new friends.

Second think school is worthless, we dont need to go to school for that long what we need is to work hard to achieve our dream, and have some fun with life, that's all we need, and if we stay in school for a year and spend less time at home, we will not be able to communicate well with our family, this is not a good idea, there are people that went to school, and got their high school diploma, went to college for 2 years, and are still working at McDonald for few money, that means they just waste a lot of time at school this whole year and didn't get any good from it, so if we stay at school for a year, we will then spent 12 year getting educated, and still not achieve our dream, still going to have a job at a fast food restaurant. we need a longer break so we can recover form school stress and spend time with our family, school now last for 10 month and summer vacation last for 2 months and a half, so we should leave it like that.

Third thing is taking off one week off spring break and fall break is really a bad idea, why because we need to have some rest and some fun. who want that, no one want a week off spring break and also a week off fall break. what, that's insane, we are going to do a year at school and get only a total of 1 months off out of 12 months what, no, that is a bad idea, if we get a year of school , how are we going to get 3 week or 4 week of summer vacation there will be no summer vacation. School start in September and finish in June so, when we will have a year of school we will be finishing in August that make 12 months of school, so where is the summer vacation break.

so some people might disagree with me, but i think that what we should do is change the school system. so lets say some students like school and want to get to the higher level.

i'm sure that they have families and have to rest. for example; let's take a place of a student that want to be a athlete, and is learning math, science, economics, and other stuff for 12 years without getting any lessons from the the types of athlete he want to be, so that's kind of bad and not good, why because getting educated for something you don't have any interest in or you don't like at all, it's not good. we can say math might help you a bit, but not everybody want the same things, also not getting a long break will weaken our brain.

Every country have the same system break as us, not all but at least FRANCE has the same as the U.S, by changing our break time it might affect other countries, students will have more stress and will not have fun at home with their family, parent might also complain about changing the break and going to school for a year, by the way every time we come for a new school season we learn new things and different things, At least half of what we learn just come in some of the topic, we will not have the same class as last school season, but new one and new different topic, you will only have the same stuff to learn, if you fail the class or if you the SOL in that class, and that's why we need a longer break so we can focus more on that in the break time and won't fail no more next school season.

Family over school, family is the most important thing, i'm don't know anyone that dont like his families members, so let's said that we should not reduce the school break, or go to school for one year, we should also change the school system so we can put students in what they are trying to become the future they want to build, the future might need more people that could do a lot of different stuff, we might need help for, then let's agree that going to school for one year is not worth it for some students and reducing the summer vacation is a bad idea.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0
7EA986233EDA,"One of minister Winston Churchill most famous quotes is ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Some people think that most people are consists on going with failure as a way that shows us that most people end up with failure again. They feel that it's true most people end up failing and end up doing the same process over and over again. I believe that most of the people should believe that success can be achieved only if you try but you will end up failing some of the times because first reason some people give up so easily and second reason they'll never give it their best some of the times and final reason is that people end up saying ""it's too difficult"".

First reason is that people most of the times end up giving up is because of the lack of things such as work or other sorts of jobs it could also be anything in life that people will give up on. It could be like saying it's a job and your been stressing out so much that you couldn't take it anymore so you decided to just call it quits, but for this problem people should always try there best and never let any other problems get into the way of their accomplishment, all ways stay positive and never lose on what you enjoy like giving up on it.

Second reason could be is that people don't ever try giving it their best it's always a been a problem cause some of the times people end up saying i'm not going to even try. you'll need to give it your best and try to give it all you got it could be on a test or it could also be on another problem in life by doing this you could achieve on being successful and end up doing great with no struggle or bad choices.

Final reason is that people end up saying that ""it's to difficult"" but by showing this people can make it difficult on themselves by not focusing or doing what your supposed to it can be in some situations where you have difficult times but in the end if you end up following direction or staying on task it could led to having a successful accomplishment.

As you have read that people should have any other way but to be always successful and always trying your best, you will end up failing but it's always good to never giving up. Only when will we ever end up failing that will always find a way to end up doing it correctly. On that day will we ever have to worry about failing.",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0
7FB017FAC682,"Well I think we should always be doing something because it take your mind off of other things in your head. We can accomplish more if we are doing something like people have accomplished a lot within the years and look where we are now. We could be farther but some people are always lazy and don't like doing nothing. Those people gotta get out of there house and do something for that world each person can change the world a little but at least they are doing something.

The most greatest people that lived or lives on this world have done amazing stuff and it's not because they are sitting down in their couch eating and watching tv,it's because they are out their learning more and doing more for us the people so we can have a better future and I want to do the same thing so I can give my children a better future and a better life. Think of it this way if they are building a skyscraper do they only put a group of five people to do the work NO right they are gonna but hundreds of people because ""much may be done if we are all doing"".

What Thomas Jefferson said is true we can do more if we all but our part but there are people that don't want to do nothing but that is ok because there is people out there that is putting more effort then some of us. Imagine if the whole world doesnt do nothing for a whole day where would our economy go to or our community they would collapse. If we all do our work imagine how our economy would go and how our community would improve if we would all do something our world would be a better place for all people and animals. For right now more people our doing their part than people that are not because if more people are not doing nothing than people that are doing something then this world would have collapsed already.

If your are a person that is always putting in their part you will recieve more than the people that dont do nothing. Look life is a test full of choices the choices are what define you and what you have done and they will define you your whole life and your choices may be better for the people or not but if their not the chose wisely next time because choices can change the world like chosing to do something or not. Its not bad to not doing nothing your not doing damage to no one all i'm tryna say is that your help could help the community and the world so don't be afraid to do something and dont be ashamed of doing something and failing be ashamed of not trying.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5

You don't have to depend on anyone when working working alone because if you have a group and one of your group members doesn't show up then your screwed because now your missing a piece of your project or whatever the situation is. It's going to be hard when working by yourself because everything is depending on you. So you have to do everything on your own.

first reason: you can't go out side to shop.

example:when i was in my country, i was going to the store, i was go in my bike or walk but when i move to the united states i don't need to go because, my mom just call to the store and they bring the prouct or food.

second reason: play games with your friends.

example: the last week, i ask to one of my friend who live in my home country if they continue play games like soccer in the soccer field or anther game in the street , he tell that now they play populars games in the phone and they don't like play games in the street enymore.

third reason: the little boys don't want to do others thing just stay in the phone.

example: my little brother who is to years old, he just want to watch videos on the phone, when my mom take the phone he cry because he want to watch videos or play games on the phone he don't do other things, he don't play with my other brother.

fourth reason:

go to visit family or other places.

example:when i go to visit my family or other places i can leave my phone because everytime we go to visit my family i be bored. and when wi go to visit new places i like to take pictures of the place.

fifth reason: you will be a addicted with your phone or computer.

example: i have a friend here in the school who use the phone in the class, sometimes he is play games , some times he watch videos, when the teacher look at him he is in the phone she tell him to put on his packet or in the back pack but he never do it, some times he sit on the back of the room so the teacher can't see him.

822F6C3B3C03,"I agree with Thomas Jefferson quote,""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" because yes we may always be doing something but we never really put in mind what we really are going to do.

One way to be able to accomplish things is if you have a goal set. If you set a goal that means you are going to want to achieve it. Prove others that you can do it and that nothing can stop you from doing it. Always give it your best, never think negative because if you think negative then you're never going to accomplish anything in life. Prove to yourself that you can also try new things and that can help you a lot.

Always be confident in yourself no matter what. Always put in mind that you can do whatever you want to do. For example, if you have to mow the lawn but you're in your bedroom laying down looking out the window, the lawn isn't going to mow itself because it needs someone to move it around. Trying new things doesnt hurt at least trying for quite some time and it also benefits you because you're doing something for your own good.

Never use laziness as an excuse to not do anything. If you always say i'm tired then you're never going to do anything, you're just giving up on yourself.

For example, if you hate being home all day doing nothing, then go out go find what you can do because if you try new things you'll end up liking it. If you're an active person you'll accomplish way more than expected because you're going to be moving around and getting out you're comfort zone. Helping others also can be a way in accomplishing more than just sitting there because you're talking to someone or showing someone how to do something. Helping the community in many different ways can also be a good thing but not just for you but the community, because you're going out and helping. Doing and trying new things motivates you to keep doing more.

I strongly do believe that if you're doing something that you put your mind to, then you're always going to accomplish more than expected. If you sit down and say you're going to do something you'll never do it because you're just sitting down. Your words are way different than your actions. To be able to do something you have to get up from the couch and do it without having to think so hard about it.         ",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5
82F7210163B5,"When learning at school with other students who cause distractions it is always hard to focus would you be able to focus? Even though going to school makes you socialize with friends and they feed you it sometimes is hard for a student to show up to school or even learn.

For me I would rather work on my assignments and others things my teacher would like me to do at home reason why is that some students would not be able to focus especially when a student is causing lots of noise making it hard for you to focus on your assignment. Another reason is that some students could live far from the school making it hard to get to school everyday. Finally students could have more time to work and study making it easy for students to revise in a quite place at home.

Students could limit distractions in many ways at home one way is that they can put on headphones to relax and work hard and listen to some music. Some teachers hate when students have their phone out or when they are listening to music so begin at home may cause the student to focus more by listening to music because every student has a different way of studying and one student might be more focus if he or she loves listening to music when working or studying. This also makes the student more relived that he or she can listen to music. Students who are always trying to bust a joke or make a noise causes problems for a student who is trying to work to get her grade up this makes it very hard for a student to focus on what their are supposed to do. Students can benefit from listening to music because for me when I listen to music while I am working I feel great and energetic making it easy for me to knockout my work at a fast rate.

Some students could live far away from the school and may not have a reliable ride to take them to school everyday. Some students can't catch the bus because the bus is too far away from their house this makes going to school very difficult because without a reliable ride to school everyday you may be coming to school very late making it hard for you to study or work on assignments because you are worried about how you will get home because you do not have a reliable ride to school to home. This makes a student stress a lot thats why working at home you would not be worried about who would be taking to and back from school. It also makes the student more productive because they would not have to find a ride all the time they could study and get their work done faster than other people. Also coming to school late makes it very hard to understand what was taught in the classroom making a student very stressed over it because a student grade might go down because he or she failed the test cause they came late to school so that student might not have understood what was taught.

Finally students could have more time to study and work on their assignments sometimes teachers may go through the assignment very quickly making it hard for a student to understand the what he or she or supposed to do. Also teachers may not give as much time for students to finish assignment working at home makes it easier because you have as much time as needed for you to complete your assignment and also for a student to revise over their work before turning it in to the teacher students may not be able to turn in assignments on time depending on the assignment this makes a student very stressful because they do not want to turn in the assignment late and get a late grade for it. Sometimes students worry about things like this especially when a student grade is flunking and they need to get it up to graduate or move on to the next grade level.

Although going to school could very exciting for a student or very happy to see friends your happiest place is home and if you could a student could work from home that would change the way a student studies and complete assignment because they have time on their hands and also the are relaxed they would not have to sit in a class for over 55 minutes. Working at home could be very beneficial because It could be very difficult for another student to learn at school because they might be that one student who is making it hard for a student trying to focus or a student might be stressed because they might not have a ride to and back from school and worried that they might not enough time to finish their assignment and get it turned in on time. Working at home may not stress a student because they would have enough time to complete an assignment. This is why working on assignments at home would benefit a student.

Being enspired by someone to do that instrumet or what ever you want to do you need somone to motivate you for example, their was this one time where my brother motivated me to play the chello and I did and it felt good,because I practiced everydaycand I loved doing it. Thats why practicing is important.

Having fun while playing in band or orchestra your able to travel to diffrent states to learn how difrrent groups play,

learn diffrent songs, and learn the sites of that certain city. Thats why I joined orchestra when I was about 9-10years old I learned about 20 new songs that 1 school year and I loved doing it. It was fun to watch, and hear them while playig it was probably the best year i had in 3rd grade.

The people in your group are like your family you guys are going to travel together and perform together. And even making freinds to the new kids who join later in the year so dont worry about being left out while traveling to that certain state your always going have someone to talk to be around.

In my opinion

I disagree with Emerson becasue even if you are a master in an specific area you never stop growing, everyday you learn more about your mistakes and about life and how to live a good one, also you learn something new that helps you in all types of areas that you have in your life.

However in this world there will be someone that will disagree with your opinion, because they have different type of mentality,or they think in a different way.

If you have a goal you never need to stop growing on it, becasue is something that you really want for your future and you want to do that for the rest of your life. That is why you need to choose carefully what do you want, because maybe in the future you can regret and that is a bad thing that you can erase,becasue you feel frustrate because you spend a lot of time on something that you didn't like.

Being an expert in an area is something really important, the positive things for being a master is that:

You domain your area and nobody needs to command you.

You can do the things easily and quickly.

You are an expert in what are you doing, so you are exited.

Is more easier to get good things, something that benefits you.

You can get great jobs with a good payment.

You can be also your own boss or manager.

There is also negative things for being a master:

There are many people that they are an expert in any area

You need to compet with your rival

You need to try to be the best

If you have a business and you are making some mistakes you need to fix it quickly because it can affect to your own skills.

In conclusion

I disagree with Emerson, becasue you can still growing even if you are making a lot of mistakes, you can still achieve new things,you need to grow in person and in skills,always.

You can stay in the position that you are right now but you can always grow and be better everyday.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0

840619A0CF0B,"Thomas Jefferson wrote,""Determine never to be idle...Its is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something,or does inactivity also serve a purpose?

The way you determine to do things is pushing yourself to do it, nobody gonna be there to tell you, when you gotta get your stuff done. We the people shouldn't be idle at all ,it would be boring ,not doing anything like just relax at home,and get fat on the couch,being lazy from time, to time isn't as bad. Also you want to have a break,so you won't stress out as much. Most people are determine to be inactivity and will get upset or,have a panic attack,health issues,It can affect your life to be honest ,and it sucks! that's how life is,it gets harder,and harder and you need to motivate yourself, makes your mind stronger. People who don't motivate themselves they got to at least try to get things done, and it never gets any easier....you just got to do it like this essay;I'm writing.

An inactivity does serve a purpose based on people who don't accomplish much by being lazy and not realizing how the situation can get worse instead of getting it done on time. People got to be always doing something ,and be well organized,it will also be wonderful too see people not being idle too always be doing something,so they would feel good about themselves and be like ""Yes! I did it!""and that way they won't have to deal with it anymore ,and move on with their day,just like anybody should. In order too always do something you should just look for something you like to do,to keep yourself busy like: playing soccer, working out ,rather not doing anything ,and just being on your phone on social media.

In my opinion being be responsible and accomplishing is a whole relief ,and taking your time getting stuff done can also help to focus.

For us kids our responsibility is to get good grades in school, and graduate,be successful in life to become better than what our parents were,or be a better person by being active and helping a church out .People sometimes need emotional support because everybody is different, everybody handles their attitude,or situations differently,and they might be going through something and it will affect their life. Taking a position of where I stand in school is me failing tests because,I don't study and I know,I should study but when I try too, I forget ,and forget the next day ,and I hate that, I know ,I can pass my tests ,and get better grades, if I studied this is one of my accomplishment I need to work on.

Thomas Jefferson wrote that because, he wants to motivate people to accomplish more by doing things and finding a job, and work hard,by being successful. Thomas Jefferson also did some things,He wrote the Deceleration Of Independence,he is one of the Founding Fathers and accomplished being our President.

There are lots of people in this world with different point of views of how they accomplish of always doing something,people try to plan out ideas to see what will work out for them, and help them think harder based on how they handle what works for them because,their is plenty of strategies in the world people can use to do something,what makes them feel more comfortable .It is very important for people to accomplish things that they need to do to get it off their hands and help each other out, if they need help ,and not stress about it but,most things you can't depend on someone being their,you got to do it on your own ,and if your stressing about it, you just got to relax your mind ,take yoga if you have too! but than again everybody is different and at least you need to try because,if you dont do that than where do you think your set of accomplishments is gonna go?.

Community park provide a lot of opportunities such as spending time with friends and family, sports and exercising, and doing school assignments. These are my three reasons what you can do respectfully and peaceful at your nearest community park. I hope you find these helpful for you in the future.

Spending time with friends and family at a community park is a good way of making bonds stronger with each other. Parks have a lot of activities to do in a park for example there is a lot of outside games you can play. My opinion on how parks can make your bond stronger is that you can talk to them while you walk, jog and other activities. For example Generic_Name and Generic_Name went to the park to go play checkers. They talk about grades and other subjects for one hour. Their bonds got stronger they hang out every day.

Community parks have a lots space playing. Sports burns calorie's and it is very fun to play sports. You can make new friends with sports might even get ask to play on their team. For example Generic_Name brings her new ball to her community park nearest to her. Generic_Name brings her ball to the court kids dashing as fast they can to her. A crowd of kid show up to her begging if they can play they make teams. Generic_Name makes a lot of friend and plays soccer with them everyday.

Parks are good way to study and do school work because it is peaceful and natural sounds help you get relax.

Imagine nice sunny day no wind hear of birds and grass bending every direction. Studying in a park will help you a lot because you are not going to get interrupted my neighbors and relatives. People from the park might help you and give you way and strategies to get a good grade on a test. For example Generic_Name want to pass his test. his sibling are loud he can't focus. Generic_Name goes to the community park to study for the big test.

In conclusion parks are a good way to do every day activities than staying home being lazy. I hope this helps you with your every day situation.",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0
85F5FADDDC0E,"Here's a fact why you should go to the museum, going to a museum helps you pay attention more. A museum is an enjoyable, education activity here's why I think it is, you can be with your friends,learn new things school hasn't taught you yet,you get to move around.

First of all, you can hang out with your friends, so both of you can learn together, understand, spend together so you both can know each other better. Usually when you hang out with someone when it's not during school you can build your friendship stronger, trust each other better. You feel a lot comfortable around people when you both learn together. Bonding together with someone is really important helps you communicate to your friends, when you forget what happen the next day you could ask your friend.

Secondly, you can learn new things school hasn't taught you yet, or understand things school taught you, but you forgot half of the things. You can review it again, you can also be ready when school teaches you that lesson or subject and you would already know what happen. Study shows if you go to a museum you will likely pass that class you're struggling with. When you go to a museum, improve you listening skills and pay attention better, later on you can pass your tests and SOLS.

Finally, you get to move around when you're in school your brain gets tired so it focuses on other things when it should be paying attention,your brain pays attention when you're moving. When you're sitting down you usually think about sleeping soon, and you forget things fast when you don't pay attention and get a bad grade in that class. Or forget what to turn in,or even forget to write important things down like notes, tips, what you're gonna do tomorrow in school. Moving around calms your brain down and your body too, you wouldn't feel rushed, or you wouldn't feel sleepy at all.

In conclusion, this is why you should go to a museum, you can be with your friends, learn about new stuff you didn't know about, and move around. ",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0

Most of the time, they do not think by them self. In addition the interaction between family and friends is been losing a cause of social media or videos games.

However many people think the opposite, they think live before without technology the people was illiterate, and they think the technology is a progress for the world. The technology brought a lot of invents like explore the human body, talk with the people that is not near from us, or maintain informed what happens in another place, Even still the technology is giving us a lot of sources like buy things without leave the house, but the technology is had been negative effects on people's live because nowadays many people, most kids and teenagers they do not think by them self. One of many example of that is when you ask a girl or a boy about something really important how it is, if the water has energy? Most of the teenagers is going to answer yes, and I know this because in my science class the teacher asked this question, and everyone in the classroom answers yes, but the teacher said the water does not have energy, and she explains why, but no one has convince and what she told, so they look in Google and they arrived the conclusion what the teacher say was correct. The point with this example is to see nowadays the people believe more and what Google or other things what form part of the technology say. if the people need a solution to solve any problem, they actually do not think about it. they go to the internet and look for solution.

another negative effect of the technology in the daily life is the interaction. I am going to expose my family and friends. when i spend time with my family and friend, they always happens in their cellphones, they do not pay attention around of their behavior. They lose the notion of their time and everything a cause of the social media even my brother he does not want to go out and play soccer or to walk, because he is more interesting to play videos games or watch videos. In actuality a cellphone is indispensable to live. to do moments that suppose there are good moments, or that is the people believe, but they forget the feeling to talk, to joke without check their cellphone every two minutes. We slowly losing our feelings, our taste for life, our friends, our family, and even our jobs. In addition the technology expose our private life. Example is for every transition you do, you need to give your personal information. The social media is turn in our worst enemy because across of the internet many people has been bullied for the videos or picture that they shared until to lead the people to suicide.

The technology is turn into robots without the capacity to think by ourself. thanks to the technology the humanity is turn in unselfish, unsuccessful, and unsure of themself.

Reasons. (why is good)

becuase is good for you live because you have one year early and this can help you to do it a greet estudent and with this year early you can go to the college early or you can work one year and after this year you can star the college, and if your finis the high school in three year that mean you are a good estudent and thats can help you because you can find a programs that can help you, because if you want to go to the college the college is not chip and for follow your dream you have find a solucion and the solucion is give you best.

88FD7FAAFA90,"Some school require students to complete summer projects. This is a great idea, and it would be better if the students would be able to pick the topic. One of the reasons is students know what interest them more. Second they would put more effort and time on the project. finally studenst inprove there skills when writing something they enjoy.

To start with, summer projects should be student designed. Students should be able to pick their topic do to they know what interest them and what doesnt. For example, Generic_Name a student at Generic_School was given a project about sea animals. Generic_Name doesnt know nothing about marine animals and has no interest on the project. Therefor, Generic_Name has no idea what to say and its not in his interest. Furthermore, Generic_Name will be in summer break it would be less stressful to talk bout a topic he likes instead of a boring one the teacher would give out. Also the students would put more effort and time to the project.

Secondly, by the student knowing what he likes and his strength they'll aim for that A on the project. Students alfound do poorly on school project due to the topic they were given. For example, Generic_Name was given the topic to right about sports Generic_Name. Generic_Name has never done sports her self so there she has no interest on it. Generic_Name will do the project and get finished on time but, did not put time and effort to do her best. Undoubtedly, students do better on a topic they all feel good about.

Finally the students will enjoy doing the project. Statistics show that when students write about something they like, they tend to improve in both reading and writing skills. For example, Generic_Name was able to right about a topic she likes, therefor, she enjoyed writing and improved her skills in reading and writing. Generic_Name enjoyed doing this project that she added more information about the topic. undauntedly, students summer project should be student designed.

Despite this valid reasons there are does who think teacher should pick the topic. How ever they are wrong. Because students should be able to enjoy writing, and with the prompts the teacher gives out they just get stress out. Unquestibily, summer projects should be studenst desinged.

To close up studenst will gain knolege and enjoy writing. They will aslo do better in the project do to is in there best interest. And finally a summer project should be fun not boring. ",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0
89A2B91E59C5,"I know that having career coarses is a great idea for students to identify their careers in High-school. By studying coarses in High-school it will teach students the requirements for specific careers and prepare students for college and thier career if not required for college after High-school. Having career coarses will make students more confident and comfortable in thier first year in college or thier first day at work becasue students will already be knowledgeable about what thier doing, and it will also give students a headstart in life and which makes students well prepared.

Having career coarses will give a variety of choices for students and will help them figure out what they might want to study. These coarses will teach students requirements, basics, and will give them an idea of what they might want to study in college or a career after High-school. When students are getting ready to leave High-school some students still might not know what to study, but having career coarses would solve that solution easily which will cause less depression and stress.

There are four years in High-school which is enough time for students to switch out of a career coarse if thier aren't intrested. If High-schools don't take advantage of this idea students will be pure pressured to go to college and study a random coarse which isn't right if thier not intrested, that could lead them to drop out of college and waste thousands of dollars and could maybe go in debt for the rest of thier lives.

Career coarses In High-school will give students headstarts which is very beneficial for students and professors in college. College professors won't have to teach the basics, but will go over them which would save time and this also means students will have a couple of extra time for test's and final exams.

Having career coarses in High-school will cost a lot of money, but why not spend it if are main focus is to educate the students and help them suceed in the future. After religous beliefs school is the second most important thing in the world. These students are our future and we want the world to be a better place and have a better society.

We should reach out to the school board and colleges and let them know, By emailing, calling, or just by using social media that this is a very important matter and it would be very benefical for both them and us as students,

We want to suceed and be educated and having career coarses is the best way possible, we dont want to go in debt for the rest of our lives for something we didnt enjoy doing in college we want to be well prepared and every student should have equal opportunities in the world to know what to study.

8A6FEEA6C0D3,"I think what Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote is true, because when all the people do their own self and become their own self. the chance for those people to become something else in this world is really high. They accomplishment to do greatest things in the world.

Many people in this world believe that becoming thier own self is better for them, because people would not have to deal with the negative minds that other people have, because by the way all the people have different minds and some people can have possitive minds but there is lot of people that have negative minds. People that decided they wanna become something else in this world with other people it would be really hard for them to become some else this world. The reason why it would be really hard for them is because they would have to deal with possive minds and negative minds. But the people that decided that they wanna because accomplish in be better in this world. Those people are the one's that decided to become their own, because they wont have to deal with no neggative minds they would just do what their head tells them to do without hearing negative minds and they just keep gone keep doing what they think would be the best for them.

People that decided that they wanna become their own, is for a reason they decided to do that becauuse they wanna become better people in the world, they wanna give their families a better life style, but the main thing is. They wanna be an example for their kids, they wanna show their kids that no matter what if they keep their head up and keep and possitive minds. They would be able to accomplish anything in life, but they would show their kids that become their own thins, it is not just become their own things, all that have work and dicipline, but the main thing is always keep their minds possitve. people that become their own after they make a family they would start showing thei kids to become their own since a young age. they would show their kids the work and decipline it takes to become their own self. When lot of people dont think the same way but each people have their minds set.

I think at this point in life and in the whole world. The people that should start thiking about if they wanna become their own is. All the people that is about to graduated High School. the people that is at the age of 17 and 18 years should be ones that start thinking about that. because all those people about to get until the real world and they gone see what real is, in the real world. people never know the obstacles that life can put on you as soon as you get in the real world. Life would might put you hella obstacles just for you to realize and see what you doing, so those kids that are about to graduated high school they need to do their best so they can go throught all the obstacles that life would put on them in the journey for them to make it all the way to the up to their dreams.

All this it comes to the people that they wanna become their self. They would have to keep mind possive and think it would not be easy at all, but doing hard work and always looking forward they would be able to do it. Everyone is this world can accomplish the greater things in this world and be better. All those people need is motivation and have their mind possitive to make it all the way up to their dreams. All hard work have pay off at the end, people would realize that all the hard work they did was something better life and when they look back at all the hard work they did. They would of their own self, they would be like all this n all the obstacles i had to go throught was for some better in my life and for a huge chance in me now i can said all the work i been done, it is finally acomplished.",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0

First of all students would be benefit from being able to attend to classes from home because some have to work and they dont have time to attend to school because of their schedule.

Second reason is that students would be benefit from being able to attend to classes from home because they have family, that could be a problem for them since they could have kids and have to take care of them and being able to study from their houses it's a great a option for them.

And last reason, because others live far away. sometimes students dont have transportation because of their location or maybe they don't even have school in the area, and online classes it's an good advantage for them and good opportunity to study.

Without explore you will never know what you are cable of and you will never grow in life. It good to be satify where you are sometime, But when emergency come to need to explore to see who you truly are. He is also right because where Iam from lot of people are satify where they in life life.

I believe that the more you explore the more you grow. For example If Bill Gate was satify what he master with out exploring he would had never become a billionaire and he would never discovered the microsoft. And if

Barack Obama was satify with his education/knowledge he would never had became a Senator or the first Black

African American president of America and he was never going to be able to share is idea with America .So with out going beyond what you have mastered you will never know who you are and what you are cable of. Explore beyond what you have mastered and there will alway be a suprise , a new talent and a new growth in life. You will never discovered your worth/talent with out trying. Some people have that mind set that if they explore they will never make it. The more you explore the farther you go in life. Always pray to advanced to a new level not the level you have master. My mom alway tell me never be happy where you at step out of your comfort zone and explored.

So you will know who you truly are. For example if your boss is leave and they are looking for a new replacement for his/her position and you have knowledge/idea about the job, but you decided embrace where you are because you are scared to take a step in life. And you also have the mind set that they will turn you down. Some people in college are comfortable having there master degree but scared to get their doctorate degree because they feel that having their masters degree is the stopping point of their learning skills and they are not smart enough to get their doctorare degree. Some enviroment make you satify where you at.

Being happy with where you at is not a bad thing but the more you explored the more you grow in life. Never be happy with who you are alway fight for a better future on a better life. like Neil Armstrong Said "" a gaint leap for man kind"" some people need to take that gaint leap in their life.

One enjoyable thing to do at the park is, you can walk our dog. While you are walking your do, you are also getting some exercise by walking with them. It's also fun because the dog can explore new places to go to.

Also it's somewhere you can take your dog to go out and enjoy nature with you. Some dogs like walking, so a park is a good place to take them to go walk. Also you and your dog can have some time together.

Another enjoyable way to do at the park is, you can have a picnic with your family of friends. Having a picnic is fun because you get to talk to the person with you and eat with them. Having picnics at the park can be good for example, the weather when it is hot or warm or it is a beautiful day outside. When you are done with your picnic you can go and explore more of the park. If you brought someone with you and they never been there before then they might like it and they would want to come back again.

Third enjoyable way to do at the park is, some parks have animals you can look at. It is enjoyable to look at the animals for example, the bears, fishes, turtles, goats, chickens, and pigs. You can also go look at the pig races. There could be some animals you may have never seen before. Sometimes when you go see the animals at the park some people can tell you some stuff to learn about the animal like where is is from or what it eats and you can feed the animal food that the park provides them to eat.

Last but least, you can ride your bike, stake board, and scooter. At the park you can learn how to ride the the thing you brought and practice. The park is also a safer place because there won't be a lot of cars. While you are riding on what you brought with you, it is fun to ride it while you see the beautiful features of the park. It is a good place to go and play with your friends with bikes, skate boards, and scooters because the park is safer than the street and might be a big park to play at with your friends.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5

First acts of kindness has an impact on others because others may not be used to being kind to everyone around our environment.

Next showing kindness to other people is not something everybody does on a daily bases however that does not mean we hate each other we just don't show what kindness really looks like.

Finally it's not always good to be kind to others because other people like to be treated good or bad.

Kind isn't always the best choice.

First being kind isn't always the best choice in different situations. For example picking if a student should get bullied or choosing a friend for you to help on the test like who would a help.

Next kindness can also lead you to big trouble. For example u standing up for a student who gets hurt and bullied by the bully if your school has no cameras around it's easy for the bully to lie about the situation that happened with the kid who got bullied if there are no cameras in your local school.

Finally about the bullying part the person who is getting bullied by the bully and the person who is standing up for the kid who gets bullied they can even get in trouble for interfering.

Don't be kind to those who aren't good people

First students and others who are being mean to you they are probably not a good person therefore don't talk to them and shouldn't be kind to them.

Also a reason to not be kind to those who aren't good people is because they have the discipline to teach themselves to treat others right.

8DD09D4FCD4F,"Is attending classes from home by way online of videoconferencing a favorable method for students to study?

Attending to classes from home by way online or videoconferencing is not a highly recommended way to study, because students will not have the same learning that they have while they are at school. If attending classes from home becomes a common way to study, students will not have the opportunity to build strong friendships with the other students around them, nor with the teachers. Also is not a recommended way to learn because students may not take their courses serious as they do in school because of the instructions of their teachers, or the advice of the counselors, or administrators of school.

In the first place attending classes from home is not the same has being is school, because at school students take their homework, quizzes and exams more serious that they can do at home. When students are in class and they have any question about the topic that they are learning of the can freely ask their teacher and the teacher will give them a clear explained answer and examples in order for students to understand everything they are teaching them. In addition, if students attend to classes online they will not have the opportunity to stay after school for extra help, or to retake a quiz or exam, nor to attend to a learning center to have other students helping them with their homework; or to just study with the company of another student. As a matter of fact, student's grades will decay due to not having all their questions answered, and their problems being solved.

Secondly, if attending classes online becomes a common way to study, students will not practice their communication skills by not building relationships with their classmates, not discussing their concerns with their classmates, nor just having fun with their friends during lunch ship. They would not feel the same way because at school sometimes students get inspired by other students, they see other students not just as their classmates but also as their friends, they could even see each other as family, therefore, students with the time get to see the school as another home where they know they have people that could help them with school stuff, but also can give them personal advice, as counselors and teachers do. Moreover, when students are receiving classes online at home, they will feel bored, and also lonely because they will not have anyone to discuss their questions or doubts with. In addition, in our present a large percent of teenagers are dealing with psychological problems such as; stress, anxiety, and depression; being at school distracts teens from their problems at home or even at their jobs, and it is a great way to receive help and advice from people willing to help them; such as school counselors, teachers, and friends. Being in school is better rather than being at home alone just studying.

Lastly, attending classes online is not the best idea for students who tempt to not take their studies seriously. While they are at home they wont feel the presence of a teacher standing next to them telling them to get their work done, or asking them to pay attention, and to not fell asleep during class. Also they will not feel the obligation to do their homework, in order to turn it in the following day. When students have to work in groups they learn lots of things from the teammates that they did not before, is a awesome way to inspire each other, and also to have fun, as students see other students work hard for their goals they do it too; but if these students are working alone they do the complete opposite. Therefore, this kind of students will think that they can do what they want and they wont take their courses in the serious way they have to be taken.

In conclusion, attending to classes online is not a favorable way for students to learn because they will not learn the same way that they do while in school. The students will not work on their communication skills, nor their social skills. In addition, students will not take their courses with the grade of seriousness they have to be taken.

8F78E9AF1D0E,"Do you challenge yourself often? In this society today do you think we challenge ourselves by making harder goals or easier goals? Michelangelo had stated a quote that proves how society is today and how we set goals we know we can achieve rather than set harder ones and give up when its not accomplished as quickly as you thought it would be. For instance, it can be the littlest things that you wouldnt realize such as, doing your bed in the morning is challenging but you know you can do it so you make your bed every morning.

Furthermore, Setting easier goals that you know you are capable of achieving gives you an opportunity to continue to create more and more goals as time goes by. When you accomplish something it makes you feel like you can do many more things leading to something bigger. For example, when you study for a test and you take the test the next day then later received an amazing score you challenge yourself to study every night before a test rather than take a risk and challenge yourself to study the same day as the test because you think you would remember it better.

We give ourselves goals we know we can achieve and play it safe rather than challenges because its easier. Such as, knowing your limits and knowing what youre capable of accomplishing. For example,

you would rather do something you already know instead of doing something you have no idea what to do in and no longer enjoy it therefore, you stick to what you know you would enjoy by knowing your limits.

Finally, Giving yourself a harder goal and not achieving it frustrates you and can cause you to give up on your goal. When you dont know how to do something it's frustrating and you just give up for example, In the movie frozen Elsa was forced to keep her powers a secret and to no longer use them but she tried using them and froze Anas heart because she was frustrated. Elsa tried to challenge her self and try to use her powers but since it was so difficult she got overwhelmed and started hurting people

In conclusion, People prefer to set easy goals that they are able to achieve because it inspires you to continue to do multiple goals instead of one challenging one that you know is to hard. People need to realize that its okay to have many goals instead of one big challenge goal that can make you lose interest in things ",3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5

First and foremost, I want this job because I could truly be happy. I love working by myself because I would get to work at my own pace and not have to worry about slowing down for others. And I really feel this is a good way of helping to get justice without getting in the action. For example I could help the police catch criminals by helping with fingerprinting. And thats why I feel I could be happy with that job.

Additionally, I would take that job because I would always get to be around the police force. And I admire them so much for their courage and bravery. something that we have in common is that we both want to help people. One time i saw someone take someones purse and the police officer chased him and pinned him down and returned the purse. The way I see police officers is that they love to help other people.

My opinion about this change is a good idea. But also many students have a grade of a (C) or lower it would not be a good idea changing the policy sport grade for those students. For others this policy my be a good idea because that way students that love sport's can start doing much better in school and have better grades. A, (B) or higher is a good grade so that way they can play a sport they like.

Teachers would probably accept this policy so that way their students will pay more attention. This change would not effect much but for students who don't study this idea might not be good, and might fill bad because they love sport's but can't play them for having to not pay attention or do your work at home.

Instead we should vote to see if we like this policy or not so we wont have to pass thru all this stuff of the policy changing. A fact about students here in SCHOOL_NAME would choose not to accept this new school policy because the old policy is u can't have more than three (F) and i would say the old policy is better than the new one our principal want to change it to.

He told me to read some of the doctor books at this age and then when I get to my senior year, that's when he told me to think about becoming a doctor. How my uncle become a doctor is he going to medical school for 7-8 years, but I want to be different from him, I want to become a surgeon and a doctor. My uncle is just a doctor, but he still works for surgeons but dosen't do actual surgery to people. My uncle was the one who got me most interested becoming a doctor.

I would mostly become a surgeon than a doctor because I read mostly about surgeries and it get me even more interested. Surgery is not that disgusting when you get used to it, that's why I read alot of surgeon books. When I first thought of surgery, I thought it was really disgusting, but then my uncle told me alot about it, then I stopped the disgusting part. My favorite part about surgery is fixing people, I feel happy that i'm fixing the person. The main reason why I want to become a surgeon is because I want to get alot of money to take care of my family, and I want to help people in life.                  ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
90E5BB6CBE11,"I personally think that student should chose there on summer projects because is not going to be as much fun if a teacher choose it. I dont think students are going to do there summer project if is something boring. If student do something there interesting on they are going to do research and finish there project on time because went summer hits not many student are interesting on doing work. I think that is going to be fun doing something i like and not something the teacher wants us to do.

If student do a summer project about just studient animals look for there behavior, some student mite think is fun. They would be some student that is going to be boring or they won't go out as much and not see animals at all. I think student should just pick the topic they think is going to be fun for them and they are going to enjoy reaching about whatever they want to learn. Teacher can grade something interesting not some boring work they tell us to do. i think even the teacher can have fun reading all the thing we come up with in the summer is just going to be fun for student and teachers.

I think teacher would be even happier if student do something they are going to get the benefits of it maybe a student wants to learn about how to treat a open cut or how to save the world from pollution. That would be something interesting that a student can learn about and who knows it mite come in handy and same the world from pollution and treat open cuts because your mom or friends got a dip cut in the house or in school. I just think is a way to learn about something you want not what the school wants us to learn.

I think this is a good way to make all the students to learn something they enjoy doing. You are going to do a interesting project the you are going to like and is just fun to learn new things. you are going to learn even more by doing something fun.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.0,2.5

925DBAC486E5,"Have you ever thought about finishing high school early? Not every student wants to finish school in four years. The reasons high school students would want to do this is to reach their career early or they have personal matters that make them want to leave early. To some teens going through with the program could be a difficult task. It is a good idea for teens to take the three year program, because they are trying to accomplish their goals early.

Not all teens want to spend all four years of high school. Their reason could want to move on to college after those three years. Another reason to why students want to finish is because they could have problems at their school. High school has bullying and other issues that could leave them with no choice but to want to take the three year program. There are teens in high school that want to join the work force at a young age.

The three year program has a lot of good benefits for students, but its not an easy thing to do. Students would have to take extra classes, which means more work. This would mean students will have to take extra math, science, history, and english classes. For the electives the students would probably have to switch them out with core classes. For highschool teens who do this program would have no time to slack off and would have to work had achieve their goal of finishing in three year.

In the three year program you are given choices on how you would like to do youre work. There are schools that could let you take the program through online. Students could also have the choice of taking the work over the summer right after school goes on break. High schools that have this program are giving students a huge benefit. it is a good idea for teen s that are taking a three year program to advance quicker to their future goals.",3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
92FFB3530304,"I'm disagree with this statement, that the first impression is impossible to change, because, I have seen a lot of people who doesn't had a positive impression at first, but later they completely changed. They become to change themselves from what they were before, tried to forgot about the negative impressions they had before.

if you Have a negative impression at first, and you want to change it, it will be hard, but it is not impossible, if you really want to change it. Everything that you have control of them, and you want to change them, you can do so. It well be hard, but not impossible. First impression can also have a large effect in someone's life, if it is a positive impression it can lead to the success, they want to have, but having a negative impression will not only take away your success, but it will also keep you down in your society, you will not have the respect, that you want have in your society. For example; if a boy in a place or society have a negative impression, other people who live in there will not let their children s to play with him, or to go to school together, or even their parents will try to change their children s classes if they know that they are in the same class, because they don't want their children to be like him, or to have a negative impression that he has. As the boy grows up, and recognize that he should change the negative impression that he had at first, which kept him away from his friends or classmates. He will try to change it to positive impression, which will be hard and for him it will be a strange thing, because he never tried this before, but, as he continues he will realize that, how much he was bad with that negative impression, and how much he was hurt, by that negative impression. Having a negative impression at first, and changing it will take much time, but changing this will help you to reach where you want, it will help you to achieve your goals, and it will help you to find a good friends, everyone will try to be your friend, and wants to have a good relationship with you, so you not only help yourself, but you will also help your friends to reach their success or to achieve their goals. Changing the first impression is not impossible for those who have a strong trust on theirselves, and really want to change this, especially, if this impression is negative, because he knows or soon he will know that this can be very bad for him, and can keep him down in school, society, or in the place they live. As, he knows that how much a negative impression will hurt them, they will try to change it. It is not going to be easy, but that doesn't mean that it will be impossible. In the process of changing this impression they will also learn a lot of new about how much will a positive impression good for them what can a positive impression do for them. They will know that having a positive impression is not in everyone's luck, those who have a positive impression, on their society, school or etc will have a successful future. Most of the peoples want to change their first impression, because they haven't seen any positive result from it; they want to change it for a good future. Those who have negative impression can't reach their success, because having a negative impression is like a wall between you, and your success, that will prevent from you achieving your success. First impression is like the first step toward your goals, so if you have a negative impression it will be almost impossible for you to get there, because having this impression can also effect your lessons, but if you have a positive impression it will be much easier to get there, because you can have more success in your lessons. For most of the people changing their first impression looking impossible, because they are never going to try it, they never want to experience a new thing, or maybe most of them think that this is not that important, but, I think that first impression is also very important in life. It can bring a lot of changes on you it can change you future, your position in a place.

I think that those who want to change their first impression should know that, this will not be easy, but if they try, and keep this in mind, that if they bring this change in their life they actually achieve a very big success. Changing this show them that everything that they want to change in their life is up to them, however, it will not be easy to do that, but that doesn't mean that it is impossible. Everything in your life is in your control, and you are the only person that can change what ever you want to change in your life, it just depends on you, that you are going to handle the situation. If a thing come to your life, and you know that, it will have a negative impression on your life try to keep them away, because they can make problems for, they can pretend you from having a good future, they will try to destroy you, so you are the only person who can keep all these things away. For most of the peoples it will be hard to forgot about their first impression, because they have a good knowledge with that, and they think it is good even if it is a negative impression. This kind of people will have a hard time to forgot their first impression. When we try to find new friends we always try to find about their impressions in our life; how can they help us to solve our problems, or how can they help us to achieve our goals. Having friends with positive impression in life will help you to take over your problems easily, but if you have friends with negative impressions, they can put their own negative impressions on you too, they will make think like a loser, because they don't want to reach your success.

In my idea those who want to change their first impression, first they have to think why they want to change it, what negative result they have seen with this impression, after they reached the position to change their first impression, they should start working for. ",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
9392E2E0AA1E,"I agree with the writing ""

Determine never to be idle

"" buy Thomas Jefferson. I agree with this writing because it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing something. the second reason that I agree is that I think we can accomplish more if we are always doing something. Lastly but not less I think that inactivity also can serve a purpose.

The firs reason that I agree with Thomas Jefferson writing because it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing some thing. What I think Thomas Jefferson was tring to say was that if we help others we wold be doing a lot for others. For example if we see someone that is tring to cross the street and they cant do it by them self because of a bad weather or because that person has a disability you should help that person because belive it or not you would make that person day. I also belive that Thomas Jefferson writing stans out for those people that dont have a home or a family y that can suport them if you can try to make that person day better by getting them a some water or food. I also belive by bing nice to people you could make there day better because you dont know if that peson had a bad day at work or something bad hapen.

Seconly I agree with THomas Jefferson writing because we can accomplish more if we are always doing some thing. For exampel if you are tring to pass a class or a SOL try your best and no matter how much you fell get up and get up stronger and keep tring. I think it also meen that is that if you are working and you dont know how to do it ask for help like that the next time you do it you can do it better. I think Thomas Jefferson was tring to tell us not to givre up.

Lastly but not less I belive that inactivity also can serve a purpose. Inactivity also can serve a purpose because if some one is provoking you and you jump up and keep it going then there can be some problems. For example if you are at work and some one provoke you and you reack to the provoke you could lose your job. If you get in troble because some one you and you keep the problem going it can afect you later on when you going to get a new job because they going to see that you cant control your self. Thats why i think if you go an talk to your boss when some one is causing you problems is better if you react an you lose your job for not contlroling your self.

In conclution I think we should help any one that needs the help and not just think that they would be fine because we dont konw what they been throug and we would like for some one to help us when we are in troble or when we are not dong well.    ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0
93DF867BE1C5,"I am agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the persuit of success .The Success consists of going to faillure to faillure without loss of enthusiasm. Next the success consists in many things. For example the Prime Minester Wiston Churchill said that, because he always persuade . That the enthusiasm is it the most important to any business or personal in your life consist in that simple word.

First I think that prompt has a specific message that persuasive that everyone who read can reading the message. So if who read the prompt may perform their success and should not failure in the future business. Next the futere business can thinking about it. Then if they don't have any enthusiasm they won't have success in a not very far away future. Finally that is what I think about the prompt said Churchill's statement very important role that failure plays in the success.

First I think it is very important that statement role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. Second if you persist and never give up you should be successful. Also if you are not persisting what you want with enthusiasm. That means you will have the same situation going to failure in your live. Then finally never loss the enthusiasm that is the point for all success.

For the success if you are unwilling have a little enthusiasm. So, as you are trying to do and you fail. It's only one reason that was not enough enthusiasm to doing it. You have to preform and trustly in yourself.

Also I think that success is for who are looking and persist with enthusiasm. Finally that is the enthusiasm consists in the future.

The important role from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I am agree with that statement said, you never think you cannot do anything. Also I think if you feel without enthusiam you always will failure. So if you purpose is the success you should hard work and don't feel you cannot. Then if you willing you won't failure.

9523FBA791BE,"Imagine yourself getting out of high school early, and going to college or the workforce. It's really exciting because all that hard work was worth it, and you made it, but to get through you had to give up many of the activities you liked as well as your time. That is why it's not a good idea for students to finish high school in three years, and enter college or the workforce one year early. Students must take classes during the summer. Many students may not be able to take elective classes. Finishing early can be very stressful for students.

Students finishing high school in three years must take classes during the summer or in the evenings. Many students work over the summer, and having to take classes would not give them time to get a job. Instead, students would have to attend to school, do homework, study for tests, and quizzes. Similarly, if students take classes in the evenings, and want to be enrolled in sports, or clubs, which require students to stay after school. They would not be able to participate.

If students finish high school early, they may not be able to take elective classes. In order for students to graduate, they have to take required classes. This required classes are also important when getting into a college. Having to take all the classes they need, can barely fit into their schedules. This would enable students to be enrolled in elective classes like art, drama, music, or photography.

Some people may say that students finishing high school in three years, and enter college or the workforce one year early, it's a good idea. However, it can be very stressful for students. Students have to study for all of their classes, do homework at home, and keep up with their classwork, so they won't get behind. Additionally, students have to do projects, and presentations. All of these can stress students a lot, and won't have time for their own.

It's not a good idea for students to finish high school, and enter college or the workforce one year early. Students would need to take classes during the summer or in the evenings. Students would not be able to take elective classes. Also, finishing one year early can be stressful for students.

953BEF800163,"Finish high school one year early sounds pretty good. Students can start doing something out of high school that helps them in the career they will choose in the future. But, its better to finish the traditional four years in high school, because students can prepare more they self before go to college, its too early for students to finish high school at the age of 15-17 years old, and students might not have the enough education that they need.

To begin with, students will be more prepare to go to college after the four years of education from high school. They can prepare more they self and see what they need to work on or what they wanna do in the future. For example, these four years in high school helped me to find a passion about what I would like to become in the future, and also helped me to be more mature and feel ready for the next step.

Also, its too early for students to finish high school one year before, because students might be in the age between 15-17 years old and they may not be that ready to start a responsive life in college. For example, my sister is 16 years old and she's a junior. When we don't have nothing to do or we are having a conversation, I always ask her if she is ready to go to college or at least, if she have an idea of what major she would like to study and her response is that; she's not even ready for her senior year, and I understand her, because that happened to me when I was her age and when I was a junior.

Moreover, students might not have the enough education that they need to learn in high school, and that can be a problem in their classes in college. For instance, I've heard from some friends in college, that sometimes they really lost in some classes, even though they graduated from high school when they were 18 years old. That means, if students graduate in three years, they would be confusing in their classes when they're in college.

To conclude, graduate in four years from high school it feels longer, but it will be a big reward at the end, because students will be more ready to go to college, also they will be in an age where they will be more responsible, and mature. Lastly, they will have more acknowledge in everything. High school, its one of the best step of your life, where after you graduated from there, you would like to come back and stay more than four years.",4.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5
95FD6DF25420,"Hi my name is Generic_Name and I am going to talk about energy and resources. The reason why we are talking about energy and resourses is because ,some busineses have adopted a four day work week. They want to because they want to conserve energy and resourses.

Each work week is going to be for 10 hours but in my opinon that is not going to work. I think it is not going to work because, people are barely working 8 hour shift and working 10 hour shifts. It is going to be more painful for people, and they are going to get really tired. In my opinion if they are going to make people work for 10 hours for 4 days, they have to increase the minumim wage and pay a little bit more money.

Their is alot of reason why I do not agree with this new change. The only positive reason I see is getting 3 days off. Another positive reason I see for this change is, if you get payed every 2 weeks, and you worked

4 days and, make 40 hours 1 week and 40 hours another week, it is going to be a good paycheck. Now it depends how much you get payed but im pretty sure if you are going to do 10 hours shifts, they are atleast going to pay $12.00 an hour or they are going to pay you $11.00 dollars in hour. Those would be good reasons to work in a job like that. It depends to if the people have time to work 10 hour shifts for 4 days.

Their are some school that want to have those same rules that some jobs have of 10 hours. I do not think that would work for students, because 10 hours of being in school is really stressing. I know how it feel like to be in school for 8 hours, is it is not fun and it is really stress full. I think that the classes in highschool would be more longer the students would not concentrate .The reason they would not concentrate is because, you would be doing a lot of asighnments and, you would lose intrest in what they are teaching and, you would lose focus. In my opinion I would not like that but I am pretty sure the school would like it because, they would be completing more work and they would be finishing lessons really quick and the students would study more.

There would be another advantage to that because the students would be in school for 10 hours for 4 days a week. They would have 3 days off every week that in my opinon it would propably be friday saturday and sunday. It would sound kind of good since you get 3 days off every week, but at the same time no students want to be in school for 10 hours for 4 days a week ,that sounds stressing and hard .You would propably have more classes, a lot of home work ,and more test, and quizes. It would propably be hard for teachers to do 10 hour shift to because ,they would have to do more planings of lessons because they would propably have to teach lot of classes during the day since the school day is 10 hours.

In my opinion this prompt that I wrote today was really intresting. The topic was really intresting it made me think a lot of what I was going to type in this prompt. The topic was really intresting because it was about what I thought about jobs only working 4 days a week and 10 hour shifts. The other part of the topic was what if school was 4 days and 10 hours. This prompt made me put myself in that position and I did not like it if this would ever happen in real life I would be against it .               ",3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,3.0,3.0

First, first impression are possible to change when you are making new friends at new school because people can look at you by the way you are quite, shy, and serious. But once they start to get to know you they start realizing that you are talkative, loud, and fun to hangout with. Their first impression of you starts to change. For example, when I met Generic_Name I thought she was ignorant, rude, and selfish but when I started to hangout with her I noticed that she was a sweet and caring girl. And we became really good friends even my first impression of her from the beginning changed.

Second, first impression are possible to change when you go to an interview at work because when you arrive at the interview it may seem that don't have the courage to work by the way you act. Meanwhile those impressions start to change because they notice that you actually want to work and you want to put an effort on the job. For example, When I went to an interview for a job the manager thought that I didn't actually wanted to work and that I wouldn't take it serious just by the way I look. Later on he realized that I actually wanted the job even that I would take it serious. In other hand some people think that by the way I talk or my face impression, people think that I won't get the job because I would not take it serious but they are wrong because once they start to get to know me. They start realizing that I actually want the job.

In conclusion, first impression are actually possible to change when people are making new friends at school and when you get an interview for job because we need to get to know each other better, instead of letting our first impressions be right.

I think it is a good idea to extending the school day two hours to a four days school week, but one reason that I agree with this opinion is that the student could more time to do their homework and they could work too. The schools could save more energy if we go to school 4 days per week because we used a lot of energy during school day. Many students have babies they have to care them when they are out of school this option can be benefits for this students how have to be parents and students in the same time I love this school where i am because they help the students who do not have who can care their kids.

In my point of view this option can help me and the rest of the students too, because we could do a lot of things in that day for example I have to work after school because i have to pay my rent, food, clothes and other things that a person need and If I only came only four day in the week I could work all the day and make more money to help my mom.

I agree with the businesses who only open

4 days in the week because they want to save energy and money, For example when i was in mu country my family and I always saved energy because we don't had the money to pay the energy, sometimes I forget to turn off the TV and my mom yelled me and said ""turn off the TV because you don't pay the energy."" and sometimes i get mad because i wanted to listed music and watched TV.

Some students have to do many things in the same time for example they have to be parent, student, and labor and the week is to short to them to do all the things and a day off can be so good for them because it's not easy to anyone to be responsible. I admire my mom because she was dad and mom for my and my brothers and I was think how can she do all those things and then I realized that she wake up everyday because she want the best for us and doesn't matter how tired she felt. We can't ""never give up"" because fighting.

In conclusion, I agree that the schools extending the school day two hours and we came only 4 days on the week because sometimes we feel tired and we can rest one day in the week because we have to work in the weekends too and the school can be beneficial too because they can save energy, food, water, money and a lot of other things.

It can also impacted students to finish their goals and became better person in the future. Some student don have that kind of privilege as some students have to all subject so they can graduate from high school to go to college. That what make some students dropping out of high school, because they think they are not smart enough or some students cant afford to pay for some school supply.

I think it is a good idea for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. First, it can make learning fun for students and they can enjoy what every career they what in future. Second, it can impacted students to go to school learn instead for skipping school making them falling their classes. Third, students should be expected to take a career that make them happy and want to do and they are also willing to do, also achieve their goals. example for students to like the idea of identify, is to prepare them college and some may not go to college and start working.

Inclusion students should chose a career the like and love. If they study the career they like their be less drop out of high school. They can also be success on what ever they can achieve in life. Also help them to a great future and everything is possible, however, I think that is a good idea for students to commit to a career a young age and to also help them became better person and make good chooses.

Why someone might find that activity enjoyable?, i will explain and give specific details.

As we all know that parks provide many activities for us. One enjoyable activity is playing soccer ,You don't need to have good skills to play soccer. Many teens play soccer or they are in a soccer team , because they enjoy it. I know there is a lot of enjoyable activities , but i chose soccer. I play soccer with my friends and family , we really find it enjoyable to go outdoors and have some fun together. Many kids don't like going outside because they think sports are boring , But they aren't boring to me. In the summer time parks are open for you to enjoy activities with your kids and family.

Your kids will enjoy playing soccer with their friends outdoors. Many parents don't let their kids go places with their friends , because they think something bad might happen to them.

Meanwhile , many kids like to play other sports that are different than soccer , but they still enjoy it. Soccer is the same as many sports kids do at school or at parks. Teens spend their time at parks playing many sports during the summer time. My family go to parks to enjoy the water and play games that they never played before. If i enjoy playing soccer i think you will too , why not have some fun and probably hurt ,but hope that doesn't happen to anyone. You feel free when you play a sport you like to play or you might want to try a new sport. Always try something new because there isn't a lot of time to enjoy moments like that.

Also,I think someone might find playing sports enjoyable , because it's fun playing outdoors with your family or friends. We have two seasons that we can play outdoors and you will enjoy it. Also parents will enjoy spending time with their kids. Why not take time out your day so you can spend time with your kids more.

In my conclusion one way you could have an enjoyable time outdoors is playing sports. why not go outdoors and have some fun with your friends. Enjoy the time you have with your family and friends , imagine if something happens that causes you to not go outdoors. You might not like going outside ,but do it for you and your own health. Outdoors can also help you get stress out and excise your body more. Enjoy the time you have to enjoy with your family.

98D8FF9E3C56,"The life is being more modern, people also need to improve themselves. That's why some schools want to offer some programs which are good for students. Some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. Most students who allow this plan must take courses during the summers or in the evenings or may not be able to take elective courses.

This plan has two positions,some people agree, but others don't think it's a good idea. Is it a good idea? It is. It is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early if the students want because they can save time, they can have new experiences, new challenges which help for their life in the future, they still can take elective courses also have vacations latter after college or work if they want.

Let's start with the first reason now. Do you agree that the time is limit? The time is the only thing you can't move back. Because of this, a lot of people, especially students are thinking how to spend time helpful. These programs will help many students save time. They can save one year in school, that also means they can reach success early one year. Many people spend summer having vacations to relax, and evenings watching TV, but the other people spend this time studying. They choose have more time after success instead of have time when they haven't had anything.

The next reason will be the reason help students the most. Most students who follow this plan will have a lot of experiences also challenges because they must have the same knowledge in shorter time than, they will have pressure, but it will grow up ourselves. They can become stronger, independent by working on own and have more information about lessons because this time is not enough for teachers can teach everything, they must research more.

The last reason refers to elective courses. Many students like these courses, but some students don't. These programs do not require to take elective courses, so some students can skip these course which they don't like or do not helpful for their career. They also take these courses after college or work if they want. They can choose also consider what is they need. Moreover, this plan don't require you skip these elective courses, you just may not be able to take these, so if you want to take courses, you can plan for this. It depends on your choice.

On the other hand, many students do not agree this plan. They think it gives stressful for them, they worry about they cannot have enough lessons. But if you think that it means you don't confide your ability also don't try for your future. Sometimes, the life needs challenges to grow up and it will be interesting. To enter college or the work, all we need are knowledge or skill, not how long we took them. You can choose your way, success will come soon or later depends on you.

Conclusion, we should support some schools offer these programs that allow high school students to graduate early if they can. Our life will change if we change, our success will come if we try, and it will happen early if we have a plan. After all, which one do you agree with? It is a challenge but many students can do. However, it will be fair if students can choose take or not these programs.

There making everything so easy for us this year they will do 3 years of high school if I studying really hard to not stay for all 4 years by that addition they will be including to have courses during on summers or in evenings or may not be able to take elective courses. Which will be really helpful for me to have more hours to myself more of my free time I could studying way more to. More than I knew about these prgrams im glad I found about it because it can be a big change for me and everybody else. It's a 50 50 deal to me because your going to miss on 1 year ,but also you can do so much go apply to colleges and have a job because you would have more time for all the better thats coming to you.

On the outcome you would be helping yourself out spend your summer on school time or you can have less hours of going to school on evenings sleep in more in the miday. All 4 years you can be doing the total of 3 years you would just be doing fulltime but it's also the choice you make on evenings or in the summer days. Luckily you can do anthing what you want and could imagine if you can put your mind to it and it will appear better days. Although everything in life you will get because its how you want your future to be but if it's for you it will not go away. At any age you can graduate young or as a older person but when you do you will be a successful leader.

My main priority in life is school since I was a child I always love coming in to school it was always my focus in life to overcome the end of it. School has always been my favorite because you saw your friends and it's how you start your day also good connection than having a studying buddy to make everything work. A high school deploma is your way to the next door it's access to everything you will ever need later on to your future. After your done high school you will be feeling as a pot of gold apply in purssure and you will get there apply to many awesome colleges and now that you have time you can have a job.

Its a little creepy in all honesty but its the world we live in where people just wanna fit in and act normal to seek comfort and approval from someone else even when they dont need. another reason i do not agree is cause this generation prefers technology over human contact so its easy to see why they dont go their own path but instead they prefer to just follow the crowd and not follow what they want its mind blowing how we gotta take an sol too just to see if you smart when all you can do is just sit in a class and listen to a student and see how smart they are without a dummy boy test but im just a young student whos following the crowd just to get a diploma even tho at this point a diploma will barley take you far but it looks good on resume so thats why i am doing this exact test to follow the crowd of dead students just trying to graduate for a family that dont even care if im dead or alive as long as i got a diploma ",3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0
9B69DE203555,"When asking for advice, 93% of the people in America talk to more than one person. I think seeking multiple opinions will help you make a better choice rather than asking one person for advice.

It could also help you out with other situations through out life. This is why you should talk to more than one person when asking for advice, you can get other peoples opinions, the way others understand your situation, you can see situations differently.

When you talk to more than one person to ask for advice you can get other peoples opinion. Everyone you know thinks differently. Sometimes people may have some of the same thoughts but not every situation has the same solution. What one person has to say is different from what another person says.

People understand things differently. Some people you talk to will not understand your situation. They will not see the situation the way you see it. If they do not completely understand your situation they could say the wrong thing. When they say the wrong thing it could make your situation a lot worse. You should always have multiple people you know you can trust and you could talk with to ask for advice in any situation. While others will know exactly what to say and do because they probably have been in situations like yours.

You can see other situations differently. When you talk to more than one person to ask for advice you start to see things differently. It changes the way you think about any situation. You will have an open mind and you will know what to say when other people ask you for advice. Knowing what to do when other people ask you for advice can help you out with a lot through life. It can help build stronger relationships and people can trust you. Trust is very important because people can talk to you about anything and you will know how to react and what to say.

In conclusion, talking to more than one person to ask them for advice can help you make the better choice. It can also help you out with other situations later in life.

9C601D9FCB5F,"Technology is an important thing in our lives at this moment and it will be more important in the future. Humanity always try to look forward for what is better for our lives and make everything more easier. While some people say this is a good thing, some people think it's bad for our lives because people stop interacting face-to-face in public, they don't want to get out of the place where technology is at, and some might have an agressive behaivor when they told them technology is bad for them.

In the past people always met in the street, there was no technology were with a single ring we can saw our friends into a little screen and talk to them. Now, this problem became a bad thing in our society, people don't go outside to meet friends, or just enjoy how the city looks, they prefer to stay at home and talk to people that they don't know who they are. Some of these people might say that there's no difference when they talk to a stranger online because we used to talk strangers in the street;however, there's a risk when you talk to this people online and it's the fact that some of them used fake accounts to hack personal information and other things. When we used to meet strangers in the street, we saw how they behave and what they're doing, and that's how people made friends in the past, saw how they act and behave,but now Internet is the key of making a friend that we don't know if it's real.

When we were kids it was all fun to play outside: in the streets,going to a friends house, or even going to the park with them, but now things have change a lot since we were those kids who played in the streets. Now with the new technology people made video games, and now is the popular thing between kids and teenagers. All we have to do is to connect the device to the TV and just play, but some people play the whole day and they don't want to go outside to play any sport, or going to a friends house. When they go to school the most common topic between every kid is about video games, and that can affect their lives because playing all the time won't help anyone to study for an important test,or doing their homework. In the past when they created the first console it was a wonderful thing, but some kids didn't have the enough money to buy it, so instead of save money for a tiny console, they save money to eat something like an ice cream, a burguer, and go to attraction parks,but now we can see how the kids and the teenagers from now don't want to get out where technology is at.

Due to the amount of technology we have now develop, a new behaivor where if we prohibited them to use technology, they reach to the point where they become agressive. Families have issues when their kids became agressive just because the prohibited the use of technology, and this reaction is trendy right now in different parts of the world. Some doctors said that the reason why they react like that is because they are in an imaginary world where they can do whatever they want, until the parent try to take apart their""world"" to become a normal kid, but now that technology is in every single corner, it's hard to make a kid stop use technology. Even teenagers went to a ponit when they are playing video games they break everything they got on their sight, including the video game device that their parents bought for them.

Some people might say that technology is something positive in our live because we create artifacts that make our lives more simple;however, technology is bad in our lives because we stop acting like normal people and we want to make our lives more easy, and that can affect how our saciety can be in the future if we don't control the use of technology.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0
9C76CF46D791,"Students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. When students enter high school, they begin to work at a specific job to earn some money in order to be prepared for their future career.

It is not a good idea for students to commit to a specific career at a young age because it will cause distractions from school work, students are still getting education, and specific jobs will distract students from activities they enjoy.

Students should not commit to a career at a young age because it will cause distractions from school work. In high school, teachers and other faculties take education seriously and gets harder for students every year as they develop. Students get a lot of homework and tests they have to study for and need to focus on education in order to graduate from high school and get to a good collage. Spending time on a specific job before their actual career can distract students and decrease their grades. For example, a high school student goes to work at a salon after school but they have so much homework and a test to be prepared for, but they have don't have enough time to study and accomplish their homeworks since their specific job is in the way. So they begin to get a low grade and fail tests, which can also give them a low self-esteem.

Students should not commit to a career at a young age because are still getting education. High school students are still young and are still developing, they need to spend their high school years to study and get a good education in order to develop. In their high school years, students begin to get an idea of what they wish to be for their future career, so they are still learning about it and that's how they get a better amount of money, be well-educated, and live a good and healthy life. For example, high school student is not well-educated and is still developing, so they need to keep studying and learning in school to graduate and get to a good collage to study about their future career that interests them and the dream job they are wishing to work for. A specific career will take them away from their dream job.

Students should not commit to a career at a young age because specific jobs will distract students from activities they enjoy. It is important for students to do activites they enjoy to be healthy and have something positive and enjoyable to do. When they get a specific job during their high school years, it will take them away from these enjoyable and positive activities they and will have no time to do it when they have a specific career and school, which can also cause stress for students and will never find anything positive that they enjoy to do. For example, a student plays football and really enjoys it and it gives them positive energy. But they have to go to school and need time to do their schoolwork and study to pass. When they get a specific job, they don't have time to do their favorite activity and also not have enough amount of time to study and do schoolwork, which can cause stress to students.

In conclusion, students should focus on studying and education in high school and not get a specific career that will distract themselves from school or any activities they enjoy to just to get money. They have to keep developing and study hard to get to a good collage and be prepared for their dream job to get a good amount of money and live a better life.",4.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,5.0,4.0

First reason is there a lot of people in the world who has a lot of problems. so I think that this quote would light up there day and make them fell better. second reason is that people that dose not have any problems could save this quote in there brains and when they are facing a problem they could use it to help them through that time and to do better. lastly I think when Duke Ellington was going through trough times he used his own straghe to help him to do his best and not give up.

Next reason why you should agree with Duke Ellington is that when people have a lot of problems most of them just give up for example most people dose not have enough money to pay there bills some sell their house while others sell the cars and most people become homeless and live in the streets but if the hear this quote it might help them not to give up and do there best.

My final reason why everyone should agree with Duke Ellington quote is it's hard going through a problem because any thing can happen some people lose there jobs because of a problem.

I have other talents which are that I am good at sports like basketball ,softball,, track, and soccer. I been doing it seen's I was little my dad wanted my siblings to be out of the house instead of being on our phones so we had to learn to do sports.

The first one I learned is soccer because it's just kicking a ball and running . The cool part about soccer is doing the tricks and everything. Soccer isn't big as well know as it should be. In the middle east it's big but not like basketball or football the whole world loves those sports. Also in the England they call it football instead of soccer but I get it makes a perfect name for it because you just kick it with your foot.

The second one I learned was track it wasn't that hard because you run or jump. When running in the track it is not about winning because the wind is in your face and running and your mind goes blank it feels so good when you are stressed. The long jump is my favorite because when I jump it's like flying then I touch the ground and it is gone. That why running is my favorite it's not about beating the other person.

The other one I learned is I think it was basketball. basketball because it is a mystery if you make it or not you just shoot and hope you make it .Seeing basketball players on TV I think help me to be better just like them. The thing about is that the boys ad girls are separated because they think the boys are too rough for them the girls can be rough too but thats why they made the WNBA [woman national basketball assonstion]. In my school they have one for girls and one for boys but a lot of people come watch he boys one way more than the girls.

The next one is softball this one I just wanted to do something different when the other seasons are over. It was boring at first when you learn how to play it becomes a game not a sport. In school we have softball but we don't have baseball for boys but I wish we did I think is unfair that the girls have one but they don't.

9EAB766AF4BE,"Students and teachers have important roles in their life. The students need to pass the class in order to graduate and the teacher gets paid for doing his/her job. As long as the kids are not failing teacher has the job it is very key that students and teachers should be having good relationship. If the student ever needs help he or she can feel comfortable talking to the teacher and the teacher should be helping the students. If they need it because they can loose their job.

Lets say if the students decide to design the project there own. The only problem with that its going to be to easy for them. Also it wont challenge them so there brain will not learn anything and it will be useless. If it was a group project most of the kids would go with the smart people so they can finish it. And not worry about it and some of the lazy kids will cheat on the projects. If i was the parents i would tell them do it yourself and learn how to finish the project the right way and get a good grade.

Having the teacher design the project is way smarter. They will know what kind of project to create. And also if this was a group project it will be smart for the teacher to put some kids in the group because then the teacher can decide how many points it can be. And how long they have to finish plus the students dont do anything in there break myself being a student i can relate to that. But they have to learn something so when they do start school they will be one step of ahead of everyone. My personal opinion is that i probably wont do the assignment during break right away but i will finish before it ends whenever i have the time.

At the end of the day both teachers and students are trying to help each other out. And i think its more productive the teacher designs the project because when the teacher grades them or goes over them teacher can give feedback. Thats very important see what parts you did wrong or where you did good at. Having feedback can help you a lot but staying with the teacher to design the project is the best idea. Because the students can learn more and get more information on there project. And they will get good grades on them and it should be required to have teachers designing projects for the students.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5

I chosed this subject because me myself am an athlete in many sports such as basketball,football,swimming,and lacross which is why i feel as if i have a great connection with the subject of P.E since the platform of the class is physicle education which most of the time includes sports. This connection is established from the joy of physicle and fitness related activities that health/P.E can assure.

I find this activitie mostly enjoyable since it has some of the sports I play in after hours outside of school grounds,which builds a strong connection. I also enjoy the connection i make with others such as the other students and the teacher since health/P.E are mostly social based activities, were teamwork and cooperation are needed.

This is an art in which others and you could interact with each other which if to the right exstent can bring joy to those who socialize in educational manners, but with that also brings educational activities which is much more of important when it comes to P.E because education always comes first when it comes to any class in the education atmosphere. P.E may bring a positive inpact on others who need social activites to interact with others,which is what makes P.E enjoyable and impactful for me and much others.

I feel as if this interaction and connection in physicle education/P.E is a great enjoyable way inside of shool grounds that can provide a break from classes which you sit all day and study and is why i choose this as my topic of intrest when it comes to my oppinanated most enjoyable activity.

9F1CC7603B64,"I agree about that some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, the students can would benefit. One of the reasons are that I think this can be a more easy way for students to learn is because they cannot be distract to anothers students, so they can work with tranquility. Another reason is that the students can save a lot of time working online at home, because they don't need wait for the bus, or walk directly at the school.

For example, if you work at home, you don't need permission to use the bathroom, because you're at home, so you can use the bathroom anytime. Another example is that some times work in the school can be so noisily, also can be uncomfortable, but if you prefer to work online you get not problems because you can be more focus in your work, and also you can feel more comfortable working online.

Another example about why I think that working online is more benefit for students, is because they can have all the recourses, and tools necessary to work, also you cannot be feel bad about if you don't finish a test ,or a quiz at time in school, working online you ge all the necessary time to complete a test ,or a quiz, you can more time to do your homework, also you can eat everything that you want working online, in the school you cannot eat on classes time.

In conclution, working online is a more easy way for students to learn than working at the school, because had a good help and a lot of good reasons, and also a lot of good benefits. That's what I think that working online or video conferencing is a more easy way to lear for the students, and also I think is a big opportunity too.",3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0
9F27EAC1E27D,"How people live their life is up to them whether to follow their own decisions, or seek guidance from experts and authorities for life's important matters. People should make their own decisions because relying on others will make you less self-sufficient and you should develop your own self-identity not from the choices of other people, although some people may say that people who seek guidance from experts are smarter than people who do not.

People should be able to rely on their own decisions on life, so that they do not become less self-sufficient in the choices that they make. Firstly if you keep relying on others than you become someone who can not do anything on their own without the help of other people. Another reason would be that people might think you are unable to do simple tasks in life because you relay on other people too much. Lastly self-sufficiently is an important skill that everyone should have through-out their life. Your past choices defines who are you today, so if you relay on others too much than you become a different kind of person you once were

Other people who spend their whole life heavily relaying on other people develop no self-identity of their own. I highly doubt that Tesla or Einstein relayed on anyone if not no one on the work that they did. Additionally if you do not have a self-identity people will not remember who you are. Secondly if you always have people telling you the answers in life it is hard to live without those people who helped you in the first place. Finally always become a person who does not have to relay on others for the sake of your own well being. You should always listen to your brain and not seek out help too much, or it will affect your life in very bad ways

Still, some may say that people who seek help from experts are smarter than people who do not. That people who seek out help will be more informed in life, therefore they do not have to worry about the things they do not know. This may be true but it's better to find the answer on your own than to always ask for help from experts.

In the end you shouldn't rely on other people too much because it will be harder to be more self-sufficient and it will be harder to develop your own self-identity. People should be inclined to make their own decisions in life whether they like it or not.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.5,3.0,3.5

Some people believe that most of the people's personality will depends on their presentation or the way that dress up, they think that your knowledge or your personality is base on how you look. I believe that the first Impression could change for the following three reasons; Your clothes or how you look do not show your type of personality, the kind of person who you are will depends on knowing the person and through knowing the person your idea about the person could change.

The majority of people classify the type of person base on how they look, What I believe is that your clothes and how your look do not say or show your type of personality or the kind of person who you really are.

Base on my short experience to know a person takes time and the first impression could be unfavorable in strong relationships or friendships that's why I believe that who you are will depends on knowing the what kind of person you are.

Most of the strong friendships or relationships that I know they were enemies or they did have a good impression about the person at first time but through the time they had the privilege to know the person and they found a good kind of person.

9FE689F5F44D,"Achieving the knowledge based on the books or on the notebooks is common but achieving a knowledge by involving in the extracurricular activities is a different and extra. School is the place where students get suggestion, get inspire, and get strength to accomplish their goals. From school, students can learn optimum knowledge and experiences about the inside and outside of the books as well. In addition, school is the career building place for the students. School is the best place to evaluate the skills and the capability of each students. By controlling students involvement in the extracurricular activities, many students can fulfill their dreams which gives them happiness and makes them feel special by doing it. Also, gives them a wings of hope to do something more and make their parents and themselves proud tomorrow.

As we all know that, if the students doesn't have that ability and interest in order to take a particular class then school never force students to involve in those particular class or field. But, talking about family, there are maximum parents who force their children to take a class and choose a career as they want. There are many parents who wants their children to become a doctor, pilot or engineer; though, their children doesn't have any interest on that faculty. In other words, though their children are weak in math and science, but their parents wants to make them, a doctor, pilot or engineer. It's only because according to the parents, only doctor and pilot can make a huge money and has a great reputation. At this situation, we have seen many cases that parents do emotionally blackmail to their children. In that condition, children sacrifice their dreams just to make their parents happy. We all know, every student do not wants to become a doctor and pilot. They have their own dreams and interests on particular faculty. For example, if a student is interested and good on soccer but his parents do not support to his interest because they feel it's a waste of time. But, school always support him. According to the parents their children should be good on knowledge based on books rather than extracurricular activities. They should have only focus towards their study which is totally wrong.

If schools control student involvement in extracurricular activities then it can show a right path and right decision for the student's bright future. Schools are available with each and every information regarding the bright future of students. If a student is interested on an art then teacher let them to take that class with a huge strength.

School knows every skills and talent about their student because they spend more time with their teachers, counselor, friends and their coach than their family. In fact, they share everything about their interest to their teachers and counselors because they understand them. But they do not share those kind of things with their family because family gives only pressure instead of understanding their children's interest. If a student is good on photography then school is the only one who gives more information and put more efforts to help them through different strategies. They try very hard that how students will feel easy and comfortable. Students are also able to learn different knowledge through the school's coach. Coach is the only one who teach, tell and motivate students about their strong and weak point through which student can do better today and give their best tomorrow than yesterday.

School provides a beautiful and colorful feathers to the students in order to fulfill their dreams in which faculty they are interested and dying to do for it; only by controlling student involvement in extracurricular activities. There are many students who do not have any interest on their study, who do not have any interest on the words written on their notebooks, who do not have any interest to become a doctor, engineer or pilot. Instead, who are interested to become a famous photographer, to become a great dancer, singer and a great actor. These dreams will be remain on dream until they do not get any supports from anyone, if they do not get any motivators to motivate them and also if anyone won't become their inspiration to inspire and encourage them. Similarly, school is that place which do not give their student's dream remain on dream; school helps students to give all those things which are needed to them; by motivating, encouraging and being inspiration for the students. It also provides an elective classes and other different activities to make them feel happy and special or in order to let their colorful feathers fly in the high sky and able to touch and feel it.

At the end, we can see that there are many benefits for the students which also teach them about the importance of extracurricular activities. Therefore, school is that place where it motivate, gives a strong strength to accomplish student's passions, suggest students to go through their interest and teach many significance knowledge about the educational experiences. Because of the schools control student involvement in the extracurricular activities, students can accomplish their interests, dreams and make their career in a particular activity in which they are interested, in which they see a big hope, declare it as their passion and happiness. I believe that not only the students, everyone should follow their passions and see success will comes towards you itself because all we need is our happiness. It is only possible if the schools control students involvement in the extracurricular activities rather than giving decisions to the family and student for the involvement in the extracurricular activities.

A055576C0F9E,"My name is Generic_Name. I am going to take a position about self-reliance, whether or not about if should people make their own decisions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters. I honestly think that seek guidance from experts is better, because you can ask them about how they did to accomplish their goals and also they have more experience about life.

First, guidance from experts it can be much better, because experts can give more options, more ideas. Also you can ask them about what you need in life to be success. Also ask them about their life, how they did to accomplish their goals. Because if we are in any situation that we know we could not do it alone , we should ask them about any idea that they will give to us.

Second, those people they know almost everything about life, they could tell you whats steps you need to follow to achieve. As we know, billionaires people worked hard to be success, even if they failed something, even if life make them week, they never give up. they keep trying and trying until they make their dreams comes truth. thats why seek guidance is important for someone that want a better life.

Finally, in life we need help, even if we say that we dont need we need it. Because we can not do everything by our self. Thats why we should ask for help with people that can teach us about life. People that will give us tips to be success in life, because they have more experience and also because they know almost about everything.

A094036DE672,"I think that setting a curfew time for teenagers during the week and weekends is good because it's letting them know the time they can leave there house, and the time they so there parents wouldn't worry about them leaving in the middle of night just to go out with friends. If there weekday curfew is until 10pm then it's acceptable because it's a school night so they at least just go home after school, change, and go out with friends until 10pm. If they get home after 10pm then they are disobeying, and breaking the law which would get them in so much trouble so like the consequences would be go to court, talk with the judge, and know what there punishment would be either going to be on prohibition for 2 weeks, having an ankle bracelet so if they try to sneak out it would alert an officer then they would immediatly would be put in juvenile detention center for a week, and if those consequences don't work then they would be offically be put with an officer to take him to school, home, and work so they don't try to sneak out again. The weekend curfew would be all day until 12am. this curfew time is only set only fridays and saturdays. If they come back home after 12am then there are gonna be actual real more serious consequences like being on house arrest, be on prohibition with an officer watching you, taking you to where you're supposed to be if any of those dont work then they will just be locked up in a Juvenile detention center for 4 weeks so they would actually have no freedom only time is when they get visitation time with there parents visit, and when they are released from that place.

A18B82F7407B,"When you first meet a person for the first time, it is good to have a positive attitude towards the person so that they see a good impression of yourself and how you are as a person. meeting someone for the first time is a way to show them who you are but that impression never changes because they know that you are that person of character. theres many ways of having a good, bad, and persuasive attitude when you meeting a person, businessman, and even a friend. i think that the first impression towards a person can be like how they view you as a whole. it doesnt always have to be about character this could go for anything even including: movies, video games, and television shows. they can have a strong impact on you, even little kids that are growing up that watch TV, those television show have a first time impression towards them.

Meeting a person with a bad attitude/ impression can show you that they are not good for you or even around the people that you hang out with, many people tend to have the impression of a cool and awesome person when in reality they arent that person, many people try to put up an image so people think that you are ""awesome"" or ""cool"". leaving someone with a bad impression can have a big or negative impact in their life for example when you first meet a person you wanna date they could leave you with a good impression but over time that person can change the way they feel about you and you see that a they are changing as person which many people arent comftarble with change of a person. also having a bad impression on the job you are trying to get, wont get you the job because of how you are behaving or using words or even body posture says a lot about a person.

Good impression that you show the first time to a person meets you be kind and just have a good attitude so people will have the same to you. being good to people in life can alway have a positive outcome. dont always be god to people that treat you bad and run you over and over again.

i think its best to havea good frist impression to anyone you meet in your life because those people will like you and some will not like you at all, but being the best of yourself to your potential can be amazing at times but always have a positive mind set about impressing other people and its not always about impressingother people its also about having that thought of being your best at all times.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0
A1B06DEEA15C,"I agree with the Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, that failure plays an important role for some people in life, If they fail once they could get it right the second time and succeed. People will learn from their mistakes and it will take time for people to be successful in their life and accepted that they failed for the first time.

Its very important for people to know that if they fail they can try again and can go back and check to see what was wrong or think to them self what they did wrong, They can learn from their mistakes and not give up when they fail the first time.

People that have failed in life know that its not a bad thing when they fail. Its actually a good thing to fail in life and people that know what its like to fail would get inspired to work extra hard and take more time to look over everything. They would also stay on the positive side and have family, friends, and other people supporting them and cheering for them no matter what happens if they fail or don't fail.

The British prime minister probably has fail in the past years when he was younger and was successful after he learned from his mistakes. Nobody is perfect in life thats why we fail in life to see what we did wrong and make sure that it doesn't happened in the future.

Here is one example, If someone wants to open a coffee shop the person would need to get a loan from the bank so they can purchase a building and to start their own coffee shop business and come up with the name's for the coffee shop, drinks, pastries, and food that will be on the menu. People that have wanted to start their own coffee shop business or other kinds of business, doesn't always work out for them for some reasons and are not very successful when doing the planing their ideas and would want to hire someone to help them come up with more ideas. The person might not be happy when he or she were unsuccessful for the first time to try and open their own business and take a few more months to come up with more ideas to be more successful for the second time.

Overall, I think that failing is good thing and not a bad thing its just people dont have to give up after they fail the first time they need to give another second chances until they get it right. People should get inspire to keep working hard when they fail and not quit, because not everyone in the world is perfect in life. ",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5
A1CA2A691C98,"Do I agree or disagree on Ralph Waldo statement well I agree on what he is trying to say because you can master beyond something and get somewhere in life.

Also following your dreams and do what you want to do. Try not to follow anyone's decisions they make for you because it's not right for them to do so. It's your path to choose what you have set in life. You can master things in life if you believe in yourself and never give up. But people can tell you that you aren't too good for things and you should give up on everything.

If you were to master something important you will get somewhere in life. It can start by graduating from any school. If you mastered graduating from school it can get you a new job where you can do something better and you can grow from it. Also you can be willing of having a family , that for me it's a huge thing to have because they will help you get better opportunities. However mastering what you can it can take you to places and you can improve to becoming something better. Trying your hardest is a big key note because if you don't you may never get to become what you want and you may never grow from it.

What do I want to do and should I follow my dreams or goals. By following what you want to do you can become the next big singer out there. If you want to achieve something no one believed you can do you can become the next president. Also by thinking out of the box it can make you do things you have always wanted to do. However if you believe in yourself you can be a professional soccer player without being so ostentatious. But people can bring you down and you can always bring yourself back up if you believe that you can do it.

How can I not try to follow anybodies decisions they make for me. Well you always have to make sure that things are about you even if you don't want it to be about you. People can make you do things so you can give up on something you set you goal on. Don't listen to what they say or on what they want to tell you. It's not good for you to have negativity around you. Also you have to efface on what people have to say about what you do or how you are going to do it . However make your mark and show them what you can achieve and make the people who believed in you proud that you did it.

When someone has something so positive to say that can change someones thinking I have to agree to what he or she has to say and it's true we do have to master beyond something or we will never grow. To never give up on following your dreams and what you have set your goals for . Also try not to listen or follow what anyone decides for you and try to make it about what you want it to be .

A problem dose not mean your a life is over or i can not go back to redo it again, yes you can it your life you choose how to solve your problems. An example, having an F in your test dose not mean it the end no it not it the beginning because that how you start by giving your self a failure path and make it a success and that how a problem start. A way to solve a problem is like in school, at home, in the street, is talking it out with someone who can help in school you can talk to you teacher your consular, at home you can talk to you mom, sister, dad, brother, in the street if it a fight talk to each other, cause a street is not a place to fight. When having a problem you will know because it will give you this negative feelings like you are not perfect you can do anything right, you should know that failure is a lead to problem, a problem is a lead to second chance, second chance is a way to be success, just so you know giving yourself a second chance and accepting second chance when someone offer it that like the best thing in life cause keeping the positive spirit is what and giving yourself a chance is what other want so use it like you use your phone.

A28940CA5863,"Do you think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? Personally, I would rather go to my house, and eat spaghetti because people need to realize of what career they would want to choose if they would want to succeed in the future. Few of my friends want to become a doctor, and some of my other friends would want to become a mechanic. Careers are like longtime thinking, for people would want to change their minds, and choose another career that is more suitable for them to learn in college. The reason why I choose this topic, for people need time, impression, and support for their careers.

People always need time to think of what career that they would want to choose, so they can enjoy their careers, and have better reputation in their work. Some teachers think it is a better idea to think of a career in high school, yet some students disagree with the teachers. Students in high school need to understand that if they don't like the career that they choose, they are more likely to fail than succeeding than others in their careers. Bunch of students agree that having to think about career in high school is a good thing; however, a lot of students disagree that we should have more time to think about careers at a older age. These are the reasons why I think young people should have more time to think of what career that they would want to have, so they can gain more confidence in the future.

Impression is also important, for it helps people gain morale if they would want to think of a career. Some students think having impression won't help you, yet some students do agree that having impression would help pressure them to find a career. Generic_Name went to college with impression, so she had the confidence of choosing what career that she would like to choose at a older age. Impression isn't for everybody, nor it is for some students who need of help finding a career in high school or college. Impression would help some students in high school, but some teachers do think it would also help them in college. Personally, I would need impression if I would wanna go to college.

Support is also good too, for people who aren't confident of choosing what career they want to learn about, so they would ask their friends, or even family members for help and support. Support is a main key to success; however, few of my friends disagree with me. The reason why they don't believe in support, for they found careers easier without receiving help in college, or even in high school. People also need to support young kids that having a career is a longtime changing, so they would have to think about it in college, and not in high school. Generic_Name wanted to become a doctor, yet she didn't do well, so she gotten support to look for another career in college. The reason why I like support, for I wouldn't want to brainstorm careers by myself.

The thing about young people is that thinking about careers in high school should have more time to think, for it is always important of what career they would want to choose. I do agree that some students should brainstorm about their careers in high school; however, I am not very sure if they would like to learn a lot about whatever career they have committed to. Even people do want to commit to a career at a young age they would still need to know what to do to learn in college. Thinking about a career isn't easy, yet some students don't take it seriously of what career that they are committed to. These are all the reasons why I think we should have time, impression, and support. We should commit to a career at a older age, not at a younger age.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5
A2C232F3D92C,"Are you happy with your self? Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" Do you agree or disagree with this statement? I agree with this statement, being yourself and not letting people change you is a great accomplishment. One should never allow someone to change you.

To be yourself is the best way to the greatest accomplishment because people try to persuade you or talk to you about doing something else that doesn't impressed you. You have to actually think about what you actually want to do to accomplish in life. You don't have to listen to what other people say and tell you. Most of the time people gives wrong advice to others. You have to believe in yourself, that you can accomplish greater thing just doing what you admire.

Go with what you think its a good decision for you, either being by yourself or need someone to tell you what to do. Most of time people doubt others. Having a strong feeling that being by yourself is a good decision for you, that a good thing because thats means you have no problems of being by yourself. If you know that you going to succeed in life then that amazing because you believe in yourself . Go with that decision that you think is right and don't allow nobody to make you do something that you don't think is wrong.

However, there are people who think allowing someone to change you can be an accomplishment. Only if it is for the good. For example, if someone is having a hard time being a good citizen and they are always getting into trouble, then yes changing them is a good thing. You can help them out by saying "" what you doing is not a great decision, you should have better choices then getting into trouble."" Another example, is if someone is having a difficult time, you could help them by giving them good advice how to accomplish something.

Being yourself lead to great accomplishment. I agree with this statement. Sometime people try to change you because they thought you couldn't succeed with what you wanted to become or wanted to accomplish. Sometimes being yourself doesn't goes as plan as you thought it going to go. In my decision being yourself and actually knowing what to do is the best decision to the greatest accomplishment.

First getting more than one advice from someone help's them make a better decision because they know what advice they need and what they don't need. Second receiving advice from more than one can make you combine all of the advice's together to make one big advice.

While getting advice from one person is great, Receiving advice from more than one person is beneficial. Getting advice from more than one person is more profitable than getting it from only one person. Getting advice from more than one person can help you really think about the advice's people gave and you can benefit from the one's you understand. When you get the advice's from those people they want you keep it so you can use it in future. You can get advice from anyone but you have to understand the advice that will benefit you.

When you receive multiple advice's you can combine all their advice's to get one big advice that summarizes all the advice's you were given. When you get advice from someone it connects to things such as, School, Sports, Jobs,and many more. When you get advice it's to motivate your self to do more. When you get advice from more than one person it's usually something your good at. When those people talk about the same advice you have heard before it all connects together to make a big advice. The big advice you get from all the people that gave you advice's is to either improve or be successful.

I think getting advice from multiple people can help you make a great decision. First getting more than one advice can help know what advice is useful and what advice is not useful.

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for the students to attend classes from home by way of online, or video conferencing. Student would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online because is not teacher help, and cheater.

To begin with, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online because is no teacher help. For example, Generic_Name is doing his work online and there is something that he not understand, he will need the teacher help,or the teacher explication on how to do it, all students need some times help for the teacher. In conclusion, students have to attend classes from school because the teachers can bring their helps for anything you not understand.

Secondly, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online because they can cheat on. For example, Generic_Name is working on geometry and she don't know how to do parallels, the only way that she can work on it, is cheating, she can take out her phone and search the answer from the internet. In conclusion, students would not benefit to attend classes from home because they can cheat on it and not learn how to do their works by their self without internet.

Some people argue, the students need some extra help. This is true because students with 18 years old they want to left the school for help their family even if they don't want to left the school they have for work and get some money. students would benefit from being attend classes from home by way of online because they want to finish the school. however, the students need to work hard for help their family and finish the schools for a job more better and get more money.

Your principal has decided that all students must participate in a least one extracurricular activity. For example, students could participate in sports,work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council.

Would Students want to be forced into taking a program, club, or after school activity, no, of course not. Nobody wants to be forced into doing anything in life. Besides if a student was forced to participate in an program what activity's would they have. what if he/she doesn't like sports or working on the year book or etc. How does it benefit the student in any way.

Students should have a right to decide whether or not they want to join a club or activity. The reasoning for this is because, if a student does not like any of the programs then it wouldn't be fair if he/she still had to choose one. Thats why its wrong for the principal to make this decision. Imagine a boy who just moved in from a different state. The boy had a lot of amazing, awesome friends that he had to leave behind. Now he has to transferred to the nearest school, having to start anew. His parents gave him the election forms and he has signed up for everything he needs. Only later to realize that it is a requirement to sign up for a ""extracurricular activity."" Although the boy does not want to sign up for an activity because he does not know anyone. Now put yourself in that students shoes how would you feel in his situation.

Most Students just want to get through the day, get home and relax. However, by adding this system the principal is adding a whole other level of stress for these students. I mean who would want to be forced into working on the yearbook or playing soccer yea absolutely no one. Students want to be free. Except with a required activity they have a whole other class to worry about and making sure that class has good grades especially if that student dislikes being there.

It needs to be a choice whether or not a student wants to select a ""extracurricular activity"".

I can see a probable reason the principal made this choice. I assume it is because the principal does not want there to be empty clubs/programs and that makes sense but it isn't fair to the students who do not want to be apart of any activities. Now it would make sense if the principal had a democrative system where the school voted for this option but thats not the case in however that is what the principal should do and the principal should ask the school to vote to get rid of the requirement or keep this way this can give the students, the principal and staff more reassurance. If the principal did do this then a huge weight is lifted off their shoulders.

Jumping to my next conclusion if a extra activity is required then this can cause stress and anxiety for students who dont want to be there. This can cause of lack of thinking process, failure in grades and bad attitude.

Let me explain. myself for example. If I was in a extra elective and I was forced to be in and i didn't like it I would start to stress then my grades in that class would start to fail, then slowly my grades in other classes would also fail. Now my parents would start to be disappointed in me and i would start building up anxiety. That anxiety if built up enough would most likely lead to depression and worse case scenario suicidal thoughts.

So in conclusion it is a bad idea to require a extracurricular activity.

Instead of forcing it i would heavily recommend choosing a activity because you never know how someone feels about certain things.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5

To get the job you like makes it more interesting .I would like to be selected to get the job that I am interested in because I want to get the experience and improve my skills to become an experts of it.

Dear Mr. Manager, I heard that you are selecting students to give them the opportunity to work in your company to gain experience, and to see if that job interests them. I want to be one of them, and to see if I am able to do the job the way it should be done. This opportunity can give me the chance to get more experience and to see if the job is interesting for me. I can make sure that if I get the job I will learn more about it. For example, Generic_Name, a smart student in my biology class was always wanted to work in a science department and to be a biology teacher in future. Last year she got the chance to work with Generic_City Biology and Science department. After a while she gives up and didn't continue to her job anymore. The reason that she left the job was that she didn't find it easy and interesting. This chance helped her a lot to select a better option and choose something new. She is happy about it, because she got experience and that was a golden chance for her to see if she is good at science subjects and that changed her mind not to become a biology teacher. Furthermore, I can add that getting the job that you like gives you more positive energy towards it and makes you work hard for it to achieve your goal.

We can't improve our skills until we don't try something new. Improvements always comes from doing something if we set goals to improve our skills definitely we will achieve it. Every job and activity we do we must have some good skills in it, or if we don't we can work on it to improve it. For example, my brother loved to work with

IT companies, he is good in repairing laptops and mobiles. He was studying Cisco and switch repairing at Sterling IT institute. He was doing good in his class, but for improving his skills and to see if he had learned something he needed to get a job. He started making labs at home with his classmates and was looking for a job. After he was approved by one of Cisco companies, he started improving his career and working hard to learn more everyday. After a year, beside that he is studying,he is now serving as a substitute in his institute. It's all because he has more experience and worked on his skills. Furthermore, I can say that having skill and talent can give us more motivation and helps us improve more everyday.

In conclusion, I can say that getting involve in such programs and company jobs helps students to choose their career and gives them the opportunity to see if they really want that job or are they ready for the career that they are dreaming for.

The first reason, I say that because the students will be more excite to came to the school, they will say, I like to go to shool beacuse, I practice somenthing that I love. I think that the schools need to change to give the student to choose, what they want know, I not talking about the classes, I talking about careers guides.

If the school's have guide careers or activities of work the students, they will enjoy that.

The seconds reasons is personal but, I see that almost the all people of my country when they come here and they have the opportunity to study but, when they end from the high school they stay in the same thing working in not good jobs earning 14 dollars per hours and some people say now that the diploma from high school is nothing to their. Some people go to school beacuse it's something ilegal, if they not going, I think they will put more interest to the study if they have the opportunity to study what they want to be when they are more olders. This are examples from others people too.

The students dreams that the school have something similar from college.

Some people tell me that when I end from high school, I will work in the same jobs, maybe I think the same because my family don't have the money but if the school's have something of academic's to know about the jobs, maybe the academic is not free but, is more cheeper than college or the school's have something that we can know about the jobs.

Little things like that i would consider to interact with another. There's many other things that would be important to interact with, especaily if it has to do with yourself. Technology itself is good hepler now in days. It can help you with anything that you are in need of, thats why i say it's more of a negative and positive for obvious reasons.

Technology does not effect people, or the way they are getting taught. Teachnology is something good for us, helps us keep things more in order, or can hold more information insted of having paper copys all over the place. technology can be a other way of interacting with other people for example like making a phone call, or a text, or even a video call those are other ways of making contact with one another. thats why for those reasons technology isn't making an effect on us as much.

Technology, so this where it could effect us. Well one it could effect if the perosn doesn't know how to multitask. Two if can effect you for example with your learning. Three it's going to be hard for you to listen and to keep up with who you would be talking to. lets just say you apply for job and your stuck on phone texting others about other job opportunity and your interveiwer send out your job interveiw date and because you were stuck on your phone you miss your job interview. that would suck. for those reasons technology would effect.

Technology itself is good and bad because there's many good things that you can do, but there's other things that you could miss. yes they both work good making or not making interactions with or without technology, but i rather have more human contact just because i rather not miss anything.

A83B38711F26,"Conserving energy and resources should not mean that children should go to school for only four day and 2 hours. Children are not going to be able to process what there laurning. Some children cant benefit from this. There are tomay people that need more help then others. People need the benefit of more school day. School is inportent to many people. We need them school day.

Conserving energy is a good thing for people but children need time for school, with not that much time for school we are going to have a lot of people failing or droping out. Children like school because out side of school, they dont have nothing and school is the way out of having nothing but they make the best of it. Them people that dont have notheing make something out thim safes from school like sports. People that play sports need school too. How are they going to play if there grads are bad or they need to stay after school to practs. They need it more because there trying to reach to the NFL and not that much people can do it. Poeple are just trying to make it throw or other people that just dont care.

Two hours, you are not going to laurn nothing, time is most inportant to many people. People will need more then 2 hours. Teachers most inportint need more time to work. Theres not even going to get payed will they need more time. How are they going to pay there bills. People need to under stand that people have inpront thing to pay. People need to thank about other people not just them selfs.

A84FFDD09442,"The positive attitude is the key to success in the life, because a person with good attitude good energy always is accepted, a person with positive attitude always is happy, because they believe thta everything is possible, that people with good energy they trasmite good energy to everyone around they, the positive attitude os the key to success in here reasons why: More effective in the job,

better relationship with family and friends and good life in general.

Positive attitude is more effective in the job, because we have to believe in our self for example; Generic_Name is working in a company they have a big project and everybody say This is too much we cant do this all this is wrong but Generic_Name say all is possible in a teamwork, is very effective if all the pieces are good nothing cant be wrong Generic_Name always have good attitude and is that why the boss always say go and ask for help to Generic_Name.

A person with positive attitude is a support, for example: Generic_Name have a big problem, but Generic_Name have a friend and her friend is her support, because with somebody is in problems need friends with good energy positive attitude. People with positive attitude always have good friends, because they listen that problems and them say All is going to be fine just wait for the right time.

My mom always say Believe in God and be positive.

After the rain the calm come. All the people say In the life all have to be positive because if i have to do something and i do my best with my best attitude, im going to be fine with the result, because i give everything. For example: Generic_Name want to be part of the marine she love the Marine, but her parents said is too much difficult is impossible for youa but Generic_Name have positive attitude.

The positive attitude always is going to be the key to success in life, because it is the base of everything all the peoples have to believed, is dosent matter what other people say or do, because in the future the only responsible for the things is going to be you nobody also. In the life that people have to show the better face and smile and say everything is possible,but no only said, that people have to believe that. All the people have to put a positive attitude and their job, school, home and in the general life and are going to be the things change.

sometimes in the life that people need a push and a person with positive attitude can be that push.

If a person dont have positive attitude that person always is going to do everything wrong, because if a person dont believe in herself nobody can do it.",3.0,2.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0
A8D0ADC676C0,"Everyone would eventually ask an advice if they need help on a particular subject or ask for an opinion if they ever get confuse. Advises or opinions would solve one's problem. For example, to prevent making poor choices or decisions, to determine which advice is accurate, and to allow someone to feel secure with choices. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

First, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by preventing making poor choices or decisions. For instant, if someone attempts to steal. If there's something you want but it's expensive. Also, if someone gets in a fight. If there's someone you don't like or disagree with. Lastly, if someone lies. When someone did something wrong and lied about it. Seeking multiple opinions can help some make a better choice.

Furthermore, seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice by determining which advice is accurate. For example, to be sure that it's reliable. If many said the same thing while others said a different thing. Also,if someone wasn't sure about the advice. Ask people for more advice if the advice is inaccurate. Lastly, if the advice is inaccurate. If someone said one thing while others said the other thing. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

Finally, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by allowing someone to feel secure with choices. For instant, if someone gets confuse. If you're lost on one subject. Also, if someone gets lonely. if someone doesn't have a baseball team. Lastly, if someone gets worried or afraid. If someone you know is absent or gone. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

In summary, viewing many opinions can benefit people to make a better choice by preventing making poor choices or decisions, determining which advice is accurate, and by allowing someone to feel secure with choices. I believe that asking yourself for advice is also necessary. but, viewing many opinions from people is probably more necessary than viewing your own advice.",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0
A91E59572DA0,"Technology had been a useful tool for the man to make his life easier. Cellphones, smart watches, and more make information very accesible and easy to find. But technology also has a negative impact on social relations, as it reduces human contact and promotes lazyness. The main target is the youth, which is more exposed to technologycal advanced nowadays.

When we think about technology, social media comes related too. For some, especially teenagers, these websites work as entertaining platforms, useful to share memories and talk with friends and new people. While these can make contact easier, the risks become higher when social media is not used properly. Posting personal information, such as your adress, cellphone, or location, is an irresponsible action which could lead to unsafe situations. Websites like Facebook and Instagram make identity theft easier: as they reduce human contact, people can take advantage of the users by introducing themselves first as a 'new friend,' to then execute their real intentions. For instance, kidnap and monetary robbery are the most popular cases that come out of social media.

In addition, social wesites and items like phones can be utilized in the way. There have been lately a lot of users claiming that their phones are listening at all moment, a tactic which could be useful to spy on people. As this theory has not been confirmed yet, it could be easily enforced by anyone with the required knowledge.

Productivity is another factor influenced by technology. The main purpose of most technological items is to make our lives easier and, in some cases like hardwork larbor, it can be very efficient. But when people start spending hours with these objects, the development of dependency towards technology could increase. Video games, for instance, have become the addiction of many kids, who stop performing their typical responsibilities in order to play with these. This is another way human contact is reduced, which will have a significant impact in their future lives. To develop social skills at a young age is very important for kids to succeed in the future. It's true that many factors affect the achievement of succeess and it can not be predicted by the skills a person has; but what it's true is that we are always going to be exposed to social interactions and it's neccessary to learn how to manage them.

A solution for this problem could be in the parents' hands. Enforcing limitations on the use of technology not only will create a stronger relationship between them and the children but it will be beneficial for the kid's future.

After all, technology has become a advantage for many of us in our daily life. However, it's important to stay aware about its risks and exercise a responsible behavior when using it. Moreover, we shouldn't let it take total control of our actions and enjoy in-person relations more. ",5.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,4.5,4.5

And i sent friend requests to my friends from school, when i playing with them i was the only one who just started.

I would just keep dying because i didn't know how to play, so what we would do we would hide the whole game and wait to the vary end to try to win. Then as time went by they added creative and creative was your own world you can join and do whatever you want, you could buildfight your friends or make teams or even do free for all.

And as time went by again i was getting better and told myself i want be really good at the game, so and i looked in youtube and it gave me so much information. I learned so much new things that i would practice in creative to try to learn them.

I would mostly look in youtube on how to do retakes, retakes are ways to try to get above a person without getting shot at. It would be really helpful but then my skill as a player was not getting better, because the only thing i would practice is build the right stuff. I would not be good ar editing or aiming, because i would never practice it. It took time to stay above the meta i just needed to find the right balance for all 3 major componets in the game.

Then people discovers new things like how to win fights and how to make smart moves and smart edits that can win you the game. what im just lacking as a player is making the smart dicisions, like when to rush a player and when to not but in my opinion there is always something to learn overall fortnite is one of my skills that took me time to learn.",3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

AB2FD69DBACF,"""Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose think about the effects of allowing students, to have and use cell phones in the classroom. Students think that cell phone use will make easy to study and to get high grades, every teacher, students and parent are debating if they should let students use the phone during class.

Cell phones can be used for good reasons like study look for information, thats right that make school easier but at the same time is a distraction for students, because cell phones not only can be use to study, they can be use to communique play video games and thats a distraction for every student. That makes everything go back works instead of going forward.

also cell phones make easier for teacher to grade, now you can scan papers with phones and you can make grades for every student, but still is a distraction, am saying this because I am a student and the same happens to me, i know what it is and i think we should not use cell phones during class not even to do homework or anything relacionated with school.

To not have those types of problems we should let have every student have a computer, computer are more useful to search for problems, articles, to write etc. This will make more easier school than having phones during class, school should work more on this and all this is for a better if for good of our country to have better jobs better doctors, nurses etc.

I disagree on this article because cell phones are a distraction for students, i think thats why computers were made to use, to work, study, applications, papers, images and more, school should make this up and let students use a computer in class better than phone use, like i said do it for a better life, for more knowledge, to be safe and prepared for any circumstances that can show up to life.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5

Limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had negative effects on people lives here is why without technology we are nothing because we depend on the technology everyday,every second of our life.

Technology has negative effect on our life here is why .In school the teacher goes over present ion online and it does not teach the student how to do there assignment . Because of the technology there is no teacher and student connection. In my country when i was young we did not had any technology my teacher would go over the assignment and he would explain the assignment on the board and if you did not get it .He would explained it to you again thats what school should be about making a connection with the teachers. I remember when i was young me and my friends would hangout in the cafeteria we would talk about our day. But now because of the technology during lunch time all my friend just uses there phone and we dont even talk to each other. Because Limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had negative effects on on peoples life.

Because of the technology we have war between country with nuclear weapon. Because of technology people do not go outside of there house. They stay home and watches movies,read book and play games cause they have the technology to do that. they don't care what happen outside even if some is dying outsides of there house the would not care because of technology makes human emotion less and makes us weaker. We depend on technology way to much. when i was young if need a book i would go to the library and get the book rather than being lazy and sit on the couch and order it online technology makes us lazy. I remember we would go to eat food out and enjoy each other company talk to each other. Nowadays people just order food online and eat inside and use there phone rather than talking to each other. There is no more human connection.

In work technology is helpful but you are always get distracted because of the technology. Human being are easy to manipulate if there is game going on and there favorite team is playing. They will forget about the work. pull there phone out and watch the game. Because of that they get fried from work than they have to find a new job and figure out how to get food. If you did not had technology we would not had that problem. The technology is making people losses there job. Sometime technology can be hurtful then being useful.

Because of technology there is more accident than there were when there was no technology. Because people when they drive they text each other and they miss a turn and get hit by a car accident happen. Because of your mistake there is another person dead and you are blame for it. cause of you somebody loose a husband,wife ,child in the accident.

AB9FC91ABAD7,"People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincs and ideas. Many people today and day has the problem about how to take decisions is so hardnees to take your own decisions, because some people think a lot of what decisions to take that's the principal moment that we need help from someone isnt's matter if your dad, mom or an expert . Sometimes in life you have to take your own decisions because you can fell or not but you're going to learn what's good or bad, taking your owns decisions it teach you many things about how to take your own decisions with responsabilitie . I take my own decisions because that can help me to grow as a person but yes sometimes we need somebody also opinion .

However , not everyone thinks like that because they like to ask for and opinion to an expert because, they think that can make you to take the decions easily and that's right but isn't enought for some people because probably they have done before and it doesn't feel enought for them , because that's the opinion that you're receiving probably you can be agree or not, but you still are thinking in what decision shoult they take decisions are not something easy nothing is easy in this life that's one obstacle in life basicaly is one step that can help you to grow as person because you can learn from bad decision that you have taked in the past.

Nevertheless ,

everyone can go to see and expert he or she can give you many types of ideas about what decision you shoul take but when you depends on someone you will never going to learn how to take decisions by your self, how I

say before that is one step the can help you to grow as person, you're growing base on what life is giving you is not matters if is good or bad but that's how you know what's better for you and it help you to grow as a person, makes your life succefully.

Moreover , you don't have to take decisions by your self everything is depending on the problem it can not be a problem especificaly but in case is very important to count with other person opinion it can make your decision more easy ,like my grandfather tell me every time when I talk to him '' be sure of what are you doing'' and what I reffer with that is the you must be right of what are you doing is so important you always count with friends or someone speciall in your life those people can make your life better and far away of the problems .

Overall , people have to take their own decisions using the best way for each of them , Because decisions are not easy to take you must take it without precupation because when we worry about that and we say or we do the first thing that it comes to our brain isn't one hundred percent right sometimes it can be good or not but that's how we learn of our mistakes , that's how life work , it give you a hit when you must think nothing is going to happend, that's why is important to count with friends or your mom and dad but when you're going to ask an opinion of what decision shoul you take you must ask an adult , they are the only ones that they can give you the best ideas of what is better for you and your future and that's how you learn and the most important to grow as a person .

ABC59FCA6150,"In some schools think that attend classes at home is most better ;The fifty percent of the schools think that attend classes at home is not productivity. Some people might say that taking classes at home can't benefit students because when their need help or have some question any teachers can be there ,taking classes at home can benefit students because their can have more time to sleep and their don't need to take a bus or walk.

In the first place ,attend classes at home can't benefit students because when their need help or have some question any teachers can be there. For example , I have a cousin who take classes at home but he never know anything because no body can help him when he have a question. While, always I tell him that if he have a problem I can help him or another option is that he don't taking classes at home anymore. Also he don't make friends because he do not go to the schools. I choose this option because a lot of student waste their time taking classes at home. I am agree that attend classes at home not have benefit.

likewise, attend classes at home can benefit students because their can sleep more. In my case, if a have the opportunity to take classes at home i'm happy because I love sleep a lot. For example,the twenty-five of the student get classes at home because don't like to make a friends or their believe that their can do the work along. The classes start early so in this way they do not have to wake up early. Also, if people sleep more their can be more healthy this is the reason because student like to take classes at home to be more healthy. I choose this option because is important remember that many students want to sleep more or get extra time because their have a job and is hard to them do two thing at the same time .For this reason many student choose take classes at home.

In addition,attend classes at home can benefit because student don't need to take bus or walk. For example,some student do not have to take bus because are more near to the school. In my case, I have to walk from my home to my schools sixteenth minutes every single day. when winter come and is so cold outside it's not good to walk in this temperature. while , this is the reason because students take classes at home although sometime can't benefit. Another reasons is that some students have to take the public buses so is take classes at home don't have to take bus. I choose this reason because many people forget that many time is not easy for the students do that.

Finally,everything have advantage and disadvantage because some schools think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home and some schools are disagree. Also some students work a lot so their can benefit with this opportunity. Although, attend classes at home is not the same thing like go to schools and receive help from teachers, students, etc. In addition, if some schools offer this opportunity have to think about it and look the best option.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
ACE1BE41A8E0,"One of the most famous quote by Thomas Jefferson is, "" Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" He believes that there is so much that can be done if we are always doing something because if you are doing something all the time even if it's little it can be done but may take time. I believe we accomplish more if we are always doing something for example if you don't practice everyday then you won't get better at soccer. There is a lot of things that need be done in our country. One of the most important thing is racism , if we do something about that everyday to end racism.

If you are always doing something then you will get a lot done. When your building a house you are always doing something to it but if you stop then it will more time to build. I always believed that i can do a lot if i'm doing something all the time. When i was little i use to make Lego's i would always build them, i was always doing something to them. My mom always told if i'm building them everyday i could get done fast. I prepare for school the same way when i have big projects. When i have big projects i tend to freak out. My mom tells to just break it down and do little bit of everyday. When i do that i get my projects done fast.

If you don't practice everyday then yo won't get better at soccer. If you want to be professional soccer you will have to work everyday. When you don't do that you won't get any better because you have to train everyday so you can be great at soccer. I use to play soccer 2 years ago and i wasn't practicing everyday so i did't get any better. My dream was to be a soccer player but i wasn't training everyday so i didn't get where i wanted too. Everyone has dream to be something in order be that you have to do something everyday to reach your dream. Most people don't make their dreams because they don't do the little things that matter everyday.

There is a lot that need to done in our country. One of the most important thing is racism. I believe we can end racism by doing something about it everyday. One of the most important things in this country is racism because a lot people are getting killed by it. Police officer shooting black men that didn't do anything. That causes people that have been killed family's pain. I think racism needs to end as soon as possible. A lot white police men are shooting black men and are not getting anything for it. I think they should at least get some punishment because it's not fair to the people who died family's. I believe this could be fixed if we all come together and do something about it everyday.

As you have read we accomplish more when we are always doing something. Only when we do something you accomplish more. By doing something everyday you can accomplish your dreams and get your work done. The world would be in better place if we everyone did something to make the world more cleaner and safe.

But, do you know if the student knows what he/she needs to know?. In some cases students didn't remenber something from high school. Many students forget everything that they learned when is Summer or when they stop to go to the school, in a very short time. It depend from the knowledge of a students if he/she can take everything on his/her heat. May be more time led the students to know what they want to do after the High School, and have elective classes can help the students to be a good worker in the future because they are more creative.

Depend from the knowledge of the student if he/she can take everything on his/her heat because some students have the capacity to learn a lot without forgered and other not, possibly they have apathy in some classes or they are more interested in other things since in some school districts offer progams that can contein clases that students don't want to learn. But, it can be very helpfull for the students that want to graduate so fast from the high school becuse may be they want to work without a interuption from high school's things or the want to go the colledge without they had a lot of time in high school. Also, some students think that have the capacity to graduate from high school in a short time and other prefert to graduate with the normal years because some students want to have the advanced diploma that can give you goods oprtunities.

May be more time led the students to know what they want to do after high school because some students graduated so fast that they didn't thing correcly what they want to be or what to do after the high, someway you have do to something in your life that can help you to live ecconimicaly between the world. For example, you are graduate today but in a week or a month you are doing nothing because you don't know what you want to do but you need something with your life. Also, if you want to graduate so fast from high school you need a plan like; i'll work after high school because i need money, or i want to study more because i think i need to know more and i want in my future. For example: the people who work after high school is the people that knows whar they want without matter the time that they took in the high school and the people who still stiding is because they arenot ready to know what they want or they still studing for a carrer.

Have elective classes can help the students to be a good worker in the future because they are more creative, and elective clasess led the students to learnd new things that can help them in the future and in their usually life. For example: if they take an art class they will be more creative, if they take a music art they can have their own record. Also , elective class give more oportunities that a progam that conteins the usually class and borred. Finally, summer is a good time to take a break from high school and you have the oportunity to be in a class

Online if it's difficult for you to remenber something during that time.

In conclusion, some programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years are good for the students who knows what they want to do after the high schools like if they want to work or if they will still studing. Also take a little bit time to graduate is not to bad because you never will to know what new things can you learn in the elapse of the time you keep have the oportunity to think more in what to do in the future. Also, if you have the capacity to remenber things for a log time is not too bad the idea to graduate in three years. The only thing that a student need to know is nake a plan for the future with clear ideas and be sure in what he/she wants.",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0

First, Lot of people reading a book and watch TV show or video on the phone. When I was in Generic_City, I saw lot of people read a book with their phone or tablet, Also they are still watching a video almost every times when they are in the vehicle, but this is not a negative effects on peoples lives. This is positive effects on peoples lives, because they are still reading a book.

Second, many of student are not doing homework or not focus on their school, the main is they are not doing homework and play video game, Also they are using a phone or listen music while middle of the class. Or some people not studied and cheating on the test or quiz. but they will get a good grade, but they dont know what they learned.

Finally, Old people doesnt know about technology, so some bad people using a technology for old people, and they get money from old people. This thing still happening lot of country, like Korea. I saw my grandmother happened too. They took $1000 from my grandmother, and they got busted. This is really bad negative effects on peoples lives.

But if you take that away from them there going to have nothing and they wont be looking forward to going to school. And they may feel that they are not good in any thing but sports; and it motivates you to be better in school it teaches you how to cooperate with other student , how to be a good leader/captain, and many more.

Students shouldn't use their cell phones in classroom for educational purposes its going to be big problem with teachers and parents if they are using their phones in class and teachers are going to be conserder about how bad they are going in school their grades are affecting them. I disagree i dont think that they should be allowed to use their cell phones in classroom It distracts them from learning and paying attention in class if they use there phones in class they will not know or learn the important information that the teacher is teaching cause what the teacher teaches is about what you need for your education. One reason is that They dont do their work if they have their cell phones they might be saying that they are getting their work done but they are not doing their work their doing something else on their cell phones. For example instead of them doing their work in class they are really playing games, watching movies listening to music , talking to their friends on the phone texting them they spent all their days in school using their phones doing all these thing that they shouldn't be doing and that won't help them in their education. A second reason why students shouldn't use their cell phones in class is that they aren't learning anything in class they dont listening to what the teacher is teaching in class its not helping them learn new things and have knowledge for other things and won't be really for quiz or test. For example when a test is coming up they don't do well on because they haven't been listening in class; they were too besy using their phones playing games, watching movies or whatever they were doing on their cell phones so thats why they get bad grade on their test and have bad grades throughout the year then they can't do anything to get their grades up before the quarter ends. Some say that cell phones are useful for school to have them as a resoucre when they need to find information about things their trying to look for. But they are wrong students don't need to be using their cell phone in their classroom at all it just distracts them even more from what they should be doing because if they are going a project for a class they don't need their cell phones with them they can find the information that they need by using other resource to get what they need for their project. For example if they are trying to find how to cook or bake they can go to the libary and look for a books that are about cooking and baking or they can also ask their teachers for help they won't need their cell phones to find their research. When we know that if they have their cell phones with them they won't be doing their work they will be doing other things that aren't importante. Thereforce that is why students shouldn't be allow to use their cell phones in class or when they are at school so that they can paytention in their class and learning what the teacher teacheing them everyday in class and like that they dont get bad grades. So student dont need their cell phones at any point in school they shouldn't be allowed for educational purposes they dont need to have them to distract them from learning in school.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5

And yes the world is going to take you down, is going to face you with things that will make you do wrong things, or change your mind like trying to be another person. But you has to face it don't give the rights to people to take you down. People when they see all the things you get done, they start to hating you. But you don't has to listen to then you dont' has to change your mind just because they are talking. Some people want to decide for you, i mean like for example; when you want to study a career but your friends, parents, etc they told you to study something you don't like, you dont has to listen to them you can make your own choice if you are a grow man you are going to do what you like, thats why you has to always be yourself,

I didn't pretend to be a person that was not me and as the author Ralph Waldo Emerson said ""is accomplishment to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else""

Always be yourself don't change your mind, because life is hard nobody said life is going to be easy you has to work hard for your own things, to be someone in this life and don't listen to the world because the world don't want to see you grow or happy.

I could see the nice green grass moving side to side, smell the fresh air, and see the pretty nice tall green trees giving a nice long shadow to the ground. I can tell people were having a lot of fun by their smiles on their face, and by running up and down the field. I can see people are having fun it made me want to have fun too. I remember the first time I went to the Community Park, then I went to the State Park, and also I went to the National Park.

The first reason, is when I went to the the Community Park for the first time. I could see this big blue, and yellow playground. Also I could see people running up and down at the Community Park having so much of fun. There was also other people playing tag with other people at the park. Lastly, the Community Park had so many fun equipment to play. Like the swing, slides, wall climbers and the monkey bars. There were a lot of people there so we had to wait for our turn to use every equipment they had at the Community Park.

Second reason, is when I went to the State Park for the first time too. I could remember walking under the trees with a nice wind blow to my face in a nice shadow made by the trees. Also I kept walking and I saw a lot of animals that were not attacking people. Animals that I saw were Frogs, Turtle, Fish, Lobsters, Birds, Snakes, Deer, and Ducks all over the park. Lastly, I saw their was a big river where people were fishing. Then Other people were swimming in the river water because it was a very hot day outside at the park.

Last reason, is when I went to the National Park for the first time also. The park has a lot of fun things that we can go look at and visit animals at the park. The animals they can go and visit are Monkeys, Snakes, Giraffes, Turtles, Tigers, Pandas, Birds, Frogs, Crocodiles, Gorillas, Sea Lions, Donkeys, Horses, Lions, Lizards, Iguana, and Elephants.

B0D627CB7309,"The American jazz legend Duke Ellington said ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" I believe that the meaning that this quote was trying to convey is that when we are faced with a problem it does not matter how challenging that problem is we must use it as a chance try our best. Sometimes a lot of things can happen unexpectedly but we must believe in ourselves that a problem could be an opportunity to try our best, it might also prepare us for bigger problems in the future. Although sometimes we might experience difficulties while trying to solve that problem in our lives we just have to keep on giving it our best to overcome it.

When we are faced with a problem it does not matter how challenging the problem is we must use it as a chance to try our best. Completing a group project, homework, or writing an essay are one of the few examples that can represent how sometimes it doesn't matter how big the problem is we must try our best. Finishing a group project, homework might seem as though it would be something that could be completed without difficulty it does take a bit of an effort for some people. However these people keep on trying because they want a good grade or don't want to fail class. This might apply to people that are still in school but being responsible and completing all of this work might prepare them for their future careers.

Sometimes a lot of things can happen unexpectedly but we must believe in ourselves that a problem could be an opportunity to try our best, it might also prepare us for bigger problems in the future. For example athletes, athletes sometimes sustain injuries while playing and have to recover. These injuries are not easy to recover from as it could damage a part of their body that could possibly prevent them from playing for some time. To overcome these problem athletes train a lot and use it as an opportunity to train and rest more to be in a good condition before finally playing with the rest of their team. These shows how sometimes you have to take advantage of something an use it as something to try your best on.

Although sometimes we might experience difficulties while trying to solve that problem in our lives we just have to keep on giving it our best to overcome it. Occasionally we encounter difficulties while trying to find the solution to a problem in our lives an example of this could be having to give a speech in front of a large audience. Some people t don't like speaking in front of a large group of people this can be a problem in their lives. These people have to be able to control their nervousness, something that could be hard to control. These people try hard to overcome a problem that is stopping them from doing certain things.

All of this examples represent how sometimes we're faced with problems that can be difficult to let go off. I think that the meaning of the quote is something important as it can apply to certain situations that are rather difficult. This quote shows us how sometimes there a certain problems in our lives that can be very difficult but we should try hard and do our best. I believe that there a lot of problems that we can learn from because sometimes while trying to solve those problems we make mistakes and we can learn form those mistakes and move on. I agree with this quote ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" I think its describes how sometimes we need somethings to happen in life that will makes us want to try harder to achieve our goals.

Humans now at days think that life is all about planing the future, and they all just trying to avoid problems, trying to live only winning but to reach success there must be a long journey of lost battles, of big problems but you must stay put because it does not matter how many times you fall you most get up again, and again.

My Dad once told me ''Always try never give up''. Back in 2014 it was my first day on the soccer academy

I been playing soccer as a defender all my life but this time it was my first time training in such a good team I started training every day make some friends too. A few days later the first game came I was not on starting line up or on the bench I wasn't even call for the game I was upset but I though that it was because I was new in the team, or the coach didn't know me well. The next day during practice my coach call me out and told me if you wanted a spot on the team you need to work harder after that day I knew I needed to start training more, going to the gym more often, and I start eating more healthy a few days later during practice I started seeing results I was getting stronger, faster, and skillful a few weeks later I got called for the teams fourth game but I was not in starting eleven I was sitting on the bench the all game I was upset I though I was failure once more but I never gave up and the next day I was back practice, eating more healthy, going to they gym more often. Halfway during the season one of the the starting defenders left the team and I knew it was my chance I started and I play all the game and I didn't just prove my coach that capable more importantly I prove my self. Later during the season in one of the last games in one play I dislocated my arm and that meant that I was out for the rest of the season. After three long months of recovery after was heal I started once again training harder, eating healthy, going to the gym more often getting ready for the next season. beginning of 2015 that season I was chosen as team captain and I played all the games all that hard work was worthy at the end.

It dosen't matter how many times I failed I never lose my enthusiasm because in life we are going to have many failures and we will feel life given up but we most get up and keep going it doesn't matter how many times we lose a battle our main goal must be win the war because just like Churchill failed again, and again but at the end he won the war with his people I also failed in my team again, and again but I won my own war at the end.

What ever the situation is good or bad you still have to tell the truth because it is good for everyone and, yourselves. When your honest more people can trust you and, the more people that trust you the better of a person you are. However, when it comes to suicidal thoughts or someone isnt feeling good tell the truth to an adult even though your friend told you not to you did a great thing for your friend, you might have saved his life. You can always tell the truth because being honest is always helpful and, good because, you did a good thing. Being honest is needed everywhere because if everyone was a liar our country woudn't be good. Telling lies is not good for you it's a bad habbit for you and, once you lie a couple times you will countinue to lie over and, over. Whatever it's about lying is never the answer to solve problems it makes it worse. You loose trust, you don't get anything out of it, and you just seem like a bad person by lying. For example, say you stole something and it was your friends toy. You decided to take him when he left it there and, he asks you ""Have you seen my toy"", The best option is to give it back or tell him that you have it don't lie and take it. It doesn't matter how badly you want it it's not yours. The boy's mother bought him that and it wouldn't be nice to just take it from him.

B2AD2177A42C,"People can form their own character based on what they choose to make it. A person is given the responsibility of choosing whether to do the good or bad thing. For example, if a person hears that their friend is in a bad situation and then choosing to help them out, they are showing that they are capable of make their own character. Others may say that people do not get to choose their own character because it is beyond their control. However, people can determine their own character based on how they want it to be because they know what steps they have to take in order to achieve their goal, they know what is best for them, and they know what they want to become in the future.

Knowing what steps to take will help the person make the right choice in defining their character. People tend to ask to other if the choices that they are making is the right one, but instead of asking others what they think the person has to be confidence in themselves that they are making the right choice. For instance, if a student wants a good future they have to work hard and study in order to accomplish it, and not choose to go the wrong way. On the other hand people may say that having a second opinion is a good thing, but that is wrong because it may cause them to doubt themselves. This is why people should first plan their transaction then take action on it.

People have the free well to choose what they want to be and what is best for them. A person knows what their interest are, so they choose according to what they like to do the most. Furthermore, if a person finds a job that they really like and want to get it, they will work hard for it. Some may disagree with this because others may see that what they are choosing to do is not the best thing for them. This is why people need to think about their choices before doing anything.

People can choose their own character and what they want to become in the future. People could choose to became; artists, actors, singers, or doctors because they have dreamed of becoming one of these seen they were a child. For instance, they would have to focus and work hard in order to achieve their future selves. However, others may say that it is impossible to become what you dreamed to be in the future because they will face may opsticals in their lives. On the other hand, if a person really wanted to become that person they will work intensively for it.

A persons character can be constructed by how they choose make it because they know the course that they have to take in order to achieve their goal, they know what is best for themselves, and they know what they want to be in the future. For example, If a person wants something badly, they will work persistently for it. Another example is that, the person will prove to everyone that they are capable of achieving their dream, and that it is possible to get.

I really think that if we want to be success in life, we have to be positive on everything, a lot of famous people said that for example, Michael Jordan said: the key to the success is to be positive.

We have to be positive on everything that we do if we have a negative attitude everything is going to be negative, maybe we are going to fail but that is another key to the success, that means we are doing everything well, but if we fail, we have to keep trying and never give up, until we get what we want, Michael Jordan said: I fail a lot of times but, that is the reason why I am who I am.

There is going to be bad moments in the journey but that does not mean that we are done, we have to be positive and think positive, because for everything there is a solution.

But another key to the success is to be humble, when we get what we wanted we have to remeber from where we come, be positive is important, but be humble is the most important thing.

But the most important thing follow your dreams and never stop fighthing for them, until you get what you want.

B4B2CB4AA07F,"The School Board plans to add one and a half hours to school each day. Is that a good or bad idea?

I disagree with that because, many students have other activities after school. It could also affect the teachers by them staying after longer and kids would just have to take in a lot of new material including homework and its not healthy for them.

I feel like when they add extra school hours to the day it would mess the students schedule up, they could have sports after school or tutoring. They could really enjoy their activities and for them not to be able to do any of that anymore does not seem fair.""I have soccer practice every day after school and I love it and it would be a shame if i had to give it up because of more school.""The parents would also have to change their schedule because they could be at work and then have to leave to pick up their children, they would also not have as much time hanging out with friends or family because school would be their main focus when they could be outside being kids. However students enjoy seeing their friends at school and saying ""hello or hi"" we need more time to communicate as well so our friendships don't fade.

Teachers as well would have to work longer shifts, and they already stay after grading students papers while they also have to find out what the next lesson is going to be the next day. They take time out of their day to help the students who are falling behind in the subject and need a little more help to make sure they succeed in school and in their future. Teachers also have families just like every other person in the world, which means they should be able to go home at a good time and help their children out with their work or be able to cook dinner and take time out to care for their kids. Teachers need breaks as well they work very hard to maintain the material we need to understand. They leave the school late like 5-6 and when they leave they look exhausted just imagine them leaving at 7-8 including the fact that they sometimes would stay after helping students and that makes the student tired. We need to give teachers some credit and not push the limits for them as well.

Students stay at school for eight hours each day and if you extend it to nine and a half hours that does not seem like a good amount for students. If they get a lot of work on top of their homework that could stress them out, and because of that their grades could go down because of to much work. We only get three months from school and some shorts breaks and then we have nine months of school, and then you add another hour then what is the point of a break when you just make the school days longer. Kids love going outside and doing there hobbies they can't just sit in a chair all day that also just makes them more irritated. Students also have test's and quizzes including homework each week. If you add more hours kids are probably going to fall asleep and not pay attention which would lead to not participating, students would not have a good attitude either because they would be grumpy and upset that the school day is longer. Our brain can only take so much and they would over due it which is not good for our health. We sleep 9-12 hours a day and have another eight hours at school and then we come home and do more school work and study which leads us pretty much with two hours of they day for us to eat and get ready for bed, just so we can do it over again the next day.

As a student I feel like that would be to much. We are people not robots we need to live not be stuck in a building all day long.

B4CBDAF1161C,"Although some people say that classes such of art, music, and drama should be electives because you let students think on themselves, actually some say that students must be required to take drama, art, and music classes because regarding to this classes students can earn a lot of experience in this area and in a short future they will be contributing to the culture of the nation.

Often people comment about the classes that students are taking on school. They are agree that art, music, and drama should be electives because you let students think on themselves. As every person in this country we must let them take part of their own decisions. Let me remain you, when you were young there is a bunch of classes that you didn't like to take, you complaint a lot. It's the same with this classes. Students must decide what they want to do in order of their own benefit. Many students don't even care about those class and their grades look affected because schools required them to take those classes.

People suggest that students must be required to take drama, art, and music classes because regarding to this classes students can earn a lot of experience in this area. For instance we are in at school!. we are connected to other schools we can make events and build good relations between students in order to let them gain experience. as soccer, basketball, baseball, and football also we can create competitions to motivate them. the kingdom university during 3 years asked to 100000 people "" How do they feel about competitions""

and the 90% of people said, competitions motivate you, is not matter what kind of competitions the human nature always wants to win. In other to this some schools are more likely to invest money on those areas.

Culture is a good reason why students should be required to take art, music, and dramas classes. When we talk about culture we have to do mention that it does a huge contribution in the society. for example Tourism, some research showed that the 70% of people who travel to another countries just to know how their culture works. like in years before the music had been changing. The United States of America have long history in music like Jazz, Rock, Heavy Metal and so on. That's why music classes should be required for students to maintain the culture of music in our country. When we talk about art everyone has heard about the famous Leonardo da Vinci and his picture of the Mona Lisa. Outside there is good amount of artist who became famous because they impressed the world with fantastic pictures. drama, our world is a age where we use the social media for many reasons and social media need authors. Example Hollywood every year produce movies. All those authors have a really good home, cars, and many facilities to live. That's why students must be required to take drama classes because many of them can have the opportunity to enjoy a life like this.

Some say classes as art, music and drama should be electives for students because the own decision is important but classes such art, music and drama must be required because it give the students the opportunity to gain experience in those areas and contribute to the culture of our society and nation.

B54DBEF87F11,"One day Generic_Namehad to go somewhere important with his family, but the problem was that he also had school to attend to. So he decided to do a video chat with his class, so he didnt he didn't have to miss anything from school. Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Doing oline stuff and video conferencing is a great way for students to stay on task with their work. I think that students would take the benificial of being able to attend to school from home because they have responsibilities and also a future ahead of them.

First reason on why students should take the benificial of doing school from home is because they have responsibilities. What if you get sick and don't want to miss anything then you can just video chat with the class. Your familiy decide to take a trip somewhere on a school week what do you do. You take your school stuff with you and a laptop to talk with the class. You can't miss more than like 9 days of schoo if you do you automatically fail, and that's your biggest responsibility on not failing, so you can take the advantage of video chatting with your class. Those are the reasons why I say students should do a video confrence because they have responsibilities.

Second reason on why students should take the benificial of doing school from home is because they might want to have a future ahead of them. When you are in your senior year that's when ou got to step up your game. What if you miss the bus or don't have a ride and you can't get to school then you obviously just video chat with your classes. If you don't understand with your school work you can do learning stuff online so you don't feel behind. Doing online stuff as well help students who don't know what they are doing and feeling left behind. Those are the reasons why students should do video confrences and online stuff because they want to have a future ahead of them.

Lastly, some people don't want to take the benificial of having video confrences or oline stuff to do school stuff at home. The reason why they don't want to do that is because when they are home they just want to have free time not to do school work at home. Also when they are sick they don't do anything because they think that they don't have that much work to miss. Well you see when you are home not doing anything then what are you getting done obviously nothing because they think that when they go back to school they won't miss that much work. That's why you should either do online stuff or a video confrence with your classes so you don't miss anything or be left behind.

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. There are many reasons why students should take the benificial of doing stuff like that because they have responsibilities and also have a future ahead of them. ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0
B596C01C5E87,"Considering businesses have adopted a four-day week , is probably good for them. On the other hand, maybe students in school can handle that. This would come to no harm for our society. We could make this a habit if we wanted it to be, just have to take some action in this. More energy would increase if this would happen. It could change many things, specially recourses. This also can come with responsibilities

Well , were trying to help students out more if we change a full week, to a 4-day week. Their would be no harm. Although , it may effect some students. I feel that, more energy, will come more as students. Coming to school with more energy to a 4-day weekend, students would often get things done more. This would be no harm to us. A full week might just be little too much. If businesses changed the policy for a 4-day week, why not us schools change that. This would benefit us students to get things done. Some of us students have sports or work after school. This policy would benefit us to do better in school and out of school. If schools allowed this , students would benefit this as a gift. If we would be able to take a vote on this, I personally think our schedule would be changed for good. Although, this policy can come with some responsibilities. Maybe most of us students can also handle this policy.

By extending school day for 2 more hours isn't a bad thing. Maybe for this policy to change, would require more school hours in the day. Furthermore, some of us students wouldn't mind that. Regardless, this helps us get more energy for sleep hours by making it a 4-day week. energy is important in this topic. Although, this helps our environment with no harm. This wouldn't be a problem overall. For example, How much energy would be transferred into a 4-day school week than a full week, way more and their is nothing wrong with that.

By handling business, taking care of things, it's all about responsibilities at the end of the day. All were trying to do is help our community and our resources. Students would benefit this and would be a helpful to us. As us students would have to take action into this situation. End of the day, we just want this to help us for the real world and specially after high schools or college. This could all depends the energy we bring also.

B5AA232A7261,"Dear, Mrs. Generic_Name

My opinon is that i'm disagree with this policy of students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. I don't think isn't good idea for students to commit to a career at young age.

It has come to my attention that some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time enter high school. Their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career and my position on this issue is properly to not makes that they aren't allowed to indentify a career at a young age from selected to guide them toward a specific career because for all of those who has a career and is because their are worked hard to arrive from they are and they get to propose.

Currently they can't have a commit to a career at young age, because for that has to be prepared and work hard nobody can has a commit to a career at young age.

for that you need to finish high school and college and work for the career you want.

Thanks for considering my opinion let me know if you have any question we can contact any assistance.

B5AE26EEE247,"Do you think that having a positive attitude is the key towards success in life? In my opinion I do think it is key towards success, and the reasons why I think this is one finding a good career, second is meeting new people in a good way.

In life you need money to pay bills and in order to get money for your bills is to get career, a good one at least, and everyone knows that you need a resume, a good skill that your going to work for, and a good/positive attitude to help you get the job. you people may wonder ""why need to have a positive attitude to get your job?"" well you want to impress and increase your rate of the person that is considering to hire you or not, also if start talking in a boring way the person might not hire you.

The second reason is meeting people in a good way and never in a negative way. meeting people in positive ways is very great thing to do meaning that if you treat someone like garbage they'll treat you the some or even doing something terrible that will ruin your life, and nobody like that at all, so thats why you should treat people positive to avoid the things that I mention or you just like treating people positive because thats your nature.

I know how this world works and to survive the world of negativity is to be negative as well to survive this world, however that isn't the way to live and nobody likes to do negative things as well as they can't hold it for long time and end up taking away their own life, so staying positive is a great way to live in life.

The conclusion I am trying to give at out is that being positive is the a great way live instead of living in a way of negativity since being negative is way to tough to live out and positively gives you joy and give more paths to walk through and thats what I think a key to success means.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
B76C582FA08B,"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. But are students really doing educational purposes? Should students really use their phones in their classrooms? Are students actually getting education? This is what I think about cell phones used in classes.

Most students get distracted by using their cell phones especially in class. I feel like every school should at least have laptops to give out for their students. It's more easier and less distracted. Because a lot of websites are blocked. Everyone gets distracted I know but thousand of teen are obsess with their phones. And if you're a teacher and let your student do their

""work"" in their cell phone, just know they might not be doing their ""work"" in their cell phones.

Some students might care more about their education then the things that's going on in life. Maybe not everyone feels the same, thinks the same, are the same. They might be capable to use their cellphones without getting distracted. Most of us can handle the distracting than others.

Most teachers actually let their students use their phones and don't really pay attention to their students. It might be our responsibility to be on track. But i feel like the teachers should at least stop us from getting distracted. Most students do get mad at teachers when the teachers stop us from using our devices. But do students know it for our own good.

When my parents take my phone away. I feel more free, relax, I feel good to be honest. I do get a bit mad at first. But then I think why they took it and how many time I lost. I feel like i'm back in reality and just leaving my moment god gave me. Honestly cell phones had ruined many peoples life's. Even toddlers these day all they do is come back from school and play on their parents cell phones or their losing sleep to watch videos .

I honestly don't think cell phones are healthy at all not even in education. Teachers shouldn't let their students use their phones at all. Only if it's in an emergency. Than that's when they should let them use it. But a real emergency. That's what I think about teachers letting their students use their cell phones during classes. ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5

B821E1D68BE7,"our big break. Summer is a season with very hot weather schools take this whole season to give students a big break summer is almost 2 months of break .Although some educators feel that the summer break is too long and schools should be year round schools. Which mean schools have one month of summer and a longer winter break. Nevertheless I think schools should not be year round schools because summer have a very hard weather also students use this time to plan some trip with family and friends.

Summer has a very hard weather to even think go to schools. Some day the temperature goes to 96c or more this is to hot for students. This hot temperature will make students swearing a lot and have very hard head hurt during class time level of streets will increase make students get bad grades or be angry all this time. Students who work in hot areas will feel more difficult to do a simple thing than students who work in a warm area . Hot areas make you not focus in your work.

In summer students have 2 months to enjoy make some family trip or things like that .Some students and families take this time to make some big family vacation plan. students wait for this time of the year to do their vacations. Because summer is a perfect time to go to the beach with family and friends or go outside the country to visit other country as we do not have school in summer we do not miss any day of school . trip can take so much time and students think summer is a perfect time to do. In summer students have enough time do anything students want some students use this time to find a job during summer as students do not have school they are more focus making money,so summer is very important to us to have some time with our family or make money.

In conclusion summer is a hard time to go to school but a good time to make some trip or money so the government should not cut off our summer. this is our time this is our big break. this when students can relax for a very long period without any preoccupation about schools work summer just happen one time each year students have to enjoy students deserve it for all hard work than students did in the whole school year.

There a lot that we can talk about but i highly recommend start off with the events and problems that we are having today. These events are not only effecting us it's effecting the whole UNITED STATE OF AMERICAN. Government shutdown it not only effect us it's effecting everyone business ,stores,farms . Seeking help and guidance make a huge different .Not only one mind that is speaking but there should be more so we talk and decade bout the issue and we can give more ideas and information. we don't need to tell our child to be followers there are leaders by teaching them these skills make a big impact . Leaders always seek help too they start off small but over the time the income until one point you have all knowledge you need but still to this day we still ask question grab more information.

we can compare these skills and source to our family,jobs,lifestyles.

It's not only students that need it .Having self-reliance and seeking guidance by seeking more information make us better in our jobs,lifestyles. We are also leaning but at the same time we also teaching it to others these skills are not useful. We would all need them reliance can be compare to leaderships standing up with you think it right for you and your career we believe that our answer is right but we don't want to be wrong but by seeking guidance and other people ideas always asking questions give you other option to choose from. I highly recommend that we always want to be the right but sometimes seeking answers and ideas give you more to think bout not only you and others too. we don't have to go far the military ,world decision does it effect us? yes it does why i'm asking you it because things no one really care bout really we should these are problems that need to be solves.

Military is a job,life and a career in your hands. Those man and woman that are serving our country they had a hard call to make. Before doing all that they need those soldiers to be ready there mind and skills are the most important that were self -reliance comes in to play. They can wait commander give you the call but you have man and woman life on the line you have to make a decisions. That why drill soldiers get you ready at base boot camp for mind and skills to ready and thing of these issue would not happening .doing that time you always need to ask question grab information it important you give you more feedback on what you work with or what are to get these skills are so important not only for the military in our life too we have big decisions to make it can involve your kids or career these thing you need to keep a look out.

NO matter what age,race,sex,color you are is so important to seeking these things the are really useful in the future and now always think that these skills get far and one day you would teach you kids bout money and business and more but right we all need to see what is really going with our government make a change we do not what to have a stock market crash again so use your voice,skills and etc to helps others not only yourself this world need to voices and our government need to rise again where it was before our jobs and homes are so important and how we spend our money and time and seeking out questions and answers make a big different in our society and community

Our jobs we get by our boss and our boss get there money from the government. When our government shut down there would we lose a lot of money a lot of business owners we lose there business and homes these thing we have to look at not should i get the new 2019 car no what is important is that show other step by step always seek guidance and give new ideas never forget to ask question it doesn't hurt to ask people you would see thing different and clearly. never be fare of asking we here to Lean everyday. we are people and no one is perfect we would learn everyday until we get old never stop seeking answers and always share your ideas to everyone. i'm ending this today saying seek guidance never stop asking question thank you so much for your amazing time have a great day.",2.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0

Rock climbing is a very fun, dangerous, and healthy outdoor activity to do. Many people who do rock climbing are living the happiest and healthiest life they can. You can also do hunting. Hunting is also a fun outdoor activity you can do, but it requires risk to do. Hunting is done by a gun which many people cant use or dont have but hunting is a fun activity to do if you do have a gun and know how to use it.

you can also go to parks. Parks are really enjoyable, there is lots of fun stuff to do in a park. There are slides, swings and other fun stuff. There are also animals some times in a park. its like a park and zoo mixed together. people can really enjoy there self in parks. Parks are not only for little kids and there are not always slides,swings, monkey bars etc. in a park. There are some parks that are only made for people who like to jog, run and walk. There are so many different kind of parks.

One of the most enjoyable thing you can do is play a sport, like Soccer, Football, Baseball, Tennis etc. There are many places outdoor you can go to play. There are soccer fields made for people who like to play soccer. There are Football fields etc. Sports are not only fun but they also are healthy for you. Like in Soccer there is nothing you can do accept running after the ball. Football is also fun and healthy for you and many other sports. Doing something outdoors is way more fun than doing something inside. If you play video games all the time you can lose your eyes and you can get fat easily.

You can also go to the beach. Beach is the most funnest and enjoyable place. There is sand. ocean, sun, waves and other fun stuff. if you cant swim you can also stay in the sand and make a sand castle or something like that. If you do know how to swim you can go to the ocean and swim in the waves and have lots have fun. If you dont want to swim and make sand castle you can just lay on your towel ad enjoy the hot sun. If you are with your friends and family you can also play lots of different games like frisky, Tag, etc. You can play music on a boombox or a speaker and have fun with that.

Another fun activity to do outside is skydiving. If you want to fly skydiving is just the thing for you. It is another one of the most fun outdoor activities but it requires skill and lots of confidence to do a skydive. If you dont know how to open or use a parachute you will not be skydiving alone you will be tied to professional skydiver and you will skydive with him/her. You still need the confidence to skydive or you can have a heart attack or you can pass out and passing out in the midair is not very good for you, you can break your neck with the air pressure or die.

Skydiving is not really healthy but it still is fun and enjoyable.

Hiking is also one of the outdoor activity and it is really fun. In hiking you can go to mountain peeks or just walk to the middle of a mountain. Hiking is similar to rock climbing but you dont have to climb rocks you just have to walk on the track and and have fun. hiking is also one one of healthy outdoor activities. Once you reach your goal you can enjoy the view and be proud of yourself. Hiking is not an easy thing to do there are many rocks and unstable ground on the way but if you do hiking often it will be easy for you.

Camping is also one of the outdoor activities. camping is fun and enjoyable but it is also dangerous and risky. Camping is when you alone or with your friends go to a forest or camping spot and live there in a tent for one or four days. camping is so much fun especially if you are with your friends or family. you can cook yourself food, enjoy the nature etc. If you like nature camping is just the thing for you. camping can be dangerous and risky because there are a lot of dangerous animals in the woods like lion, bear etc. but if you pick the right camping spot for yourself then there is no danger. many camping spots are where there are less harmful animals.

Outdoor activities are fun to do. Most people dont them because they waste all of there time time on video games and indoor stuff. Most people dont like nature and the are discussed of it. outdoor activities are fun and healthy for you they can keep you in shape and you can have the time of your life.

B8AD03895BE6,"I disagree with school the board of adding one an half hour each day to school. Students would have more class work like math or home work. Students would have more drama each day at school. Also, students have other thing to do for example they might have to go see their family. Having a extra half an hour would not be good for the school because students would not be focus in class.

First, students would have more class work. They, would have more projects, more class work students would have a hard time focusing when doing their class work. Students would have a hard time with home work or studying. For instances many of the students would have to study after they did class work they would not want to study in the mean time they would want to take a break. Students would not like to have in extra half an hour.

Second, students would have more drama every day at school because of the extra half an hour. Students would go around the school an start drama every where then, students would have a hard time focusing in class. Then, their grades would start going down. Although having an extra half an hour would have many problems students would most likely have more drama then ever before.

Lastly, having an extra half an hour students would not like having it because students would be messing thing, such as football games, soccer games maybe even a cook out at the park with their family. Having an extra hour would not be so good because students then, would be messing the thing they do not want to mess. Having an extra half an hour would then be a problem because it would be more work, drama and other thing.

Also having the extra half an hour would change every thing students then, would not have time to do the thing they like to do like going to their friend house or play outside, because of the extra half an hour.

In conclusion having the school board plan to add one an half hour to the school each day would mean that students would not want to come to school. Because, of the extra half an hour students would have to wake up in the morning and thing about the school extra half an hour and students would have more class work, study more for a subject.

B9733BDA883E,"High school the place where we can all do anything we want and just a step before going to college, or at least this is what a lot of middle schoolers think. In high school we take so many classes that are required and those classes are supposed to open up doors and get us closer to our goals. But, classes like arts, music or drama will give us something that we cannot get from others classes. These classes are like a little break, just a whole class to forget about having to write an essay or doing some long math equations and, instead just have fun with friends and enjoy singing, painting and even acting. These classes teach the students how to socialize and communicate with others.

High school is not as easy as some would think, students usually get really stressed because they have to pass their classes, their Sols and start getting prepare for college all at the same time. There is where classes like this can give a little opening to reduce some of that stress. Usually the environment in this classes is always joyful and fun, it is a place where students can learn through socializing and having fun. Who knows may be students would never think they like music but after some months taking music they would find out they love it and decide to become a musician and that can also happens with art and even drama. Classes like this not only give a little time off all the stress and pressure from high classes but also can give lessons to students that they would never even imagined they would learn.

Now, think about a extremely coy student who has never had the confidence to speak up in class not even to ask a question their math class, we know we all have asked something in math is just a class that at least a question per unit seems mandatory. However, how can that same student later on give a speech or have the valor to push himself up in a big company if he never has learned how to properly communicate. Even if he has huge talent and the brain of a genius he will never be successful. In life being able to express ourselves is something required, something that we have to do if we want to move keep moving up our hill path. Nothing will be easy but communication is a social skill we all have to learn.

Many will not agree on this and can will make strong arguments on how this classes are a waste of time. That after all we do not get anything from this classes and students just see these classes as a place to hang around with friends and procrastinating for 90 minutes. well, what about those students that do not have friends, students that always sit back in a corner and the teacher has never get him to say something. The students no one has ever heard from, or sometimes even noticed they are there. Shouldn't school concern about them, shouldn't school be the place where they can grow and open up their winds to start flying on their sky of opportunities.

""Tu voz habre puertas"" It is something i heard from a commercial once i was watching TV with my mom, it means ""Your voice opens up doors"" but those doors will never open if we open our mouths to ask questions that will give us answers those answers will impulse us further in life.

I myself have gone through that where had gone to an alternative school so i could have more time to work in the day and come home to do some of my courses. Many people say education is the number one thing you should worried about and thats right, though some kids can't cause they have to help there family to provide in relation to paying some bills, put food on the table or picking up there siblings. providing school to be done at home will help the kids that have to go through all of this.

high school can be hard at times work is stressful some kids hate to having to get up early is hard for them so they miss out in some of class time. You keep missing some of class every day it can turn into hour's of class time that you missed, also can effect in the way you are learning having more time in your day to work can help you for there you are learning at your own paste, not the teachers. Some students that learn slow. takes time for them to learn one thing and by then the teacher is on the next unit there learning about. everyone has there own way that they learn better students that are fast learners wish that they can learn everything faster to get the class over with to go on to the next. those students can get classes online so they could do them at home to get the most credits they want this would also help them graduate faster.

Very few kids know what they want to work as for there career. Doing online classes can help these students graduate earlier to go the school they want to go to, or there career they want to lean on. This can help these students out in many ways. Going into a career path the earliest you can is a great thing you can get more time to learn and get good at to what you want to be doing like working become a master tech the younger you are the more experience you could have when you get older. The more chances you can get to become the best master tech at your location. Many students in high school learn in there own way also are smart in there own way graduating early can help students to become what they want to be the most.

B9F6B348FC3A,"In my experience I don't disagree, that Emerson thing that mastered will never get him grow.

First reason, all people get mastered and that stop them to grow in something that they tried to do,For example if you are doing like your own job, and you are the manager you will see all the product that you are selling is going down, and you job it's not going well, of curse, you will be in unless to try sell other product and your stored that will happened to you and you stored that you will fell terrible and you will you not valuable to continue in you job because you are so tager to see that you job is going down not going up.

Second reason, Mastered is like you are in favor of something and your friend fight to tell you that you are round with what are you trying to do, After your friend try to tell you that you was so round you undated that you was round, them you tried to do the thing right but, you are you get in mastered and that make you to not have other change to tried again, everyone are unless to try something that they already mastered and, something for example you are teenager and you are is school and you did a test and you get bad scored of curse you feel so bad and you will no tried to retake your test again that having mastered .

Third reason, being scared to try again something that you love and that you thing if you try again that will be a same way that you did the first time, but went you try again, you will have more experience because you will try to not get the same mistake that you got first time, and will have to look so careful to not get the same mistake because you have more experiences. we all can do the thing many time the thing is that you have to believe in you,

and you will look that you will grow not matter how hart and, how many time you get upset, you have to be positive and to be screed if already have mastered.

Conclusion,It's that you never give up at what are tried, not matter how many time or change you take you feel that you get in mastered you always will have other change to start and trust that you can believe that you can do it because that's all that you need to start again.

You will always respect others,yourself and properties.

It's really important to follow those lessons because when your interviewing for a job or something like that you are gonna use those rules and life skills and show that your responsible and care about your future. when your going out with your friends like heading to the movies your gonna show the workers respect and kindness. Kindness is another example of a lesson. That my family always taught me and others as well bacause they know others like it when you give them respect.

BAAFCD5BD313,"Im agree so the student can basically learn more on this time, but if it is putting one hour and half more should give some type of food or snack for them, because on this time the student will be hungry and too tired to stay on school studding, but i'm agree with idea because a lot of parents or guardians go to work early and just come back tonight and cannot stay home for caring they children and this one and half hour it will be to much helpful for the parent/guardians and also teachers who like to teach.

Will be helpful for the learning of the kids because all the hours on school is good for the learning and you can learn more and more all days on school in this time, and when they put this one hour and half it will be good for all because also the family as the teacher like too see that person is learning something different that you teach them to do it.

Getting perspective about the life, and will know that life is not that easy because it have they good this and they bad things happening all time around them.

When they put more time for the school the student can enjoy what they want and what they like example:Sports, Math, Science, Technology, English, Arts, Library or chess club that is the examples what the student can choose, they whatever he wants for their fun on that time and this good time will open the mind of the kids.

Because of this time they can like more school and he can stay everyday and also can choose what you like and what you want to do it for learning different things on school, is not too much time but but they gonna have a lot of fun and and this open the eye of them so they can see that school is not just boring for them ,but you can also have a lot of fun.

If i wold give a suggestion or a complement on this i just will say it about snack for the people who is staying more time than others, because it will provide that the student do not get weakness, sickness or heading, for some reason this can be affected if you do not eat something all day .",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0

BB8064D7B327,"My friend is home schooled because she use to get bullied a lot so she wanted to drop out, she could'nt deal with it anymore. Her counselor gave her a better option taking online classes because she had very good grades and she wanted her to graduate and have a good future. In some schools they offer distant learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think getting home schooled is a good benefit for students who have situations at school, for student drop outs, and it's easier and quicker.

The primary reason on why it's a good benefit, it's that it helps you if you have bad situations at school such as you always get into fights with other students, you are getting harassed or bullied, you have problems with your teachers, or you think you're wasting your time and you could be working and getting money. Having online classes can help you stay out of trouble or helps you stop what ever you are dealing with. Not only it stops the situation but can help you improve and graduating with no problem. If you are having problems talk to your counselor and ask for a possibility for online classes or your parents if you can get home schooled.

Secondly, it benefits the students who are dropping out of school. Most of the students who are dropping out are for financial reasons like, they want to help there family so, they drop out and start working or some teens get pregnant at a young age and there parents most likely they dont support them or help them in anything that they need so, it causes them to drop out. It helps them further there knowledge and can possibly get a better job. It makes them feel happy knowing they can finish school because they know they already making a decision by dropping out but they can still graduate by taking online classes. I remember when i was at student counseling aide and one day a student came to ask me where should he leave his laptop because he was planning to drop out, he looked upset. Generic_Name ask him why? he answered ""i wanna help my family out they dont have any money right now"" she gave him an option for online classes he didnt know it was possible to do that and It made him happy.

Finally, getting home schooled is easier and quicker. You can take your classes when ever you are free. If you need to take a break, you can and continue when ever you are ready. it's non-stressful comparing to regular school. Its proven that getting home schooled its less stressful than regular school. Generic_Name is a science teacher at SCHOOL_NAME he said ""88% students are stressed about school because of homework and not having to finish assignments on time"". He also said ""only 5% are stressed when they are home schooled"". In conclusion, it's less stressful and help you feel non-pressured while you are taking your online classes. It also, gives you free time and gives you advantage to do what ever you like. You get to be home and relax wake up when ever you like to, do your classes take brakes if you would like to, too me it sounds amazing!

Some people might say that getting home schooled is bad because if you have any questions you dont have a teacher to ask or a physical teacher to help you understand the topic you are learning about but it's a one on one class. There's no students just you and your instructor, it helps you focus which i personally think it will help you more comparing sitting in a class room with your friends not paying attention, playing around or not getting work done. I think it's a good benefit having online classes because it helps with people who have bad situations at school, people who are planning to drop out and its a fast and easier way to get your classes done.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5
BBE8AE3B2B09,"- Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years?

In my opinion it is not a good idea because the normal time to be in school and the normal and traditional years to spend in high school is four years. Graduating early is not a bad idea but neither is a good idea, why? because some students need to learn more before graduating. In school you just dont learn math or English, for example you also learn:

How to save up money for a better future

How to have a better behavior

You learn how to spell some stuff correctly

How to write essays

There is a lot that you must know before graduating. Most of these stuff you learn in high school, and yes it might be a possibility that you can just learn all of that in three years by doing extra tests maybe staying after school, extra work, and not having any elective classes. Most of the teenagers would love to graduate a year early but doing all that stuff its a lot of stress, maybe instead of enjoying the weekends with your friends or family you just stay home finishing work from school. Some teenagers also have a job after school and doing extra work not spending time with your family nor friends can stress you a lot take a lot of time and yeah it could be worth it but what if you dont pass any of those classes or you do but graduate without even knowing whats the difference between a debit card and a credit card. In my opinion graduating early should not even be allowed because for example i have this one friend that is doing that and taking extra classes, she doesnt have any elective classes, on the weekends she doesnt go out nor spends time with her family, every time i see her instead of seeing her happy i see her stressed and tired, because she works and comes to school but shes most likely graduating this year and that something that you should be proud of, thats something that is going to help you a lot in a future and you can also start saving up money earlier than you thought, but in a future when you look back and remember your high school moments you wont have cute or fun moments to remember all you will remember is ow hard you used to work to get there and how many times you missed maybe a family dinner or a family reunion or a friends sleepover. Graduating early is actually good because you can have a better future but graduating early wont let you enjoy your life right now that we are young. Honestly i thought about graduating early one time and i told one of my friends and all he said was "" If you know you wont regret it in a future go ahead"" that got to my head a lot because this age that we are in now, is only once there wont be no other chance to go back and be 17 years old again, and to enjoy your parents and the time that you have with them right now. Basically my option is no, it is not a good idea to graduate early.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0
BC0703638937,"Haven't you got an advice from multiple adults in your daily life? Most of the times I believe that people ask for multiple advice from multiple people because they want their adive to impact them in a certain way. However, sometimes one person cannot be convinced by one voice they like to hear multiple voices to be convinced. Most often people are not motivated by themselves which would make it harder for them to be motivated by a single voice because those people needs to hear multiple opinions to make them better or motivated. So let's say that this one person likes to change his or her life and become more motivated, be in the best shape of his or her life, so he or she ask about 10 people how to get motivated and how to work hard to achieve your dreams. Hearing motivating and powerful words from other people can impact your life without you even knowing.

He gets about the same advice from people as he did from the people before and as he heard all of those people talk about the same topic now he or she would be motivated because sometimes not only one voice but two would put a big impact on someone's life and help them. My teachers, friends, family, and all of the people I've met in my life had gave an advice that I heard and took their advice because it meant something to me and it was deep. I would want more people to give me advice that can impact my life, for example my friend's dad always gives him advises but he has hear his dad tell him the same advice over and over again at the end of the day he will get bored and not listen to his dad's advice which would impact him negatively.

Sometimes life gets hard to certain people and they would like to hear advice from multiple people which will impact them in a positive or a negative way depends on who they ask advice from. For example if I were to ask advice from my brother all the time he would just repeat everything he said from before and that would not help me at all, after all they say ""two brain is better than one.""

Listening to other people's advises can impact you in a way that would make you do the right thing in the future and not only it can impact you it can impact the people around you. You could also use the people's advises you heard and give that advice to another person that also needs to hear it.

Seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters much better because you can get many good ideas from people who had experiences before and know better than you.

Making your own decisions can make your life worst. Also, it's not good for young people to make their own decisions. For example, I know one boy he is 17 years old.

BD9FE34E4670,"I agree with this statement, because one there's no knowledge without imagination, secondly Albert

Einstein has made many inventions and he has succeeded, and lastly you can be creative with your imagination. one reason, is there is no knowledge without imagination, because your have to be open minded about things. Imagination isnt just a picture in your head. knowledge is something to see, and think about. its not hard to use your imagination its fun, because you can think about anything you want. even if you have to write a essay, then you need to use your imagination as well. Many people invent things, but before they make it they think about what they want to make, and they imagine what what they want. People invented cars, motorcycles, bikes, and skateboards, But before they made all those things they drew it out they took there imagination, and put it on a peace of paper.

My second reason is Albert Einstein invented many things he might of failed on some, but he succeeded on many. He said "" imagination is more important than knowledge"" he made that statement because he used it to make his creations great. It helped him on many things. and it can help us too. For example if your are writing something, you have to use your imagination on it. If you are listening to music, then you are using your imagination as well. Albert Einstein was a very smart man. he had made many things in life, and we use it till now. Even if your thinking about something then your using your imagination too. People had made phones all different types of phones, People have made flip phones, iPhone, and androids they all invented that, and used there minds and creativity to make all that.

My last reason is to be creative with your imagination, I chose this because if your making a book you need to let the reader think, and picture the scene in there mind, or if your reading a book then you have to imagine it in your head instead of just reading it, and doing nothing. Also if your teacher is explaining things to you, then you have to think about what shes saying, and think about what your going to do. for example I once had to make a assay for my teacher, and it was about life bellow water it was pretty hard, and I had to explain what was going on in the ocean. It took a while to make, but I ended up saying that people keep throwing trash in the in the ocean can you imagine how many animals, and creatures are dying every day because of that? I imagined all of it, and people should not throw trash in the ocean. Every time I read a book I saw it all in my head, and it was cool, and fun! Also every time I wanted to draw something, I would have to see it in my head, and see what I should draw. Even if you are trying to make song or some thing, then your have to imagine how the beat is gonna go, and figure out if it sounds good to you. Even if your making a poem then you have to think what rhymes or doesnt rhyme. Also there are doctors that have to see if they can save someone, they have to think and see in there head if they should get this, or that. Everyone uses there imagination there isnt knowledge without imagination. There are kids that get read to, and they imagine whats going on they dont just listen they think about what they hear. That is why I agree with Albert Einstein.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0
BDF13939FA26,"Students may say inactivity is the way to go, However other student say keeping yourself occupied will lead you towards achievement. But staying occupied is the way to go if you wanna be successful and achieve things in life. Sitting around and doing nothing wont lead you to anything sucessful in life.

If your at home sitting around having nothing to do will not help you to be successful. If you try to find something productive to do it will help you in the future. To be productive or to do something productive really does'nt have to be school work related it can be anything like having a job, chores or helping around the community.

Lets say you have home work but you dont feel like doing it, because your used to not doing anything and or are lazy to do it. which means you are more likely to procasanate. On the other hand if your used to doing your work the same day its assigned and or turn it in on time you are less likely to procasanate because you are used to staying occupied and doing all your work.

Many people have their ways of learning certain things. Some may like working in groups because it makes the work easier, bring up their confidence and social life. Others may like working alone because it helps people concentrate, they like to get their work done faster and they don't feel uncomfortable towards other people.

First, Working in groups might make the work easier, help bring up their confidence, or their social life. It can make their work easier by separating the work to make it faster to deal with the work. It can help bring their confidence by talking to other people. It can help them bring courage to make new friends and learn about each other. It can also help them with their social life. Instead of being on their phones they are learning together and getting work done. They are also getting to know each other.

Second, Working alone can help people concentrate in their work, they could be fast workers, and they don't feel uncomfortable towards new people. It can help them by concentrating in their own work to feel more comfortable with themselves. They could be fast workers because they are not being distracted and they can go on their own speed. They won't feel uncomfortable or awkward by other people because some people don't like meeting or being with people. Most of them just want to be alone or with people they might know.

All in all, find what you feel more comfortable with it could be being alone or being in a group to study with people you might want to get to know or with your friends that your comfortable with. Working alone is the best choice for most people because they might be able to work faster, they are fully concentrated in their own hard work and they might just feel comfortable with themselves.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0

BF56324B3A86,"Do you know how many people are unhappy for be someone that they don't are?. At the present time in the world exist millions of people that don't live their life of the way that they want. Sometimes is difficult be yourself in a world where the whole people think that be different is wrong, but the truth is that the greatest accomplishment in the life of each human is be unique and have individuality in all your presence, because be yourself is the goal of the happiness, fight against the prejudice of everyone is not easy and accept you exactly like you are, looks like a war if the whole world is trying to change you.

Many people think that have a success and amazing life is have a lot of money, be an important person or have material things but all this things in really don't matter in the process of be yourself, because a person can have all this things but this things don't define you like a person and this aspects don't give the happiness, and something very important in the life of everyone is that, if you don't have happiness you don't have nothing. Is a fact that at least the 60 percent of people is not happy with their life, but studies affirm that this can change just if they choose be hones with themselves and take out of their life want they don't want. And the first step to be happy is be yourself. The people don't can live being liar with themselves, because this just bring like consequence a miserable life. A person have to accept their personality and their interest based on their thoughts. A serious consequence that the people get if they don't be honest with themselves are diseases like depression, This is a very dangerous problem and one of the most common causes are don't be agreeable with the person or the way that the person is living. For this and many others reasons is that is very difficult be yourself but is the biggest reward.

Alongside of your life you have to make a lot of decisions and is important always hear you. The people cannot allow that someone take decisions for they if that affect who are they.

First is very important know exactly what do you want because that is the same that be happy with yourself.

Always take your own opinion first, is the answer of be really happy because is very easy follow the opinion of the others based in their life's or be influenced for a world that always is trying to make you someone else, someone that they don't are. But at the end what a person want is the answer of be really happy.

Everyone in the world is trying to find their correct way in their life, and be honest about feelings and all mentioned in this paragraph can be the answer to arrive to the goal and be happy with yourself.

Is a fact that actually the world is a constantly war, because the majority of the citizens in the world are trying to fight for their rights and be honest with themselves and also with the whole world. But is true that this is not a easy task. The only person that someone need worry about what they going to think is yourself!, a person don't have to worry about the opinion of the others, just care what do you think!. Unfortunately, not everyone understand this, and sometimes the people wants that the world accept us form the simple fact of be a person. Is very hard be like you really are if millions of people want change your mind and they refuse to accept that everyone is different, that there are things that don't have that be equal and that it's fine, that the diversity is part of a balance. Everyone is here, in their country, in their community to learn about the others, and have respect of they, don't care their race, color, language, traditions, customs and many others things that represent and define a person, this is the correct, not be equal. Nowadays a lot of people is trying to make this world a better place where the prejudices not exist and where each person can be what they want and have the rights that the people need and deserve. Is a difficult battle but without doubt the result is the greatest accomplishment. And is a fact that if the people are happy with how they are, and they accept their form of be, with their qualities and defects, anyone, and studies repeat that anyone can affect you, because you are really on the top of the goal and when you are there nothing can make you go down.

Many philosopher and researchers believe that the problem with the society that don't accept and allow the people that is different, is because since the beginning of the world the people hidden their really feelings and interests for the fear of be rebounded. In part is own fault because the people never said something when something was wrong, but never is late, an actually the majority of the people is trying to change the perspective about what is fine in the world. That is why accept you exactly like you are, looks like a war if the whole world is trying to change you. We have to be strong and don't allow that anyone dispute your decisions. Another reason therefore is hard be yourself is for you, sometime the people are so exigent with themselves, you are your own most hard critical. If everyone would honest with themselves , this would be something normal for the society, but is such difficult accept us, that is seen wrong be unique. We definitely have to change this way of see the circumstances and make it normal.

Is clearly that we have a lot of learn but I think that we going to the correct way. The people have to travel many obstacles for win their individuality and always remember where we are and where we want arrive.

Be yourself, is really difficult if a whole society is telling you that you can not be different and that be unique is wrong, because how you can understand who are you, if anyone give you the chance to know it, but without doubt discover the answer will be the best accomplishment that a person can have because live being you, is the better that could exist, for a complete life.

Getting a bad grade on a test or quiz. Their are kids in middle and high school who study and at times get bad grades. These kids have trouble knowing that they failed their test or quiz. One way to provent this from happen is by having a good mindset. They can deepdown be mad, but if they put tell themselfs that ""i'll try harder next time"" they could do better on the retake or on the next quiz or test. Even when some kids that study a lot and fail some of they overreact during it.

Overreacting is another promble kids have. Some kids overreact by saying ""if i fail this i wont get a job"". Other times kids thing negativly about themselfs and they bring themselfs down. They could be telling theemselfs "" i'm going to fail"" or anything else instand of that they sould try telling them say ""i'm going to try to do my best. They dont know intill they try to do their best.

Having a good mindset can help. Havin a good mindset meaning to think positivly and to know that not having passed their test or anyting in life. That everyone had to start from one place and build on. Other times kids should learn from their mistakes. They might have or might have not fail and they shouldn't put it on themselfs because they could fail if not.

These are ways to provent kids from having a bad attitude to having a good attitude during their difficult time. They should try to be more calm and the should try to not overreact at much. They should also try to have a good mindset during it.",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0
BFAEA615906C,"All individuals should follow their own instincts, and ideas. when trying to build a successful future, people should create their own ideas, make good decisions, and experiece new things by themselves to get more confident in their lifes. However pleople should make their own decisions and manage their ideas to do what they think is correct.

First, people should create their own ideas. although, they have to follow their instincts, and don't led anybody disturb their mind. Think on how they want to improve and try new things. Also seeking ideas from other people is not a very good thing when it won't benefit them. To understand what the role of life is, people should expand their ideas And work out more by themselves.

Second, people should make good decisions. In other words, people should decide what they really want. When people make good decisions they tend to be successful and encourage themselves to keep growing. Decide what people really want, and what can they really do, is very important, since not everyone is able to do what other people can do. Therefore, confidence is the key to make good decisions. We can also say that people need time to think about any bad consequenses that can result from any of their decisions.

Third, people will get more experince. In fact, people know more about life when their experience is greater. Experience will help people to know how to face problems whenever they make a mistake. Also, an important point of experience is that lessons of life won't led people make the same mistake over and over. Correct or incorrect decisions would make people more experienced. That's why, experienced peolple are more likely to success than not experienced peolple in order of the kind of knowledge that they have.

In conclusion, people as builders of their own life, should be independent, and don't wait until someone tell them what to do, and how to do it. Reasonable people would make up good ideas, be careful with any kind of bad decisions, and use experience as a tool to success, and build a great future for them.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5
C05745235FE7,"Is it good idea for high school students, the can graduate in three years instead of traditional four years? Some school distract offer program that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of four years. Most high school students who follow this plan must take courses during the summer or may not be able to take elective courses. If students end up their high school in three year, the would missed most of opportunities that could provide better knowledge and education for them. Students should not require to graduate in three years instead of four years because students could't get enough credits to graduate, and students can not improve their confidence and their knowledge.

To begin with, first reason, students could't receive enough credits to graduate. For example, when college student want to be successful Doctor, he or she must get enough classes during the 7 years to receive approximately credits to get their diploma, if the require to graduate in 5 years, the can't construct enough confidence to be a good Doctor for the community and society. This example shows, students should't graduate early, because the can't developed and improve their life skills, education, and knowledge. If students graduate early, the would get an anxiety and different kinda problems in their life. High school traditional four years is the natural path that can help student to be success and give them more educational opportunities.

Furthermore, second reason, students can't improve or developed their confidence and their knowledge. For example, when the student who graduated early try to do an experiment he/she would't believe their decision and the does't have any positive confidence to get the result successful. This example shows, students should not graduate early, because the would't have any strong confidence to do something successful. Students should't required to graduate in three years instead of traditional four years of high school. If students graduate in three years of high school, the will face to anxiety problems, challenges, and work challenges.

Some people's argue that, students should be require to graduate in three years because students will receive the most opportunity to continue their education skills. For example, when I was in Afghanistan I was about to graduate high school in 2 years, also I had the most opportunities to receive grateful education. However, students should't be require to finish their high school in three years instead of four years because students would be leftover from others and the would never confidence on the experiment and life skills. Students should't graduate in three years, the should take the elective classes to get more information about the world, regions and humans.

In conclusion, Students should not require to graduate in three years instead of four years because students could't get enough credits to graduate, and students can not improve their confidence and their knowledge. However, Some people's argue that, students should be require to graduate in three years because students will receive the most opportunity to continue their education skills.

C1959178FC53,"According to Thomas Jefferson: ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" What he wanna said is that if we are always working and never have free time we will accomplish so much more. We could see that why he is saying this because he is a hard working man and look at what he have done to the world, there is nothing wrong for working hard. But if we are always working and don't spent time for ourselves or time with family then you could accomplish more but you will suffer a lot more for that successful.

For example, when we work hard and don't spent time for our self or we don't have any private time to relax and stop thinking about work, we will get stress and stress led to a lot of thing like can't sleep at night,depressed,or maybe can't eat well. So we definitely have to manage time well between work and time for yourself to maintain doing good work and have a good and healthy life. Like another scientist that work hard like Thomas Edison, his name is Albert Einstein, he work really hard but don't manage time well so he have barely sleep a day. Some even said he only sleep 3 hours a day, and the consequence is he died at the age of 60 because of sickness and he even have autism when he stay awake for too long and talking to his own self. That is why we have to have free time because we don't want to get stress and get tired of our work so it can led to quit job or we getting fired.

Another important thing is that we need to spent time well with our family too because family is where we have the most support from and also the reason why we work for so hard if we don't have time for our family then they will leave us and then, by that time we gonna work and live so hard because we are lonely. And we might suicide or getting depressed and lead us to drugs. Family is what matter in our life and that is why we have to spent good time for them so they can be with us and support us when we need to so we can work harder for. I have an uncle in Generic_City, he is a successful business man, he work for a well-known medical company and and owner of a market but to pay for what he own is his time for his family. He start work at 5 a. m and go home at 11p. m and he never have time for his family. That is why during this summer his wife leave him, his daughter don't wanna see him anymore because he was never there for her, and his son just never call or visit him. Now he is 40 and he is a very success person but after all of that he is still and lonely old man. This is why we need to spent time for our family because after we work so hard in our lives but we dont have family after that we are just lonely peoples that have no one to make our life happy til the rest of it.

i think Thomas Edison quote have nothing wrong with it, and it is true that human can do so more if they are not have idle time. But if we don't have those idle time we will soon face with stress, disease, depressed, loneliness and also suicide, so why we work so hard and don't have free time so we die in miserable ways when we can work hard and play hard too and enjoy our life in a really good way.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
C1ACBD09B2FC,"should our school follow this model after consitering the benefits and disadvantagesto a four day a school week will be not be not because,we will not expend time time with family. We will have a lot homework. It's a long day. children needs to be time. family waiting for children. students have three days a week free and some students start work some not. Students will be focuses to learn a long time i agree but, students had to dangers. I don't think students learn will be just school for good life. Some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. And businesses doesn't have students have a lot homework. Students won't because students some under 18 some over 18. Because students will be hungry, and they can't wait lunch time.

First, We will not expend time with family because, we will have long class and we will stay whole day at school. we will boring and tied we will focus to learn. and children will be free after class so,children going to out side with friend and they play game any area any time they will be happen. If we say you can't go with your friends students start cry and i can't say any think because,students already learn long time.

Second, ""We will have a lot homework'' because, they will be have extra class and subject. They give more homework when they finish class they will come back home but,they are not free they have homework they didn't eat anything they can't talk anybody. they have mind foresters. It's a long day because, students cant,t be stay long time one place. students life will be not eager it's difficult,strenuous. they always thinking about enjoy a day and they will to go to new place and some think learn new subject. some students doesn't boring because they can used phone if they are free they pay song they are looking movies,they were talk to friends and if have lunch time they will go to to side and enjoy to lunch but,not every body.

Third, family waiting for children because,some children not above the 18. who not be above the 18 there needs to be parents when they are going to the school bus and come back to home. there parents can go to work because,class to be long but, they will come back to work when children come back home. Some time precepale call to mom and dad emergency they can't go to schools because, there parents think about children come to late so,they are will go to out side and fair way. Some students have work some not if they are working it's to be good because,they got money and experience how to work who to talk to costumer and help each their, make new friend,talk to different languages. Some students working they get money,they does't want to go to class because,they have extra money when students want they gone find anything they have a lot of money. If students left work students have money and student thinking about school then better then money. Students not interest for learn.

Last,Students will be accuse to learn a long time i agree but, students will be danger because, students have a lot of treble and they have mind they will learn many thing. they cachap imidetly but,every think same time and they talking just English if they want to learn another languages but,they do't have info time. So, if students long time at school they will be boring and they feel uncomfortable. i know some students want learn very excite. Now at schools has a subject in school a computer is there. computer has electrical energy. all students used computer and phone they did't know about computer,phones are dangers,but all students used because every thing election system. computers,phone helps a lot there have everything. ex: cell Facebook, map,dictionaries, calculated, document every think in there. So, all students use phone but ,they lose eyes, mind. i know a cell phone helps communication goes on but, it's dangers.

Finely,I don't think students learn is just school for good life because, at school for teacher give some idea how to learn .students know about what hempen out side because students all the time at school. If students have more time students learn friends,and mom,dad sister,brother there get some knowledge. businesses have adopted a four -day work week and students for day a week and students have four- day week it's different students students have dungarees and students have a lot homework students learn some thin but business have they know already know that.

C1BED9EF3630,"Most high school students prefer to do their regular four years of high school and enter college after they graduate and apply for college during their senior year to get help from their counselors and school teachers. Graduate early could be difficult for adolescents because not everyone have the same way of learning and some can be more faster than others. School districts should let the students decide whether they want to graduate early or not and give them more freedom to do want they want about their future. students that do their traditional four years do not follow this plan because it can bring pressure and anxiety, they would have to do extra work and,

they are able to pick elective classes.

Every student know that it is very important to pass their classes and be aware of how many credits they have in order to graduate. If you want to graduate early this issue can be dangerous because it can bring anxiety and pressure to adolescents during their high school years. Graduate early can make your life difficult because anxiety combine with pressure frequently gives mental problems. Some parents are constantly checking grades and that can be very frustrated towards their kids and hard to handle because they are often being told to do well and if they don't their guardians limit important items from them and usually control their life because they don't get good grades.

The fear to be behind and getting low grades are always present in students but the worries should be less for those that do not graduate early. teachers recommend to the students to take extra courses during the summer or evenings to advanced in their classes. on account of doing four years of high school you dont need to do extra work. In spite of that you still need to do your assignments at the same time but being not in a rush like the others. Every person should be responsible for their own work even if they have to do it later on it doesn't matter.

The school provides the students the opportunity to take a new subject that they haven't took before. by given them the chance to every student to choose elective courses unfortunately for those that graduate early don't have the same option because it is a waste of time receiving a class you don't need; otherwise you can take take as many as you want to challenge yourself and become better at any new topic you want to learn.

In conclusion it is a better idea if students do their traditional four years of high school. In case they need help from their teachers and schools they can get support from both. Anxiety and pressure are serious problems that any student have to pass through because it distract them from their learning and the attention of the students is also taken away. Extra time should not be used to do extra work because the kids need have to do their assignments and barely have time to do extra courses.

Everyone should have elective classes because is a good way to learn new activities in school and get distracted from your most important classes that you are taking during the school year.     ",3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0
C1E9D98B3613,"I personally agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson with his quote saying ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" The reason i agree is because I believe that you have to set your goals higher, if mastered something already. Its always alright to fail trying to master your goal because nobody is perfect. You also need to try different goals to master so youre good at several things.

The first reason why i believe you should set your goal higher, if you have already mastered your goal is because if you keep doing the same thing youve done over and over and have already done great at it, you will not see any growth in you. For example if i was in a soccer team and played for a rec team. Which rec is when you sign up and get put on a team with no tryouts. If i played and score almost every game and always outplayed my opponents. I wouldnt grow as a soccer player because the opponents would be easy for me and wouldnt be a challenge so i would have to set my goal higher. For a higher goal i would have to move up to travel to see growth in me and have a challenge in the game.

I believe that people also disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because they are scared to set there goal higher when they have already mastered it. The reason i think this is because they are embarrassed to fail and not do something right. When i'm reaching a goal of mine like getting three goals in the net in a soccer game. I work hard to try to accomplish my goal so i can master it and score three goals every single game. Sometimes i fail and dont score three goals but i always tell my self its alright because when youre reaching a goal you will fail at least once or probably more then once. Which makes me work harder. Nobody is perfect and always a good thing to fail to learn about your mistakes.

The last reason why i agree is because you have to try to master different things in life. Sticking with the same thing you mastered will just not make you good at anything else. Its always great to have different things youre good at because you can do a lot of other things. If you dont like any of the goals you want to master and cant reach it. Its always great to have other ones along the other one youre trying to reach because i know a lot of people change their thoughts and want to do more then one goal at a time.

You have to set your goals higher if mastered something so you can see growth in yourself. When setting your goals higher you will fail at least once, you shouldnt worry because it makes you learn about your mistakes and so you wont do what you did to make you fail. Also you have to try different things to master to be good at several things in life. This is why i agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson quote he wrote.      ",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5

Even if my life is the worse one I going to take care of all my decesions sometimes we can ask at someone for a opinion maybe, because the person is more older then me but is only a opinion you're not gaving authorities at all at the person to go and make your decisions and then take care of all your stuff.

In my conclusion is better if you take care of your on stuff doesn't matter how hard that it, is your life and you are the only one that knows how to deal with everything that you have done so, this is my last decision people should make their own decisions. ",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5

Because when i work in group who talk a lot i cannot focus on my work or they are just talking stupid stuff and trying to be funny there is when i get mad or when they trying to put me in there conversion that i do not care because if i am not talking to you or to the group that mean i am good and i do not need you or i dont need your opinion.

C3429FEF8AEE,"I recently learned that some educators feel like the summer break is to long and that the students do not retain information as easily when they return to fall some people argue that there should be year-round schools. where there would be 3-4 week break in the summer a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall. In my opinion summer vacation should remain longer. I truly believe that a longer summer vacation can be beneficial for those students that want to work and save money when winter comes.

One reason why summer vacation should be remain long is that when school ends some students choose to work on summer vacation to save as much money as they can, so they can stay in their house when winter comes. If they have only 3-4 week of break they will not be able to save money when winter comes. Having to work during winter is difficult for those students that do not like winter. In instance when I started to work I did not like to work in winter days. In my country the weather it is hot and I am adapted to my country's weather not to cold weather.

Another reason is that when winter comes and it snows sometimes the roads are too slippery some students drive during the snow days if they work during winter season they might have an accident due to the weather. If they work during the summer they will nothave to work during winter days.

However, some students will argue that is better a shorter summer break than a longer break,

a longer summer break can be helpful to do a lot of things such as, work or relax.

Thank you for considering my opinion on this matter if you have any questions let me know and I will happy to talk about this matter.

C3668997E921,"If I were to be asked to share a lesson with elementary school students it would be how to be respectful, to always learn and, be good communicators.

One of the first lessons I'll share with a student would be, being respectful. Being respectful is important to you and the people that surround you. For an example, you cant just go up to your teacher and tell them ""give me a pencil"" you should tell them ""may I please have a pencil"". Also if you don't be respectful to other people, people will not be respectful to you. The word ""respectful"" is not the only word you can use there's other words like nice, polite, and many other words, these ""other words"" are like branches of a tree that goes up to the main stem which is ""respect"".

Another lesson I would share would be to always learn, because in life it's always important to learn. To learn can be very hard or easy because how you learn is how you move along in life. For an example, when you first stared to walk how did you do it, by learning. Another example is, when your in school your always learning new things like math, history and, writing. Learning can be fun or boring, but in life you always need to learn for opportunities for jobs. The more you learn the better opportunities you'll get.

Lastly, being good communicators. In life you'll always have to communicate if it's your friends, teachers or your family, you'll always be communicating. For an example, I can't communicate with people, for me its very hard and every year goes by and it makes it more difficult to learn. When I came to my new school it was so hard to meet new people and I don't want anyone to suffer how I did but I learned and now I feel better I have new friends and if I never communicated then I would of just stay quite. A way for you to be a better communicator is to talk more and talk to new people, its an other great way to make new friends.

And those would be the things I would share to elementary school students to always learn, to be respectful and, be good communicators ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0
C37F09E24836,"In some School's not only do teacher's assist student's but now student's beginning do the same for younger one's at School. Some School's have program's that teacher's allow student's to pair up with younger one's at the Elementary School's. In this program student's do game's read book's and so much more exiting activities. They do this to help out younger students that are just beginning school and are scared and don't know what to do in School or how to react because of their first time being in School. The older student's assist out the younger one's on how to read, comprehend and to get the understanding of how books are read and what they could be used for in their future life, this is the reason older students are so helpful and useful.

Another amazing this program is useful is because for those student's that are home alone and have no older brother's or sister's, this program helps them get a understanding of how it feels having sibling's at home. This program entertains and not only that but also influence's younger student's on how it feels having a sibling at home and the amazing time spend with each other as well. I think this is a wonderful and interesting idea because it interests kids and makes them want to return to School and love School if they are having second thoughts about School, for example if they do not like it and don't want to return, having a buddy might want to change their mind because they can only imagine the fun and exiting time they can have with their buddy!

Teachers's, Principal's and other member's like the School bored did a smart plan of creating this fantastic program of older student's assisting out the younger student's and teaching them a thing or two about certain things. Younger student's look up to the older student's and the older student's are known as role models because they are much more mature and that is why younger ones look up to them. The reason why this program is helpful for both younger and older student's is because this program impacts both younger and older student's, it impacts the younger ones because it teaches them how to read and write and it impacts the older student's because they learn how to assist younger ones and how to communicate with them. This great program will help out student's right now in class and also they will learn how to use these skills in a daily life and maybe on their everyday lifestyle and job's.

When a student or any person assist out another, at the end they will always feel proud about their self's and they will want to keep on helping others in their daily life. That is why they might have this program so student's can get the feeling of how it feels helping out someone and so the younger student's can learn how to read and get the feeling of how it the sensation would feel if they had sibling's at home. They might fight but at the end they will later then respect each other and they will learn how to communicate with each other. School is important because student's learn from their mistakes and then next time the same problems happen to them they will learn from it and make it better then the first time. They learn and learn so when a student is a fully grown adult they know what is expected of them and how to assist other's if needed also they will be more mature and will know how to act. if someone is out their struggling or having a difficulty time doing something, the adult that was ones a students and helped out younger student's will automatically know what to do and how to help the one's that will need help. This is the reason this program is so helpful and I hope they keep having these things for student's in the past and will continue to help them in the future.",3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5
C41E40F2D803,"Do you know how many careers' choices you have when you enter to high school? Most of the new students in high start thinking about what career they would like to take after they finish high school. Although some say students should not commit to a career at a young age because make students feel pressure, actually students should commit to a career at a young age because help students to preparate for the future and they have more time to choose the career they like.

Although some say students should not commit to a career at a young age because make students feel pressure. In most cases students become stressed because of their parents telling them to start selecting a career at a young age. Students behavior change; However their grades get affect it bacause of the stress and pressure. Some people say that school should talk to students' parents, so students don't feel pressure selecting a career at a young age. When the parents know they have a lot time before collage.

First reason why students should commit a career at a young age because help students preparate for the future and let them know what is better for them. Students preparation is base on saving money to pay for collage. They can see what is better for them; In other words what career benefit them more and if they allowed to pay it. Students can know early where they can get help either from their parents, or if they has to work for the career that they want. Students can talk with their parents aboout a student loans too.

Second reason why students should commit a career at a young age because they have more time to look for a career that they like more. They have more time to look for a career with the charateristics they like. Students have more time to save money. They can know other careers where they can get a good pay. Teachers can help students to get a good career base in their Knowledge.

In conclusion students should commit a career at a young age bacause as I said helps the students to preparate. The time is one of the best reason that help them. The knowledge from other people help the students what is better. Students dont get pressure also they have more oppurtunities. Students should commit a career at a young age because is one of the best choice they can do.                                          ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5

He's known as a jerk and self-center person in school. When he's alone in class he's a quite and nice person to be around. One day another classmate of mine told me that she saw him having dinner with his family at a restaurant and wasn't acting out. One time I saw him help a old lady at the family food market at school;carry her grocery bags for her. First impression can change because people actions speak louder than words, your just getting to know someone, and you think know someone better than anyone else.

Actions speak louder than words because you may think you may know someone by what they say to you,but their actions their are as important as well. For example colleges are not only looking at your grades but they also look into what clubs you join. Because colleges want to find interesting people to recruit. Our president is also a prime example because he kept on saying ""Let's build a wall."", and he did it. It shows what kind of person our president is. When people ask a upset or angry person ""Are you okay?"" the person always reply with ""I'm fine."". Even if there body language shows their not.

Your just getting to know someone,If your trying to get know a new student in school by you saying hi to them, but they don't say hi back. It doesn't make they a rude person once you try to talk to them. Just image being a new student; who move to a school that everyone knows eachother since they were kids. Its much worst for the students that don't speak english as their first language to make a very good impression as well. People who choose to get a pet have to get know your pet in order to know their pet's wants,habits, personality and needs, also their dislikes. If you want a loving relationship with your dog, cat or anyother pet. It all starts with getting to know them first and giving love to them.

Inclusion, first impressions can be change because people actions speak louder than words, your just getting to know someone,and you think you may know someone better than anyone else.

C4A874260D21,"Most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and when they return in the fall, they become more lazy and they can't retain information as easily when they were in school.

Summer break is the only long break that the school gave to the students to do all the things that they couldn't do during the school year and they can rest for a long preiod. I don't agree for these reasons:

First, A lot of students wants to work during the school year or do other things that take more time to do, but they can't do it because they got too much homework or they need to study for a tests that they have that week and they just had time for that. So in Summer break they got 3 months so they can work and do more things that they couldn't do during the school year. Students can work and have more experiences that can help them when they want to apply for another work that is much better for them and learn more things.

Next, Students needs a break after the school year. Most of the students get stressed for all the works and tests the teachers gave to them, their brains needs to relax and rest for a preiod time because it's not good to be always working, they got tired too. So Summer break is the best period to relax and distract for a period time. Students can go to the beach and have fun, Enjoy more time with their famillys, hang out with their friends, go visit new places, too much things they can do in this break and the weather is perfect too.

Finally, In Summer break the students don't worry about works or tests they may have need to present when the break is end. When they have Fall, Winter or Spring break the school gave to them just one week and in that week most of the teachers gave to the students works and tests they need to make after the week breaks, so in conclusion they don't have breaks because they need to study or do works that the school gave to the students. In Summer they don't need to worry about that and enjoy the time they got.

Some persons may don't agree with me because they think that have more breaks during the school year is better for students, but they need to know that the students got works during that breaks and they need to study for tests that they need to make after the week break, so in summary, they don't got that time to relax and give a time period to their brains so they can rest.

In conclusion, Summer break is the only long period that the students got to relax and they can do so many things that they couldn't do during the school year because of all the works they got and test that they need to study for. So Summer break needs to stay like that and is the best season for students so they can enjoy and have fun in their long break.",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0
C53073A5A9CB,"I am going to talk about a prompt that Tomas Jefferson wrote, about being idle or always doing something;

Idle or active?

, I think that when you are active you can make and accomplish the duties that you have faster and better.

The reason that i think being active is better, Is because you will get accustomed to always do something and that can help you in your future in your homework, house duties, and in your future job; and i know that being idle does not help you to grow as someone that is uses full to the society, because one of my cousins does absolutely nothing and he start to get into a lot of problems with our family.

If you are always active you are showing to the people that you are someone they can count on, someone that demonstrate, values like determination, and responsibility; and most of the time people are looking for does type of people to manege a work place, food store,school,and companies.

I also think that active people are more likely to be successful,I am sure that it is true because my father star to work when he was only 9 years old and he was always doing something, and then whit the time he reach to be his own boss doing what he like but never stop doing the duties that he give to himself make him a really responsible person; and that why i think that person how are always active have more potential to succeed.

The reason that idle people are not going to get anywhere for me is because most of the time people are looking for somebody with energy and wants of work and if you are one of the people how are always on the sofa watching television i am sure that you wont be the first choices for them.

In conclusion the reason why i chose the people that are active make more accomplishment in they daily life is because that have more opportunities to show to the word that they are here and that they want to be seen and they want something to do and do it better and that they can reach their goals.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,2.5

Students should commit to a career at a young age because it may have them in school because students may be thinking about there future and then get movtivated to get more done. Students at young age also be invasted in the career they may choose for example being a soccer player, being a basketball player, being a football player etc. This the first reason why students should commit to a career at a young age cause it will help them become a better person in life and also help there future.

Students should also commit to a career because it will help them perpare for life because they will be getting for college and thats a big step from highschool that is there road to succues because when they are in college they will be learing about there future job whiles if students who don't think about there future at a young age will probaly go down hill for them somethng like getting into drugs or getting killed this is a second reason why students should commit to a career at a young age.

Students should commit to a career so that can can have a good life because if you don't think of a career at a young age you will not be good in life there many example like being homeless. Therefore students should start thinking about a career because it would be coming so fast.

C5E45F477A84,"Have you ever met someone, or an interviewer, and show a good or bad impression to them? People think that first impression can be changed because everybody has a second chance. While others think that first impression can not be changed because it shows who you are. I agree to the motion that first impression are impossible to change because it shows your personality, your attitude and who you are.

Firstly, first impressions are impossible to change because it shows your personality. I had a friend, who dressed inappopriartely to an interview for her job. But to her surprise she did not get the job because of how she dressed. Also after a while, she couldn't get any job elsewhere. This means that whenever you go somewhere, you should dress appropriately, check how you use your tone with others, so people will know that you are a good person, respectful, can take responsibiliy for your actions and shows how mature you are. Not only does first impressions show your personality, however, it shows your attitude.

Additionally, showing your attitude is most likely impossible to change. I remember I used to disrespect, fight and insult others when they did something to me I didn't like or even if they needed help from me. I met this old lady and she asked for my help then I told her that I didn't want to and insulted her, then she said to me I am going to have a hard time in life but i didn't take what sh said seriouly and left. As a result of what happened, as I grew up, I tried to change but couldn't because when something goes bad and I knew it was not me, they will all mention my name. And I wish there was someone there to offend me. And thats when I remembered what the old lady told me, I wanted to go ask for forgiveness but unlucky for me she went to heaven and now am left with her curse. Which gives me this conclusion that always respect everyone you see even if you don't know them.

First impressions also shows the kind of person you really are.

Furthermore, your impressions shows who you are. Not long ago, this was this lady on the news. When i heard the news it shocked me because she went to a store, picked an ice cream from the fridge, licked it, and put it back in the fridge without paying for it. This obviously shows that, she ruined her reputation in public and everywhere. Now everyone knows who she really is. Not only did it ruined reputation but she brought a shame to herself, her family, and also her native country. First impressions are impossible to change.

Lastly, it is valid that first impressions can be changed because everyone has a second chance. But not really because sometimes your impressions towards someone stays the same even if you change. Others will think you are not your self today and also others will think it's a good thing but not everyone depending on what impression you made on your first time meeting. So I say that first impressions likely impossible to change.

In a Nutshell, showing your character, who you are, and your behaviour are impossible to change on your first impression. Mostly first impressions are not easy to change. Would you on your first impression be respectful or disrespectful, appopriate or inoppopriate, and be willing to take responsiblity of the concequences of you on seeing someone older than you, are you?",4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,3.5,3.5

To sum it all up I use sowing to have a choice if wether I want to have it for a career or not, for emergencies, to help out others, save money. make a lot of money, and not be a failure.

One question has been asked during a long time. Is it better to work alone or to work in a group?

Most of the people and analysts have got the conclusion that working in groups could be more beneficial.

A factor the support this idea it is because you get to have different thoughts, ideas and ways to see the life that can help you in bad situations. For example, if you are planning either something as big as a school event, or something as simple as a classroom presentation, there is occasions when you run out of ideas. You can count in the group. They are going to be there giving diverse solutions to the problem, otherwise, by yourself you could be struggling like if you are in road with no exit.

Working in a group sometimes can make you relax, laugh and bring positivism, even in challenging moments or when you are facing stress. Every time you have to work in this way, you do not spend boring moments. There will be always something to talk about. You and your team would be saving memories that in a future would be a moment of laugh.

Another fact about working in group is that you get to finish the work in a faster. More people working in the a series of things in a quickly way than just one, makes a big difference. It will give space to the creativity, where you can practice more, give details to the work or even do new creations.

Because you are working in a team you do not focus only in ""I"" you open your mind and start thinking in ""we"". This is going to be useful in the future, when you go out to the real world. Working with other people, you have to deal with different personalities and thoughts. The team working abilities are going to be place in your mind.

When as a team all your tasks are completed you will find a great euphoria in the results. It is going to make everyone proud of themselves and also it is going to be a method to keep pushing them up and never give up.

Sometimes when you get to work in a group it might sound or seem a difficult task. But instead, you learned new experiences and new abilities. It become a helpful tool to develop character and to grow as a person. You have to learn how to speak with the people and how to tell your ideas in a clear manner. That is why many people agreed that working in teams brings more benefits than just working alone.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5

The other percentage of people are indoors sleeping, watching TV, or playing video games. I personally can do both, there are other days when I just want to stay in the house and there are other days when I want to get out the house and do things like playing soccer with my brother and father. Enjoyable ways to spend you time outdoors can be going to festivals hanging out with friend or even reading a book in the park.

Some interesting and enjoyable outdoor activities that I like doing is going to the zoo, going on a picnic, hanging out with friends and family, playing some type of sport, or visiting a amusement park.

my dad and brother we always go to the park and play with my cousin then after that we would go out to eat and its better than sitting home all day and doing nothing.

These activities can be enjoyable because you together with family and friends and that can make things fun. People can use these activities to take their minds off certain situation like problem at home or something going on at school . People can use going to the park and reading a book as an escape of reality and life and going into their imagination. There are many reason why these activities can be enjoyable. Just sitting home all day doing nothing can cause you to be lazy and hide away from the world but also going outside is good for you mental growth. My mother has always told my sibings and I that we should go outside more often and I think to myself why is it important for us to go outside if there are more problems in the world the being indoors.

I think that being outdoors can help you open you mind up more to new things and experiences. For example my friend PROPER_NAME had skin cancer and he was so scared of being out side and he wanted to hangout with his friends, play sports, and go to the park and have picnic. This story is what motivates me to go out side because I dont want the freedom of going outside to be taken away.

everyone like a little bit of fun for example last week me and my friend went bowling and then we went to the mall it was pretty enjoyable because I forget about everything and focus on myself and the people I am with. I find it interesting the when we were younger we loved being outdoors playing with our friend and now that we are older and have electronics we decide to stay inside because its more entertaining.

Others believe that it instigates procrastination. Inactivity serves a purpose because it keeps us from giving up and it allows us time for new ideas.

Inactivity serves a purpose because it keeps us from giving up. For example, I was once taking a very long test that lasted around 4 to 5 hours. At first, I was just guessing my way through it because I was very tired and ready to give up. Then, we were given a five minute break so I got up and walked around a bit. After walking for a few minutes, I was energized and ready to finish the test. With my new found energy, I was very content with the test and my score. In fact, students who take mental breaks during long testing periods score 31% higher than the ones who did not take any breaks. In conclusion, inactivity keeps us enthusiastic about our work.

Inactivity serves a purpose because it allows us time for new ideas. For example, one of my friends named Generic_Name once did not go to school for three days. During these three days, she organized her school essentials and cleaned up her room. Since she was working on a project before the break, she had time to finish it and she even had another project idea for her science class. She obtained a good grade on both projects. In fact, students who have taken breaks during long tests, like the SOL, say that after their break they had a better understanding of the test. Even the workforce workers are encouraged to take a few days off. It helps the worker get more creative. Even the owner of a business need a vacation. In fact, around 56% of entrepreneurs say that they came up with at least one new idea after a vacation. Inactivity helps prepare our minds for when we are active.

Inactivity serves a purpose. Inactivity keeps us from throwing in the towel. it gives us a mental break; which, creates time for new ideas. Some believe that inactivity encourages laziness. However, it gives us time to rejuvenate our attitude and our mindset. If we take more breaks, to let our mind wonder, we would be more effective in anything it is we are doing.

In addition, many schools think that the students should be young when they think about the career they want, just to make sure that they will not change their minds in the future. So, it is a good idea to commit to a career at a young age.

So if the schools support students to find the perfect career for them, then this disagreeable situation will stop. In many cases, people that had to choose a wrong career have to deal with a unhappy life, because they do not feel well in their jobs. Once again, if students have the school's support, they will be able to find the perfect career for them.

In addition, students will learn about the career and how it works. It might not be noticeable for people the fact that nothing is how it seems, some careers might seem to be easy and be hard, or the opposit, the career might seem to be hard and be really easy. For example, it is easy to judge a lawyer when he do not win a case, but we have no idea how hard the work he did can be. In my 19 years in this world, I learned that nothing is as easy as we want it to be, but if we search information about what we want to do for life, we will be happier, that is a fact. Schools should require an essay in which students can write about what they like and what skills they have.

So, students should know what they want and what they are good in. If students learn about the career they want they will have the opportunity to be great professionals. If the students start learning about the career they want at a young age, then they will have plenty of time to prepare themselves mental and phisically for their future career. Also, students will be able to see if they like the career they choose so they do not regret it in the future.

However, many people believed that setting a goal is a accomplishment. When some people set a goal they usually set an easy goal, so they can accomplish. For example, My sister when she set a goal she usually it so simple that she can accomplish it. But for some people they set their own goal really hard and they can't even accomplish it. After all for those who doesn't like setting a goal would likely accomplish something.

For many people that are accomplishing something they always try really hard. When some people accomplish something they would usually try their best to accomplishg something. For example, my brother accomlish something for trying his best at his final. But many people would not even try their best to accomplish some thing.

Therefor, many people could show what they accomplish. For those who show what they accomplish is that they usually do anything to accomplish sommething.

To achieve your goals and objective is make proud of yourself in this world completely of opportunities. For examples, my sister for her dedication, and to be herself, so right now she is in college. To be herself, she achieve their goals and dreams, and she always saying the truth.

The third things what is important is don't let other people tell you to be different. If always to be yourself, you always be successful in life. Some people say you needs to change because they are jealous or they don't like you. Whose say you needs to change is because they want the bad things for you. In my case, I don't remember very well, but one person say to me that, "" I need to change my personality."" In that same afternoon I go to tell my mom what this person say to me, and what my mom say to me was, "" Don't let any person to over shine the light you had.""

In my conclusion, I feel this is very important for all people need to reflect, in this life the most important things is be yourself don't matter what. The are three things that one person never forget is to be yourself, to achieve goals by yourself, and don't let other people tell you to be different. If you let people do what ever they want with you life, you never be successful in life.",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0
CB34AD33CAEB,"Playing an instrument is fun because it can a hobby for the people who are just starting. For example, A piano is used for many types of music. Such as Smooth jazz, Rock, Orchestra, Rap and much more. Pianos requires a great amount of practice and knowing all the keys to create a good music at a play with the audience amused. Professional piano players gets most people's attention by knowing the right keys for the music that the piano players are playing. In addition, There are many tutorials of how to play the piano and learning the right key on social media to begin or improve your piano skills, due to technology. As a result, Pianos has been used frequently in the 1960's for music and people still listen to it everyday in the radio in their automobile. But sometimes Smooth jazz with a piano in the background is played at a cafe and restaurants to relief the stress that people are having in their personal lives. But there are way more instruments than just the piano.

A saxophone is fun to use and its kind of similar to a piano according to the similarity of what music type the instrument is used on, except for rock, rap, and maybe orchestra. The saxophone is famously known by smooth jazz, jazz, and night jazz and night jazz are commonly used in New York cafes at night and other states. Next, the saxophone is similar to a trumpet, trombone, and tuba by blowing on the top part of the saxophone and at the same time using your both of your hands to make a rhythm. However, an electric piano has more than 20 buttons of instruments to choose from. It has guitar, trumpet, flute, clarinet, and even a saxophone for a different sound for the keys just for the people who want to change their style. In addition, Saxophones can be taught in music class in middle school, high school, or just a music school in general. It takes a couple of years to practice for beginners or couple of months to practice a new music for experts. But if you master a saxophone, thats where the fun part starts. You can create relaxing jazz instrumentals for people to listen to for meditation and stress relieving. And you can also be well known for doing those kinds of stuff. But, there is a last instrument that is really famous and also really fun to use.

There are different types of guitars to choose from dealing with music. The acoustic guitar is one of the most calm sounding guitars in the world because it is used to make sad music and also relaxing. This guitar is fun to use by learning how to know which strings you should use first in order to make a good song or music with a acoustic guitar in the background. Next, the distorted guitar is mostly well known by rock and heavy metal. These guitars need to be plugged on an amplifier for it to work and they are loud. But thats what heavy metal fans like such as Intensity. The clean guitar is mostly used for country music and soft rock. This is another type of guitar that people really like the rhythm and can listen to it nonstop. These three types of guitars are very different and attracts people's taste of music because some people are different.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0
CC8647F0D1E1,"Should the school board add one and a half hours to school each day?

School should not be extended any longer than it already is! Although the school board may think that school should be one hour and a half longer, students and parents believe that school hours should remain the same. I do not agree with the school board planning to add one hour and half every school day. School by its self puts a lot of pressure on the students and with a hour added its going to be much more difficult.

The school board should not add hours to school, since students are already used to the hours they get out of school. With a hour and a half students would probably get to much pressure on dealing with some school material. Students would also get much more school work. They would also get an hour taken away to spend that time with the family. It would also take time for the students to get used to leaving school an hour later! If the school hours remain the same then students would already be used to the hour schedule, and they would also have time to do after school activities!!

Because the school board wants to add an hours more of school, the school board should listen to the parents and not add another hour. It would give students much more stress. Without an hour added, it would give so much relief to alot of parents that wont have to fight for what they believe the school board should do with the time schedule.",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0
CD1D7EC5810C,"It has been asked by one teacher about the benefits of working with a group or working alone. Work is the ability to do something that given by any one it can be a person, a company or at school that we do it by ourselves or with group. One scientist said that, ""one country can developed not by the Prime minister(President) its by working together"". Although some says working alone is more beneficial then working in group because they learn how or accomplish things by themselves or responsible for that work, actually working with group is more beneficial than working alone because we can get more ideas from other person and it is limited by shorten time to complete the work.

Some people says that working alone is more beneficial than working in group because they learn how to accomplish things by themselves. In our world almost all people struggle to accomplish their work by their own, which is good to learn many challenging things in our work. For example, Thomas Edison invented the light bulb with out asking for help, he also fail many times to passing light through in the bulb. Also Leonardo Davinci took him more than a year to draw the most expensive and beautiful woman Monaliza, but he didn't ask anyone to help him. We can do any thing by ourselves if we work hard and struggle not to fail.

Actually Working with group is more beneficial than working alone because more ideas flow out from another person. In Biology our nerve system can stuck when we thing over and get stressed, the last level of stress is stuck. One person can do one or two things but if another person help him they can have more ideas. For instance, the two brothers who made the airplane, now a days we can see what kind of airplane made. However because of they are two they mix their idea and get it done.

Time is short in this world. God gave as the time interval to do in our inter life. Bible says God gave 900 years for Adam, and when the people become a lot the time interval became more less, and now a days the interval for our age(time) is 80 or 90 in average. When I came to my idea, it is limited by shorten time to complete the work when we working with group. Lets give an example for this; the teacher gave an assignment for each student to do research about global warming, he gave 1 month to submit it, but if they had work in a group they can easily do it with in less than a month. In this world we stay for shorten time interval we can work together to accomplish our goal.

although some says working alone is more beneficial then working in group because they learn how or accomplish things by themselves or responsible for that work, actually working with group is more beneficial than working alone because we can get more ideas from other person and it is limited by shorten time to complete the work.

My first reason why i think that community parks or state parks are the best is because everyone can go to them. You and your friends can go and just have a blast. There's so much stuff to do like play sports with other people .You can even meet new people that you don't even know. Because not everyone that is there your gonna know because everyone can go. For example the Generic_City park that place is so fun you can play sports with you family and buy stuff like food,clothes and other stuff.

my second reason is that you can have family time. Family time is so important to me because your family is always going to be there for you and the park is a great place to spent time with them. You can meet up with your family at the park. And also you can have a small little birthday party and just have fun there with your family. If you have little sibling they are going to love it because there's a park and kids love the park and the adults can be talking like your aunt with your mom. And also i fell like being outside with your family is better because you just get to look at the trees and nature instead of being inside.

my last reason is if your stress, i been stress before and i feel like the best places to go are the parks because you just can forget about everything and just draw or write. And if your stress you can do so much things like yoga and after cumming things. The park can also help people in different ways like they can be relaxing .And also if your going throw something i feel like being outside is the best thing because if your inside your only going to get worse. So the park can help in different ways like stress.

In conclusion the reasons why the community parks or the state parks are enjoyable or people might find them enjoyable is because everyone can go to them, family time and If your stress. And you can do more fun stuff not just this. I love to go to the community parks because i get to spent time together with my family and we just have a good time.

CE214B0C2CB6,"The British naturalist and politician John Lubbock once wrote, ""Your character will be what yourself choose to make it

In my opinion, we do choose who we want to be. I agree with John Lubbock because not everyone has the same intentions as the people who surround us, we choose our own path, and people are raised differently.

Not everyone has the same intentions as the people they hang out with. Not because I want to go to college and become a nurse, means that my best friend, that I spend most of the time with, would want to be a nurse or be in a medical field as me. Some people might think differently and say that we are influenced by the people we spend our time with. We choose who we want to become. People have their own dreams and choose their own path.

We choose our own paths. I once got invited to a party where I knew there were going to be lots of teens drinking and doing drugs, so I told my friend, who invited me, that I didnt wanted to go because I new it was bad. For some people it is just fun and dont think about the consequences. Not everyone thinks the same, and people are raised differently.

We were all raised differently. For siblings, I think it is different because they are being raised by the same people and have almost the same points of view, but that does not mean they are or think the same. There could be two sisters being raised the same but one might have different habits or opinions than the other. At the end of the day we choose who we want to be.

We choose who we want to be. Yes, we are influenced by the people we see everyday and we might just take it as inspiration, but we are the ones who work towards our goals and not anyone else. We do choose who we are because not everyone thinks the same, we choose our destiny, and parents raise their children with different habits and knowledge.",3.5,3.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5

First, online education has made it easier for students to study at home without worrying about how they are going to get to school. I'm in favor of the online education because it made it easier for me to take my online classes at home and I can do my assignment any time I want to do it. The online education is also convenient for students in colleges; most of the students in colleges study at home because they don't have to worry about transportation, nor the gas money for their car. My brother is in college and where he lives they get a lot of snow in the winter, so it make it hard for to go to college. Now he does not have to worry about the weather because he can study for his classes online.

Second, most people are now doing online jobs because the grown of technology. In my opinion the most popular online job is to be a you tuber; a lot of you tubers film their lives and put on the internet then the get money of it. One of my friend is a you tuber and he gets decent amount of money just form putting videos of him self on the internet. The way YouTube work is the you tuber up lodes a video on YouTube and if he gets a lot of views then he gets a lot of money. Another online risky job is buying and selling in stocks. One time I bought an online stock form the company Tesla and it was really good price, after three months I sold the stock double the amount that I bought it in the first time. When people buy stocks from other company is like having a percentage of the company that buyer own. The risky part about it is people never now when the stock will go up or down.

Third, online shopping has made it convent for people to order everything online. The most popular online delivery is Amazon; Amazon made people lives so much easier by having everything delivered to their houses. When I order online I always order from Amazon this company has everything I need for me and for my family. Amazon also has fresh grocery that they deliver it for the costumers in the same day that they order it. In these modern days other stores are now delivering online, so people can buy their needs while they are at home.

Although technology has made people lazy and decreased the communication between humans, but it made easier for student to do their homework, it made it easier for people to make money while they are at home, and it made easier for those people who don't like to do grocery shopping in the stores.

In conclusion the growth of technology has helped a lot of people with their lives including student and online workers.

First, at all student can use cell phone for any emergency or use the Google translation because sometimes is take minutes to find out in the dictionary. Also, because in some schools Student can't have access to use computer.

Second, Sometimes teachers put some worksheet or order tints to do in Google classroom and we have to do by using a computer and sometimes computer gate very slow and we can do by use cell phone device is sly.

Third. We know some student use cell phone for bad propose like to no't pay attention in class or make bulling other classmate. But, I think if the Schools use different methods like to block some app for example Snapshot or other student use to bulling.

Having access to a cell phone in class could tempt the student to cheat on their class work or test. Also students could send each other answer through a text.

We have always get something done if the tasks or assignments are done.

Take for example people that work jobs, day and night they tend to get work or tasks or assignments done.

How do they get stuff done, workers usually plan it out like steps to go though to complete them if they dont follow the steps like how are they going to complete the task or assignment to get it done. Workers always need to plan it out before proceeding to the task or assignment to finish or complete. For example Generic_Name wants to figure out how to complete his project, he need to plan step by step and what materials he needs for the project. He follows the step by step plan but realizes what he needs to do later on he gathers the materals and starts to complete his project just by always doing it.

All of us always have to something to complete any tasks or assignments to finish.

It's not going to work if we dont always doing something or plan it out , it's the reason why if you wanna get it stuff done you have always do it in order complete it. For example take school students for a example, they tend to always to get work done so they can free time to themselves and usually making sure the answers they write down are correct to get good grades. School students have determation to complete classwork they're assigned to, so later on they don't have to complete it for homework at home for free time. It's better to always complete work so you don't have to complete later on. For example any job work usually has work to do like car manufactures , they have a assembly to work on because it's where the cars are starting to be made by the workers in the assembly line. They have to work the machines to put the parts on the cars that are being work on so it can shipped of to the car dealership. Everything revolves around on always getting something on time, so it doesn't become a problem later on. Everyone like to job workers to school students alwayss have to something , its why we tend to get stuff done.

Always accomplish it by doing it

Reasons why, we have to do it if we tend to get our task or assignments done then that work doesn't get it the way of what you are trying to on the next task. Accomplishing that we are trying to get to is a good way to start off, you see like CEOs of a company planning what they want done and to figure it how to accomplish it. For example take CEOs they're good at getting stuff done and accomplished it pefectly cause they own businesses and tell his workers what food products or drinks that stores need for people to attract to buy their goods or clothes. People always have to plan to work towards to they want to achieve or accomplish even for their future. it's not going to work if you don't put the effort into the assignment or tasks to make it happpen. You always have to make sure what you want and to make it happen so that your future has more opportuniites.

.Sometimes they don't even change because they don't care about it, and some of the people they get altered on something or on someone, it's based on what experiences people already had .

Some people don't even change when they have their first impression because they don't even care about it and people can change when they really give them a bad impression about them. Sometimes they keep doing the same thing every day and they don't even care about other people who are talking about them. But when they get another impression they start to think on what they did wrong and they analyze it. People start to change when they really need to change who they are. And to change takes time some people don't change quickly because they can commit the same thing without thinking it.

People can get impress on relationship about betraying each other, they can get altered on something or on someone . In a relationship their are always going to have problems it could be jealous, toxic, and bad influence. Many adolescents are dying just because they give them a impression about her/his boyfriend betraying them with another one and they don't even think about how hard is goig to be to that person knowing that they betraying them in that moment. Being on a relationship is not to impress others that they can get jealous at, sometimes changing is hard but it's a good way to have a good relationship.

In my experience, when I had my first impression I think that it was impossible for me to change myself. In that moment when they told me that I was a girl who disappointed other people about my attitude, I really feel very disappointed in me that I think negative everyday. And that I can not do what other people are good at. It was impossible for me to change my attitude because I was use to things that it was good for me but for others was not. So one day I say that I was going to change who I'm no matter how hard it was but it was going to be possible for me to change with or without help.

I believe that when people have their first impression on something they can change. changing is a good way to show to everyone that you are not the same person you use to be, and that every impression that they going to give you is going to be a way to try and to not commit the same thing in the future. People can say that it's impossible to forgot what we did in the past but when we try every day to forget it, we can get better to it. Everyone are not perfect but we can get better at changing our attitude on not trusting people who we think that it's not the kind of people were are going to trust.

The internet is a good source to use because it has a lot of information and different things. For example I did a project for history and I used the internet to do it. My topic was about Anna Frank and her dad and what she went though as a little girl at a young age and how she died and why it was remembered and why we still talk about It. This project was all online and we had to use special website to use for the project. All my articles were online and i've learn more about the holocaust it was and about what happened to Anna Frank. I read a lot of articles and books of her.

D09D2C17FB38,"Does your teenager have a curfew? Do you think they should have a curfew? Keeping teenagers safe is really important especially when it's dark out. Thing out in the world are not like they used to be. A city council is debating on a curfew adoption. If this curfew is adopted does this mean teens on the street after hours are breaking the law? Will curfews keep teens out of trouble or unfairly interfere with their lives?

A city council is debating on an adoption of curfew for teens. Why are they debating about this adoption? The first reason is city council does not want teens getting hurt or putting themselves at risk at a young age. Second, they want to keep teenagers safe from the bad things out in the world. Lastly is they do not want trouble, some teens make bad choices about drinking and other stuff they should not do at a young age. That is why city council is debating a curfew adoption.

If the curfew adoption is adopted by city council, does it mean that teens on the street after hours are breaking the law? Many people have different opinions. I also think it depends on why they are out. I would say they are not breaking any law if its for work or any emergency. They are also not breaking the law if they are with an adult because it is not like they are on their on there own. However if they are out to be hanging out with friends and partying stuff like that, yes the would be breaking the law. Does this mean if teens are out they are breaking the law? In some ways yes and in some ways no, it depends on why they are out pass the curfew.

Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble or unfairly interfere in young lives? First things first most teens would say that by having the curfew law its interfering with there lives. Teens would say that because they want to go out and have funny and other stuff. having the curfew law will keep teens safe and out of trouble because you never know what could happen. Another reason i would say keeps them out of trouble is because most teens like to leave the house at night with out their parents knowing. That is never something you should do. Teens should think, Is it worth the risk? A lot of things can happen even though you may think everything is okay and that nothing will happen, but that is what you think there might be a chance you could be wrong. Now teens should think, Do curfews keep them safe or does it interfere win there lives?

The city council's debate about the adoption of curfew for teenagers. Many believe it should be a law and others believe its should not be a law. They debate upon this law because they want to keep teens safe and do not want them to get hurt or in trouble at a young age. Will it mean that any teen on the streets after curfew is breaking the law? It Will probably depend on why they are out for example for work or for and emergency and unless they are with an adult. Some reasons other than that like to go to parties or hang with friends, is most likely breaking the law. Will this law keep teens out of trouble or interfere with there lives? Most teens opinions would be that this law is interfering with their lives. Some teens most likely parents will say it's to keep teens safe instead of risking themselves.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0
D0C50EB5CB1F,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow,"" I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, because he says that if you don't do something you will stay in the same place and never grow up if life, you will not advance, and you conformed with what you have. I believe that peoples always try to overcome in life, that's why you always have to try progress in life and grow up and not be an conformist. because you always can be better in life. We have the ability and the opportunity in our hand.

First , never stay where you are, always try to do something else and try to get more experience, always try to overcome in life,because you can always try to be bigger, and bigger,and try to dominate other things because you have the ability and the opportunity do grow up and never give up easily and if you have the opportunity to grow you will do it because never let opportunity get away from you chase the opportunity to be better and to master other things.

I believe that you always have the ability to chase your dream and if it is not enough you can find more and you can get to your where your limit is. I think that all people have the potential to follow and surpass them abilities and if you already dominated your, you can find and try another one don't stay with the same one because there are always there's a lot of things inside of us that we don't want to take it out of them but if a person take it out he can do things that non one can believed, because it still inside of them you know that you have capacity for that but you don't want to do it.

all people make them own decision but some of them don't know what's them capacity is. Sometimes they don't take the opportunity they just throw it on the trash.

Like the feeling of a person they don't fight fort that they can be a big house a lot of money but they can't feel the love that someone has for them that's the one that a person has to recognize they stay in the same place without doing anything they know that they can change that make that happen. But they can change in like and they can grow up.

As a person we have to respect each other, make decision on life to grow as a person be a good person in the association take care of my and my family respect my family, be respectful with everyone. Be clean be a good person help someone make a man as a person having good attitude be as good person with my mom. If we make be thinking in this life we ave not gonna grow as a person if we are doing something that we are not suppose to. I think

I think that respect is one of the most important part in the world.

conclusion

In conclusion I think that all people can always finds more opportunity and they can get more experience by doings new things and overcome a new person in life, and chase dream because if they chase that dream they can make it happen for real. I think that all people in this world has the capacity to do things in life but some of them don't want to do it because they just can't, and they stay there without doing nothing, they should chase that dream and never let it go.",2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0
D10BBD82D66F,"Former Primer Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", and in my opinion I agree with Churchill's words. Failure has a enormous role in success. Failure is all about, learning from the mistakes you made and gaine all the experience you can out of it, Not giving up and plan what can you do better to accomplish what you have been fighting for to get even better results that the ones you were expecting in the first place, that is what failure is all about and that is why it has big and important a role in the pursuit of success.

Learning from the mistakes that were done is a big example of the role that failure has on the pursuit of success; throughout history there had been many times were our society, nation, and specie had learned from their mistakes; as an example of this is the League of Nations, it was created after WWI to maintain worldwide peace; It end up being a big failure. we learned from this and the U.N was created to maintain global peace through nations and till present days it stills been one of societies biggest success. this is an example of how learning from mistakes you have made in the past is useful but overall this is one of many examples you can put to show how failure is related to success.

Not giving up is also really important on this because giving up is not an answer as an example of this is, Pele, he became one of the best soccer players in history but it also became the youngest player to win a world cup, since a really small age he was told that he was never going to become a soccer player, he was told numerous time that his talent was not enough, but he did not gave up, he gave all he had and when he had the chance he showed everyone of what he was capable of and became one of the best players in the world. In his debut on first world cup he suffered an injury on his knee while training for the first match, it let him out for half of the of world cup. Doctors told him that he had to do exercise every day to get better, but that he was not going to be able to play in the whole tournament; he did not give up he trained day after day and in the third phase of the world cup he was given an opportunity to play in one of the games. This is a great example of the strength that people have when they do not give up and they give all they are capable of. This is also a great example that shows how failure has many things directly related at helping people to success at what they are trying to achieve.

Another example of how failure can help you success is trying once more. this is the most important feature in the relationship of failure and success because once you have looked back at what you did wrong last time and learning from that, you are ready to try once more and accomplish what you have been fighting for. As an example of this is the spaceships that have send to space to reach many places in the universe. Its well known that many of the spaceships that have been send to space failed, and in really big proportions. Many of those spaceships exploded do to problems on their systems or other problems. After many tries looking at what failed and what went wrong humans were able to send satellites and people to the outer space, it took many failures to till we got all of this finished, now we are able to send spaceships throughout the galaxy to explore the stars and many other places. failure taught us what were we doing wrong, and we learned from it, this shows us of how failure is related to success by trying many times to achieve what you are fighting to achieve.

Many people believe that failure is not related in any way to success, they have arguments saying that, you can accomplish something at the first try, that you do not learn anything from the mistake or the times you have failed at something, and they also say that you lose all enthusiasm when you fail numerous times at something. I believe this people are wrong because you do not always accomplish something in the first try, and you always learn from your mistakes, you might learn valuable lessons out of them; their last argument can be denied by telling to yourself that you can do it, we decide when do we lose our enthusiasm or not. this is why I believe they are wrong failure is related in the pursuit of success even if we want it or not because you learn and gain experience out of it, that is what makes this world a better place, failure, and it might sound like is not true but I believe it is; failure is always there and we can always learn valuable lessons out of it.

Like I stated in my examples above failure is related to success; failure is not a bad thing because we learn from the mistakes we have done, we can gain experience out of it, we learn what are we doing wrong, but what we have to keep in mind is that we decide if we lose the enthusiasm in something whenever we decide to do it, this is why I believe that the words that Winston Churchill said are true, because from failure to failure we learn from the mistakes we made along the way to success, we can think of a better plan with the things we learned and after that we can try once more to accomplish the thing we have failed with better results that those we were expecting. That is why I think that failure is related to success. ",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0
D1A0AFC80A9A,"Ever since, we were kids we started choosing our own character traits. it can be good or bad based of the environment we live in, how we were raised, and personal experiences. But we can always change our character traits, it's similar to an opinion on something or someone. We choose who influence us. we decide if we want to be happy or sad,making good and bad decisions all those are character traits that we choose with our minds.

Lets say you are inspired by Kobe Bryant. You look up to him as an idol because, of what he accomplished in his lifetime. You either wanna be like Kobe or be better than him. That right there is a character trait, the ability to choose who influences us by what they have accomplished. Some people believe we can't choose our character traits because we did not decide nor choose the way we wanted to be born, we did not choose if we wanted to be tall, short, black, white etc.. But, they miss the fact that character trait is not about the things we can't change, its about the things we can change and decide for ourselves to become a better person or be like someone who influenced us.

Choosing character traits is not an easy task for everyone. In fact, adults have a hard time choosing character traits. Unlike,most kids that dont care about the consequences nor judgments, kids usually choose careless traits but as they get older and become adults, they realized their mistakes and they choose traits with precautions. Mainly because adults have a lot of things to worry and take care of, their character traits can cost them to miss out on big opportunities like a job or a promotion. Something we all have in common is character traits, without it our lives would be meaningless we would not achieve nothing big or anything to be proud of. Our lives are based off the character traits that we choose.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

P.e is my favorite educational activity because i mostly enjoy it. Because all my friends are in that class. The most thing i do in that class is play basketball which i am trash at it but i still play with the boys and i enjoy the time .Another thing i like to do is soccer because its playful and playing with friends is more better. Because it helps you with teamwork,speed and skill.

Soccer is my favorite sport because when I was little I would always see all the games. And i would enjoy it because soccer is my family favorite thing to do when we are bored and its nice outside we would play like two hours and before we play soccer we would have steak and enjoy the temperature. And after the steak we would play soccer with my uncle and some of my dad's friends and we would play soccer until we would get very tired.

So back to p. e some people think that p. e is boring but i think that it is fun because thats when most of the time i play with my friends and i would enjoy it mostly because thats like the only time we would be free a and out of school work and play with my friends. But the other thing is that when we are at p. e people don't like it because some of them are tired and some of them are just bored at p. e i don't really get it but they just think that it is so boring or their tired of doing anything.

P.e and soccer are technaclily the same thing because they could run around and they could enjoy their time with some friends but like i tell you that there's people that doesn't like doing p. e. So i don't know what people say about it but i enjoy p. e because its enjoyable to do it to not the test but the activity's they have.

And soccer to they have lots of training to do but the rule is to have fun and play nice for you can enjoy the people and the coach. so if you or any one else is bored than try doing soccer for you can not be that bored anymore so just be playful a and play right for you can not be that bored at anything anymore so just try it one day and i highly recommend you that you will like playing soccer

But like i tell you if you are that lazy that you can't even do anything then you have to try one thing. Because you have to try something because you can't live a life that you can't even do anything you have to at least try to do something in your life so yeah thats all i have to tell you so play something right not bad.

Just imagine doing something you love that makes you exited and it just feels like you have never worked a day in your life, my three major reasons are improve, have the mindset, and play professional soccer.

First, one of my biggest reason is to improve. I want to improve by practicing everyday. Similarly, asking for help from a coach or someone better than I am. Specifically, if I make a mistake I can learn from what I did wrong, so I can do a better job at it next time. On the other hand I could play for a team and

I could practice with people better or not. Moreover, if I could play for a team I could play in games compete in tournaments and learn from other people.

Next, this one is huge having the mindset. The mindset of playing professional. playing with no fear, playing the game that is like a life time. Specifically, believing that you can do it I can make it to professional. Therefore, having the mindset for my future because I know as I go there will be more challenges for me to face. Finally having a good mindset is very important.

Furthermore, what I have wanted my entire life, my entire life I have wanted to play professional soccer because I have practiced my entire life for it. Another reason, it is just what I love to do. However, it could be rough sometime, and you could get hurt. It is a great way to get to meat new people. Moreover, it is like you just started a new life. Lastly, you get payed really will that is one of the biggest reason why plethora of people want to play professional.

D2910C3C8E3B,"I agreed with Auther Ralph Waldo Emerson "" Unless you try to do somthing beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" which is ture. Hard working pays you back!

Some people think they become rich by nature, every time knowledge need to upgrade ,and to keep our wealthy life need to work hard.

First reason, most of the time people think they become rich by nature. Which means they become well to do when they born. I personally do not support this idea because behind every success they is a hard working. For example United State of America is number one powerfull country in the world but, before America got that name their was a lots of scrifice. In my opinion If we dig the ground and we found the piece of gold that is not wealth that is a sign of destination, that means until we got the gold reservoir do not stop excavate.

Second reason, when a year change lots of thing change. For instant knowledge. Now adays tecnology descover the world. In this case every time knowledge need to upgrade. If you have degree in the filed of IT in 2016 and, still you did not upgrade your knowledge you are out of the game. The system or the caricullem is change so fast so we need to ajest our speed to run with the generation. If we need to grow what we have, we need to try somthong.

Inaddition, to keep our wealthy life we need to work hard. For example Bill Gate is wealthy man in America he have everything house,car and money. Bill gate does not say I have everything I do not need to work after this time. He is working hard like us. Because unless he did something to grow his wealth he will going to lose what he have. This is real life by any means if we stop trying we lose everything work, food, money, and family. The key is work hard do not Give Up.

In conclusion, we need to do somthing or try our best to live our wonderfull life. I strongly support Author Ralph Waldo idea. Dreams are not somthing to wait for; they are somthing to work for.

Which means works are the rode to get our dreams. Today is a great day to learn somthing new.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0
D30614F0911F,"Some schools are considering the idea to offer distance learning for students to attend classes from home. Many students can benefit by considering this new idea for students to take classes from home by the way of online or videos. Although, many other students would not be agree with this idea.

In my opinion, I am not agree with the idea for students to attend classes from home. First, if the students are in their houses they would have more distraction, for example; they can get distracted by the food, many time food is a big distraction for students to concentrate in classes. They can also get distract because of the television, they can see something interesting in the TV and they would quickly get distracted. Also one of the biggest distraction for everyone is the cellphone. If a student is taking classes at home; no one would be responsible to tell him/she not to use their cellphones. Second, they would not take it seriously. They would feel free because they are in their houses. Sometimes they might take the classes; and sometimes they would not take them because no one would be telling them to do it. They would feel allow to do whatever they want because they would not have the rules like in a classroom. If the student is in a classroom; he/she receive more information, more examples, more attention, and more help. Every teacher has rules in their classrooms; rules that help students to be successful. And third

They would not be able to learn as much as they would in a classroom. They would not be able to ask questions and get the answer they would need. They would not receive as much attention as they need.

However, many students support the idea for students to attend classes from home. It can be considered a good idea for many students; because they would not be traveling from one place to another; it would safe them time. Also many times when there is a bad weather outside; many schools cancel classes; because they can't travel. And by considering this idea for students for students to attend classes from home would help them; because even if is raining or snowing, they will not cancel their classes. Therefore, many students agree with this idea because is not only going to safe them time; it would also help many students. Many students do not have transport. Sometime they have to walk or even pay so that they can go to school and attend to class. using the online program would give them a big support.

In conclusion, considering the idea for students to attend classes from home by the way of online or video can be a good or a bad idea for many students. I do not support this idea. Students should not attend to classes online or video. Students can get distracted easily by anything or anyone in their house. Many time studying at home give students many issues; there can be many people at home and too much noise that the student would not be able to concentrated and will get distracted. It can also happen that watching a video and that there's no one there to explain it; can make the students tire and he/she can fall sleep. Also, students will not take it seriously because there's not a teacher telling them and explaining them what to do. They would not receive as much education, information, and attention as they need. My position on this issue is to maintain the students attending to school. The students will learn more if they receive classes in school. Attend classes in a classroom with a teacher will provide students more support and it would help them in many ways to be successful in the future.      ",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5
D325C8F858F6,"A group of students have skill to take decisions, there're a lot way to do, students can react to any problem, but work alone can be good as a group, people who like work alone have abilities: reasoning, recognize, and expression. Groups were created to share ideas. Therefore, it's not bad get help from other people, everyone say, "" two head think better than one.""

Groups make different way to share or send a message, a few people can create a lot, base in their share of thoughts, abilities, and decisions. Groups have the most of attention in this case. Elsewhere, work alone is base in just you, and what you know, if something that you did it, come to be wrong, you will not share it. If people who like work by their self can't support ideas with reasoning, can't do a perfect project. the change of ideas always will be a good work and the can support your reasons, why you had make it.

Work in group include: less work, time, and money, back to work alone you have your own words, spend a lot of your time more than you think, also could take too much time to finish. To different of groups students can do other activities. The group help to students to learn and combine new thought from other students. Friends can help to get a correct answer or do a good work.

The important of groups is that students learn to share, help, and be kind with other students make a friend, besides that learn, help, and teach to other, they make fun their work. work alone give stress and that show someone who want to make everything by his\herself they share their own ideas. Sometimes work alone can be a good choice, because is you're wrong, you can't blame to nobody.

In conclusion, I believe that groups are more helpful for students, because they learn to take other decision and compare. About work alone, I'm not agree, because you try to do something, maybe that's good, but you're not count with other ideas, expressions, or declaration of other thought. In my opinion is more beneficial working in groups that show us compare, analyze, and be friendly with others.",2.5,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.5

The philosopher, physician, and humanitarian Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" I am agree with this statement because there is not better way to influence others than have a good example by our owm behavior. The change start in us to show a good example of habitat, religion, responsability, respect to others, and over all humility.

The first reason is that nowadays the people see and judge of how peple look like, how people are dressed, or if people are old or young, in that way they are giving examples to others to judge the people, instead of give a good impression or example to other that everyone needs to love each other like they love their selves, no matter how they are. Respect other to get respect, always kind with everyone no matter who they are. Helping each other everywhere. Be a good citizenship: Payin your bills, respecting the laws, and be a good neighborhood. Because without examples, no one can make differences.

The second reason: Be a kind person, study to have a good future. For example: ""I am in High School I am graduate this year. I am a English learner. When I came here in US I did't know how to speak English, but I came to school, I study hard all the words, and I practiced my English. Now I know the languaje, not at all but I can defend my self. I want to encorage all hispanic people to learn English or let their child to go to school, and I know that is not easy but not impossible. I hope to give a good example for all hispanics. I will keep doing it to influence them to learn the language of this country.""

Some people say that there are many ways to influence others like with words and not with actions. However, they are wrong because how people will change without an example of life, like Martin Luther King, he was a great person, and he passed through a lot of things, and everybody knows that he influenced a lot of people in that time and I think that he still influencing more people even that he is not with us anymore.

In conclusion, giving example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others. encoraging them to learn english, helping each other, loving other no matter their religion. Influencing lifes with actions is better than jsut words. What would happen if no one wants to be an example for other.    ",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,2.5,3.0

Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Some people don't like to be always doing something; however, do we accomplish more if we are always doing something. We can accomplish more if we are always doing something because we don't get bored, we can have a good and healthy life and we can achieve what we propose.

Firts, we don't get bored. For example, if we are in our home and we are doing something like cleaning the house, or cooking we don't get bored easily because we know how to spend our time. Another example, when we are doing nothing during the day, the day feel so long, but if we are doing something during the day, the day feel faster. Also, when we do something different each day we don't get bored because we don't repeat the same routine each day. In sum, focus on do always something is good to not stay bored.

Next, we can have a good and healthy life. I think, if we are feeling sad, or we are having negative thoughts we can start to do always something to distract our minds and feel much better. Addionally, when we are always doing something like activities we can have a healthy life because we can spend our time doing excersises in home or going to they gym. Also, if we don't do any activities and we just spend our time watching movies or staying in bed, we can get sick because our bodys are not in movement, but if we are always doing something we don't get sick because we are having our body in movement and doing good activities. To conclude, It is important to do always something to have a good and healthy life.

Finally, we can achieve what we propose. For example, if we are in high shool and we want to graduate, we have to do always something like go to school everyday, do our homeworks and pay attention to have the opportunity to graduate. Also, when we wat to get a job we need to do always something and go to find a new job to have our own money and be responsible. Also, if we are always doing something we are gona fight for what we want and we are gonna be better persons. To summarize, we have to focus and do always something and achieve our goals.

In conclusion, we can accomplish more if we are always doing something because we don't get bored, we can have a good and healthy life and we can achieve what we propose. For example, We can can do activities everyday to not get bored, we can have our bodys in movement to have a healthy life and we can have good opportunities and fight for what we want.

D43F13CE2638,"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something?, Or does inactivity also serve a purpose?. This question is fairly easy because if you just simply do nothing, Then nothing would be accomplished, Unless you believe in ""when the times right etc."" but sitting around doesnt make you more successful, For example if you wanted to be very successful you have to work with it. Like staying after school to study for the SOL

the very next day, Or remembering to do all your chores before your parents came back from work. But on the other hand doing nothing can also accomplish many things. For example if you were to be in a car accident and broke several bones then obviously you'll be in a wheel chair for several months and You wont be able to move at all. And doing so will help you accomplish healing, Your doing nothing but still getting better at the same time. Have you herd of the saying ""All good things happen to those who wait"" this means it could be a normal day then suddenly something really good comes to you like either you find a job or the love of your life and have a happy ending. There are other ways too, for example theirs a saying ""dont mess with something that doesnt need to be messed with"" and ""Theres light at the end of the tunnel"" these quotes connect in a way because sometimes some things should be left alone and over time something good will come to it, like you able to accomplish your goals.

Or maybe your the type of person to let Fiat decide, so you let things happen naturally. Overall you can accomplish many tasks for both doing and not doing anything, But in my opinion you can accomplish more when your doing more because your working for whatever it is your aiming for. Also the quote from Thomas Jefferson ""Determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" This quote in a nut shell is my response to this question. I'd rather be busy and know that i'm accomplishing what i want than to wait until something happens.",3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5
D537BE6997F7,"I agree with success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because everyone need to be stronger, successful, and become independent youself.

Success are things that everybody need to be stronger the most they can with every single thing in your life because everyone has bad moments in lifes and there are many peoples that they want to see them fail in everything. For example, if someone is given in they can find someone who is bad person and the only thing that they do is to given words that did not help in anything, but that's why they have to failure, but do not have to loss enthusiasm because if you loss enthusiasm you are failed in everything because in lifes you can find peoples that want to help you a lot, but sometimes you are going to find good peoples that want to help you in everything. Therefore, it does not matter what other peoples want to tell you people just have to continue their lifes and do not have to give up in anything, it does not matter peoples have to do everything they can because if you propose what you want you can do it no one is going to said no.

Success is that everyone has to be successful in lifes because everybody has to be esthusiasm in everything. You do not have to loss that because you have to be with good smile because it does not matter what is happened in your life you must have to had a good smile in everything because it does not matter how many times in your lifes you are falling you have to continue because if you do not do a good job, thinking that you can not do what you want, or said that you are going give up in everything. For example, if your sister said that some people said that she can not make her dream true you can talk with her with enthusiasm and said that she can do everything she can propose because she do not have to listen those peoples that can not want their lifes good they failature is her past that means that others peoples are going to do the same thing because in this lifes exist peoples that want the bad thing to you that ever can exist.

Success something in life is more harder than you think because you have to pass a lot of thing in your life and you have to stay strong the more you can because if one day you are going to fail in something and there is no one to give you support and you can not anymore, but you have to said in your mind that it does not matter because you are thinking in your mind that you are never give up with anything because you have your mind with power, esthusiasm, and stronger. However, you do not have to be thinking bad things there are some times that you failure with many things that can be in the school, work, or test. You always have to be in mind that it does not matter how many times you took your test and get bad grades you have to do it until you get good grade or how many days you are going to take to learn any kind of food the thing is the you have to be a good person to show to other peoples that you can do whatever you want to show to the world that you can do everything you want because they are here to fail, but if you lose a lot of time you are going to wake up twice.

Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because in this world everyone is here to be something in their life to be someone stronger to make your skills stronger to show to the peoples that you want to be someone with energy to show that there are so many things that you want to do be a successful person to help peoples when they need something; it does not matter what you are passing or what your life is give you. You just have to learn how to be a good person, how you can make your skills stronger, and how you can demostrated to yourself what you can do and can not do because that is a harder to know yourself to see what you can do or not because you can see more peoples that if they can not do anything they do not tried anymore they are sad, mad, or angry with their self because they can not do what they wanted. For example, if your friend want to be in the future a teacher and he/she has to learn, to be prepared, and study. He may not want all of that or he/she may have travel with all of those things he/she is going to get mad with herself, sad with herself, angry with herself and he/she is going to said no i can not with all of this is so harder that i think, but everyone has to be stronger show that you do not have to get mad to show with enthusiasm that does not matter how many times you may fail you have to learn, study, be prepared everything you need and you will see that you can everything you want.

In conclusion, Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because you have to be stronger, successful, and become independent yourself because you have to be stronger with any problem in your life, stronger with every person, and stronger with whatever you have to do. You have to be successful with yourself, with your work, and with your own things. You have to be independent with yourself because when you are older or you are lonely you have to see for your owns things, you have to fight for you owns problems, and for your owns bussiness. For example, if you are going to be a good police you have to see what is coming what your enthusiasm is going to be what you have to be. You have to fail many things, but you have to tried the most you can because is this life everything you do have to be with enthusiasm. Therefore, If you find a job and you boss said that you have to go to do a fish and you went, but you did it wrong and he said this is wrong you failure you have to tried again you have to go with enthusiasm not be angry or sad because you are going to do that with enthusiasm to said im going to do this rigth not wrong because everything you do with enthusiasm everything you will get more better and you will be happy because if you do everything good you are going to feel thatyou do a esthusiasm and good work.",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.5
D57EBE64C7A2,"I am agree with students to use their cell phone in the classroom because some students came to the United State with not knowing any words in English, and even of a student that born in the United State or their native language is English can get to forget the meaning of a word in English. For instance, cellphones or another type of device.

And it can drive you to many type of option which is very good! if you are not clear in the first option you can jump to the second option or third option if needed.

Some students came to the United State without speaking English which mean is so bad, and they don't know how to communicate with teachers so they are likely to uses their cellphone for translating words. I was one of the student that came to United State without speaking any English, and teachers can't speak Spanish too, so I was able to use my phone for translate words to my language, it was helping a lot to communicate with other students that only speaks English. In another reason, I daily uses my phone because it is easy to carrying It in the hallway instead of a big dictionary, and some dictionary does not contain the word that you looking for . Beyond of that, in the cellphone you just need to download the dictionary app or go the Google web and type easily the word that you need to fine information for.

Therefore, cellphones can give many way to you how to understand the word specially the Google web site it can give you pictures, or it can led you to a video link where you can see resources that are explaining the meaning of the word or different manner that they can be clear at the point. I use Google a lot of time because has everything that the dictionary can not be included for example, Google translate can tell you the pronunciation, quickly to research, and even if it is bad it will tell you the meaning besides that if you don't know how to spell the word it contains an option where you can talk to the cellphone which is a lovely option to use.

However, cellphones is a almighty thing to be used in the classroom to help students knowledge or everywhere. beside, been smart and having powerful resource we can learn from cellphones to do many things as some teachers want us to use our cellphones for Wikipedia, kahhot , dictionary web, and googlecassroom for reading , writing or gave us homework throw it.

As we can know already cellphone is very useful for this options too. calling ,sending message, receiving message , set remainder, multiple resource, ects.

Despite of each year is advancing many students at the among of age 12 or 15 years old have a phone or a tablet device which is fine to have. Then, If needed teachers can work in an online website to gave them homework to do at home or working in classroom. And some point, approximate all people have their cellphones in their bag, and easy to care and some people have said that the cellphones is like their friend.

finally, which I did understand that cellphones is necessary needed to use in the classroom which is helping to translate word in another language and cellphones can give you many certain information, idea how to be specific in the word that you are looking for. And also, it can have a different variety of information and some teachers will ask for it during the class, if you have one .

D594B486E6B5,"People that have their faces in front of a screen with there back slouching with the help of technology. Technology is advancing year by year and month by month. When teens or adults get there hands on the new technology they will spend weeks or even months in their rooms, trying to figure out what the device can and cannot do. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on peoples lives, because it can lead to bad communication skills, health problems and being inactive.

However, not everyone agrees with this statement. Some people claim that technology has a positive effect on peoples lives. Neverless, this position overlooks an important point, mainly that technology cannot change how much human contact you have or do not have. For example, my friend she cannot drive, but she can have items get delivered to her; books, food, and clothes. Furthermore, when the delivery person came she did not know the proper way to greet him. Do to technology, people can have bad communication skills and they don't know how to communicate with people when they are in contact with someone.

Moreover, by being isolated, technology can lead to bad communication skills. When someone gets the newest device or game, they want to know how it works. By learning what the device or video game can and cannot do, they usually spend a month learning how the device works or how to unlock the next level in the game. For instance, my brother got a new video game, he has isolated himself in his room, so he can beat the level and go on to the next. When he was finish with the level, he had a hard time communicating properly. Before he played his video game, his grammar was good; now it wasn't. For example he would use the wrong past and present tense. Thus, by staring at the screen for so long, he has got very inactive.

Additionally, sitting on the couch or in a chair with a screen in front of you, every day for a whole month can make a person inactive. People that are inactive can become very lazy, and they intend on making a lot of mistakes when they are talking. They can also gain weight or have health problems. To illustrate, sitting in front of a screen while eating junk food can cause you to gain weight and can lead to health issues. During spring break, my friend had nothing to do, he was on his laptop everyday eating junk food.

Now he has to be careful on what he can and cannot eat, because he will get heart burn.

If he does not stop eating unhealthy foods in front of a screen he will gain more weight and have more health issues.

He does not know how to ask for help; he needs someone to push him to go outside and enjoy the weather, instead of being in front of a screen all day long.

Based on this argument, one must conclude that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on peoples lives. Technology can effect us in many different ways; bad communication skills, health problems and being inactive. In conclusion, technology can change human contact in a negative way.",4.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0

D7766B98F761,"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. I believe that attitude is everything in life. Having a negative attitude can be helpful when someone is defending themselves for what they believe in, but having a positive attitude might change someone's life and at the end of the day you feel good about yourself.

It's important to have a positive attitude in everyday life because your reputation goes up, others want what you have and you set a positive mindset for yourself.

First, having a positive attitude in your daily life will raise your reputation. For example, you are at a job interview, you dress very properly for this job interview. When you first walk in the room, you greet the interviewer with a smile and a handshake, and you start to introduce yourself. That gives the perfect first impression to getting the first place in this job. People in my life have taught me that giving positive attitude around my peers is very important, because having a positive attitude can change what someone think of you. In summary, being positive in a job interview will get you that job that you've been working for your whole life.

Second, people around you want what you have when you show positive attitude. For example, you are doing a group project, you don't know any of the people you are working with. The first thing that you did was to introduce yourself with a big smile, and then you ask for their names. All those people in your group sees that enthusiasm, and they think "" Man! She must be a really nice peson, I wish I have that kind of positivity in my life."" Someone in that group might not been having a good day that day and they saw how positive you are and they want that same positivity that you have.

In summary, a person giving another person positive attitude can help others to be the best that they can be in life.

Third, having a positive attitude can set your mind on positive things in life. For exmaple, in 1999 there was a shooting in Generic_School, 200 people died and 500 people were injured. It was a very sad event for both families and friends. A girl name Generic_Name was injured badly that she has to be in a hospital. But what she said in the hospital that caught everyone's attention was that "" I may be hurting very badly right now and I may or may not be able to walk, but I am glad that I am still alive, and that i get to see my friends and family's faces right now"". Generic_Name was injured so bad that she couldn't even walk, but she had that positive mindset that at least she's not dead. In summary, positive attitude will switch your life around in life's hardest moments.

In Conclusion, positive attitude is the key to happiness and success in life. One person being positive about something, the others follow. That's what so special about positivity, it spreads everywhere you go, as long as you are positive. This changes people's lives every single day.

When someone have positive attitude, your reputation goes up, people want that positivity and you have a positive mindset in everything you do. ",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

D7817C171926,"Benefits of long summer break

Most students enjoy summer vacation and like to have a fun time. Some students may have more time to share with their family. However some students uses that time to have a job and earn money for any emergency or for keep saving for their scholarships, if they have planned go to the college. I believed that students should have a regular summer break because some students have the ability to remember everything they learned before summer break, and also students may enjoy the weather and have some fun time.

First reason that students should have a regular summer break is that students may be able to develop their strength, while they are enjoying their summer break. For instance some students may have summer school where they could make some extra school's work and keep everything they learned in mind. for instance my family just have time in summer, so I would like to try to do some extra help in summer school, and then enjoy the rest of the summer time with friends and family. also there are a few reason that why students may have a regular summer break. Continuosly I will explain some more reason.

Second reason that students should have a regular summer break is that students may be able to enjoy their break going to the pool, to camp, the river, the beach etc. however students may have also time to study on any subject that they want and have a fun time. Students may have a time for themself, for instance they may sleep and wake up at any time they want, hence they have to clean up their house and give to their family some help.

Also students may study at home with their sibling in case they have, and do some activities to remember everything they learned.

Third reason is that some educators feel that the summer break is too long and because that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. but if educators really knows their students, they may be agree with the regular summer break because that the only time that with have with a good weather to enjoy outside of the house. what about if students have a long winter break, they will not be able to go outside because the snow or for the lowest temperature. what about if students have spring and fall off, also that time of the year is still cold not a lot of snow but cold, students may get sickness or something else. In addition if students need to work because, they do not have the resort or the benefits as another students, they have to work but in winter time in some place of job are not hiring so the could not work in winter break.

In the final analysis some people would argue that students should have three-four week break in summer, a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall. however, the summer break is the best time of the year, because students may do something else as play any sports they want, and enjoy that time. Students may have the ability to retain information even after summer break. addionality students would like the advance that they have of having a long summer break and be prepared for the next school's year.

D7C9E22CC216,"Graduating Early is a Bad Idea

Personally I think graduating in three years instead of the traditional four years should not be allowed. School should really think about this idea before making it an actual thing, because for some students this could be a good thing, but for some students this could be really bad.

Graduating early to me is a bad idea because, I dont think it gives students the right amount of time to learn everything they need to learn while being in high school. In high school students go through situations, make mistakes and bad decisions, learn how to fix those things and not do them again. Students find what they really like to do in life while being in high school but some students need a lot of time to find out what is that thing that they love and want to do for the rest of their lives. Students that play sports need to play for a good amount of time to get better at it and maybe get an scholarship, students that take mechanic courses or photography courses need a good amount of time to learn about everything they need to dominate on whatever they do, so that way colleges can come to their school, watch them and find out if they deserve a scholarship or not. While being in high school, students learn how to adapt to new environments, new people and even different languages so that way when they go to college they are ready for anything. Students that do want to follow this plan and graduate a year early, are going to have to go to school during the summers or in the evinings, if students do that then they won't be able to get a job and work what being in hish school and they won't be able to learn to manage their money and to figure out what's good or bad for them economically.

I have a friend her name is Generic_Name, she graduated a year early because she took online classes and stayed after school to graduate a year early. Generic_Name goes to college and has trouble adapting to the new environment and dealing with defferent types of people, Generic_Name is having emotional pronlems because she is not sure anymore about what she wants to do in life. Generic_Name and I talk everyday and she tells me about everything she goes through, she tells me she can't get a boyfriend because she doesn't know how to maintain a healthy relationship, she tells me she's having economical problems because she's doesn't know how to manage her money because while being in high school she worried more about getting her credits than actually learning what she had to learn to be ready to the real world.

In conclusion I think is a bad idea for schools to allow students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years of high school. Give students the right amount of time to learn everything they need to be ready for the real world.             ",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5
D80B98C274D4,"Extending each school day

I totally disagree with extending each school day, because kids wouldn't have enough time do other activities, kids need a distracion away from school, they need to put their minds in something other than just school. Kids, parents, and teacher have other things to do, they all have plans and will get in the way of that.

One of the reasons why i disagree with extanding the school day is that kids will not have enough time to do other activities, for example after school programs, clubs, and practice. If the school board adds another hour kids will get so caught up on homework that will not have enough time to other activities

Kids need a distraction from school, although school is really important, kids needs to distract their minds away from everything in school, like test, wetheater or not they failing, drama, all the stress schools brings sometimes. They just a rest from everything, they need a ""stress free"" time. Kids needs time for themselfs, time to do something that's not always school.

Kids, parents, and teachers do other acitivites after school, for example kids go to football practice right after school or pian lessons, they might not be able to go. They can have doctors appointment,

since some kids get appointments late in day so they won't miss a day in school. Parents needs to go places with their kids at a specifc time, and if they come late and kids will be too tired to go with them. Teachers got palns, they need to do stuff after school, maybe their kids has a game, or they need to go to their kids rehersal and if school board extends a day, teacher would not be able to go because they are working, maybe some teachers studies after work, or they do homework if they in collage. Adding one more hour to school can ruin everyone's schudule.

In conclusion extending each school day can be a big change with time for everyone. Kids needs time for themself, they need distraction away from school and the time it's left for them to have a free time it might be nothing since they will be in school and then do homwork. Everything doesn't always have to be just about school. ",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5

For people that like to do what they do they have some stuff that make them feel acomplishwith what they do for example:

The space are were they work at.

The relation ship that they have with other workers to work together .

How hard is the job that they are doing that makes them feel comfrontable.

In the other heand the people that do not like what they do, they don't feel accomplish for this reasons for examole:

The work area is not comfortable to them.

The people do nt have a good relation ship with the workers.

The work is to hard since no one likes to help echader.

My conclution is that if we have to enjoy what we are doing even if is something that we dont like to do, or is just a person that you are working with is not good enght to work with , but it doen's not matter about what you do your idias that you have made the work that they did and the prgres that could be helpfull to expire you to do more thing to feel accomplished with your self.",3.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0

For us to be able to achieve our goal, it doesnt matter if our goal is a short goal or a long goal, first of all we have to pass some difficulties to be able to reach the goal that we want. If we want to see the results of success in our life we never have to loss the enthusiasm on it to be where we want it to be.

To reach the porpose that we want is something fantastic because only the person that fight for them know what they have had to pass to reach the goal. How can we be a support for does people that need help to reach their achievements, but for our on self is difficult to give us a impulse to reach our own goals. The things in this life are hard nothing is easy, but not impossible. What can we do for us, so we can always have the the enthusiasm high, so we can have the decisition to tell our self we got this. Sometimes there have to be a person to give us a shove to undestand that we got it. In my opinion and I say this because this happen to me all the time, I give out advice , I help those people that dont believe on there selfs no more, give them a word to push them to keep goinginto the get it and tell themnever put there self down.

Every single one that have complete a goal have had to pass on problems, that you have problemts doesnt mean that you are on the way to give up, to throw everything you have done at this point. Those problems, those failure you have had are helping you to bild your character, to change the way you see life to see the things with other prespective. I never heard someone saying that reaching something is easy, fast or simple. To be successful is something hard, its a huge feeling to get your own respect that you can do it. Being successful is something difficult to overcome, the reward is amazing. It is a nice thing to see everything whta we had go over to get where you at is just for the effort that you put on it. Is a bless to go forward in life tellingpeople how to do, what to do so they can get a advice from you to be a successful person, to try very hard to achieve their goals.

In conclusion to be a winner require to pass all difficulties that life give out. Those failure are horrible but at the end of the day of the day you will understand why did it happen. Whene you get along very well you would say now I understand how to haddle out this problems. Like i said before to achieve something is like get out of the something and enter to other failure. when the years pass out you will have create anew version of your character, personality that you construct, this new person will have the capacity to make the hard esay. In my opinion I believe that getting or achieving our goals consist on a route of failure, problems, difficulties, ect.

But some other students chose to take those courses and graduate in three years and take some classes in the summer. It up to them to chose if they want to go to college or go straight into the work and start making money to help themselves.

but I suggest graduating high school in four years is a good idea because students want to spend some time with their families before going into college if they chose or go straight into the working force. So it is not a good idea to graduate high school in three years and take summer or evening classes because it can be too much for you if you work in the summer because you will always be going back and forth from school to work and you will not have time to be with your family and go on vacations with them.

So graduating high school in three years is a bad idea because it will take up all your free time in the summer and you won't be able spend time with family and friends and you won't be able to do all the things you wanted to do after you graduate high school in three years because of all the summer classes and you have to take when you graduate high school in three years. Because when you graduate high school in four years you have all the time in the world if you don't go to college but when you have a job you can take some time of to spend some time with your family and friends.

D948703E8026,"Should the city council adoption the curfew of a 10 p. m weekday and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers?

You often hear people say that teenagers are costing more problem to other people and for the around them environment. The city council should adoption the 10 p. m midnight curfew for teenagers because teens would stay out of problems, and they would have more time to do school work.

To start, the curfew would avoid teenagers being in problem with the law. For example,teens with the curfew would not be in gangs or cost problem to others. Lets say that teens had the curfew it would expand beyond the level of doing good to others and staying out of gangs or doing bad stuff. They would be able to achieve their goals fast and force on what is next in life. Even though, this curfew sounds bad its not bad because teens would learn that the curfew is just to help them and help the environment around them.

Secondly, the curfew would allow teens with more time on their schools work and have time to force on their work. For example, teens would have more time to focus on their schools work than being on the streets with gangs. With that being said teens would have a chance of achieving their dreams and being successful in live without a bad influences. In this scenario, it show that a curfew is not bad because it has some good way in live and it allow people to do good stuff for others. Ultimately, with this curfew it allows young people to see the better side in life and it would help them to stay focus in schools by achieving their work and doing the right things.

Some people may say that having a curfew is unfairly interfere in young people lives. For example, young people have the right to choose the way they want to be. Therefor, being later in night dose not meant that young people are doing bad stuff or their are in gangs also they are just having fun in their way. Thus, being in a curfew it show young people that their are controlling by other people just because they have a different way of having fun. In this scenario, it show that having a curfew is just unfairly for teenagers just because other teens got in trouble it dose not means that all of the young people needs to have a curfew.

In conclusion, the city council would just being helpful to the young people by add a time limit. And it would help the environment around them and it would give more time and focus to the young people. All in all, it is a good thing to put a curfew because teens would have more time to spent with their family and doing good stuff for the environment.    ",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5
D9B44BD44222,"To be my self in this world I do not necessary need all the people that are around me. I can continue with life by my self. All the achievement that I been doing are made by my self because, I effort without the help of people that are around me.

In this world that I am know, I can not trust anybody because instead of wishing me the good things they wish me the worst. People sometimes are bad because they are telling me to do bad things, school does not help me to be someone in life, and they do not want me to be successful, but without them I would be someone with a better future in the world.

To make an accomplishment, I do not need all people that are around me. They are not going to help me to be successful in this world. An example is I had a friend named Generic_Name she was a nice person with me, but them she started to change. Generic_Name told me to me to skip school with her because, school is not going to help me to be someone in life. She had a misconduct with her parents. She did not stop to do bad things, so I stop talking to her because, My parents did like her anymore. I wanted to be friend with her but,what she was doing it was not good, so I need to worried about me.

To be someone in this world I have to work hard to do what I want without others around me because, when I need something or I get in a trouble they are not going to be there with me. An example is yesterday I took a test with others students in math class, and one of them told me to help him. I did not wanted to help him because, the teacher can get mad at me. After we finished the test he got closed to me, and he was complaining. I told the student that he should studied because, people are not going to be their when he needs to take a test.

Another reason to be successful in this world is that I would never give up, and will always do what even if the people said that I am not going to made it. A example is I am graduating this years and my cousin told me that I am not going to graduate because I am not very smart. I do not care what she said but, the only thing that I know is that I am trying my best to graduate this year. Sometimes I want to cry because she is always saying bad things to me. In this world I dont need nobody to be someone else even my family.

After all this, I think that I do not need people around me because they are not gonna be there to support me. Being with people that is around me is not good because, some of them would tell me to do bad things instead of doing good things. In this world that I am living right know people can killed me and cause me so much damage.

People who is a praising could be good/bad people who helps other people just like a hero, it also mean a ruler too. People who used praising could used it as a expression. Some people used praising as self-esteem to get there anger out on someone,and some peolple used it as a achievement. Some people used praising as self-esteem to ignore their pain or just get ther anger out.

some people that are using praising as a achievement is good person why becasue you can do lots of things that make other people think you are a hero or a leader. It could used it in school,wrok or in general outside the word. theres lot praising in the world. Theres fighter fighter who help people with a burning house, and theres a cop who find bad guys who deserve to go to jail like crimital or robbers. And now theres us we can help people by asking if they need help if they are strugging to carry something or they have a flat tire you can help them. Just overall help people that are struggling because peope will follow your step by seeing you do it. If you see a old lady go help her bring the stuff to her car or ask her do you need any help if she say yes then help her and if she say no then shes fine but atleast you ask because some people are watching who is helping or not.

Our world need more better people by help other people, we dont need any drama or bad stuff happen to our world like that. We need our world to be friendly so other people can visit us more. How you can make this world better is by help other peolpe that are struggling, care for each other, be friendly to other people make friends, and lastly be positive to other people who you see. The truth about praising is that it deopend on other people sees it and used it outside the world. If you used Praising for bad thats on you but if you used praising for good then yay for you your making this world a better place and envirment for other people and changing others people mind about our word we live in. Some people used praising for good and some people dont and thats okay,why beacuse people sees praising diffrently from what we see in person, and thats fine thats normal for people that dont think the same as we do.

If you grow up in a family who cares about you on what you do the whole day you know that you are lucky because not all people have the same family as you. When a teenager have a family who do not care about him he is going to end up having more problems them that one who have a good family. At this point this teenagers has to decide to be himself a man of good and make proud his family and show them what you did with out their help or end up in jail. When the person don't have support from their family they do what they can so they can have some money on their pockets and have some food on the table for their family. That is what be yourself mean care about you and your family and give to your little brothes the opportunities that you did not have. Most people take that decision when they are teenagers,that is the most hard decision to make because you are living all your past behind and trying to work hard and never go back to the same place.

DAE1AA29184B,"Should Generic_School extended school day's by two hours for four day's a week? My opinion about this is we shouldn't let this happen for many reasons for example; Students would be waking up late,People got jobs after school and responsivbles after school, Students wouldn't have time to do homework and actives after school. Having to go to school for four days would be great and all but I would rather go to school for that extra day then just four days for ten hours. Other people would agree with me and my reason why we shouldn't let this happen. I'll give you more detail reasons about why we shouldn't let this happen.

My first reason, Students would be waking up late to school, It's very important to go to school and people waking up late could cause a lot of problems with the government and with parents. The student attendance would drop a lot, Students would be waking up later on in the day, And would be missing a lot of class work in the moring that could be important. That they would have to make up which could be hard because they would have to stay after for school if we would have ten hours of school and it would be hard to do it in class. If we didn't have two hours added to are day then it would be much easier to stay after school, And students would be waking up on time and going to school more often.

Next reason,Some students have jobs after school and responsivbles. If we would have ten hours of school it would be impossibe to take care of those thing. Having a job is important some students could be going through tuff times like family issues,Some students even have kids to take care .Some students got a lot to handle that and school work and going to school. Other students they got other thing to do for example vist people family members,having chores to do around the house.

Now,My last reason would be students wouldn't have time to do homework and actives after school. There are alot of students who stay after for help with there homework, Clubs and sports,some students enjoying staying after and practicing to join the soccer team,foorball team etc. Students even have time to work on there homework when they get out of school. If we would have added two more hours then we wouldn't have sport or staying after, It would probably be late and teachers don't want to stay longer then they should and parnets could get worryed about the kids for staying longer. These actives could affect students class work, How tired the students get and sore when they come back from school.

In conclusion, We shouldn't add two more hours to the school day for four days a week it could affect students attendents and how they act with others,People have jobs and responsivbles after school and students actives and homework. That's why we should keep the school days nomal and how long we stay in school. Student's come to school on time and prepare to learn. They do want they have to do after school and everyone is happy with that,Others will be unhappy if we would add two more hours to are day.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

If you think showing kindness is a waste don't think that because showing some kindness can show the other person that you care about them. Also you can think that not showing enough kindness is bad then you wrong because even just a little bit can show yourself and the other person that you care and that you nice. Even though your not the type of person to show kindness to others can change about what the other person thinks about you like maybe the person thinks oh like this person doesn't care about me. But when the person show kindness can change the option on what the person is thinking about you.

For instance, a lot of people choose to follow the anti-Semitic politics of Hitler and the Nazis because they were afraid of the death because the Nazis convinced them to follow them. Indeed, by setting a good example you success to convince them because you use both of the major things to influence, the feelings and the acts. You try to reach his heart by the sensitivity and by the concrete you show him that it is easy to do it. In this way, when you are setting a good example you are using the feelings of the people in order to show them the better behavior to adopt. The fear, the happiness, the solemnity can influence a choice of a person and that is why it is the better way to persuade. Through the fashion, the advertisements, the politics the sensitivity is always utilized to change the mind of someone. The behavior is the only thing that can help someone to change their opinion because trough it you can transmit all of your feelings to your speaker. Furthermore, people can be persuade by acts more easily than by words. So, by setting a good example, you can also influence people by showing them the better way to do something. Although people disagree with philosopher, physician, and humanitarian like Albert Schweitzer and affirm that there are better ways to convince someone, people should consider that to set a good example is the better way to persuade somebody.

Firstly, the behavior is using the feelings to convince people. Indeed, whatever things you do to influence someone you use their feelings. And this is the best way because the feelings are something that stay in your mind and touch you directly and can let you do things even bad. The first example is in politics. A politician who takes a solemn tone and does a serious, and sad speech will influence your opinion and by modifying your state of mind he will transmit these feelings to show you what he wants you to think. Martin Luther King said: ""I have a dream"" so immediately you know that this dream is something anchored in his heart and he will give you all of his arguments to persuade you. Then, the second example is advertisement. As well as the fashion than the TV shows, each publicity lets you feel so be it fear, so be it happiness. They carry away people with them in their opinion and by choosing beautiful musics or pictures they help the spectator to feel the good vibes that the actors or advertising want to give you.

Secondly, by setting a good example you can convince people to do acts. The first reason is people of our generations need to see to trust someone. And this is the reason why you need to show the example to someone to help him to trust you and give him the directions to follow. It was always easier to speak instead of to act but people want to see to know this is the better choice. For example, when you are doing shopping most of the girls prefer doing it in the shop instead of in line because women want to see their clothes to try them and be convinced this dress or this shirt is the better. The other reason is that you always want to have a concrete thing. So when you show the example you demonstrate that what you do is possible and affordable to you all and you encourage them to do it with you and this is what influence others. You give a proof of concrete and the speaker only need a little bit of will. For example during an humanitarian mission, if you are the leader of this one you need to show them the example not only with your behavior but also in what you must accomplish. If you are here to rebuild a public building you will do it with the volunteers to help them and lead the group.

To conclude, the example is the best way to influence people for two reasons. The first one is obviously the aspect of the feelings. The transmission of a posture or opinion can help you to do a choice. The second one is the aspect of the concrete part. You give the example of what to do and the others can do it easily. Finally, there is not better way to convince people as Albert Schweitzer said. Because there is only one way which combines feelings and action and it is the good example by your own behavior.         ",4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5

The failure comes before of success So, I think that everybody had a failure in their lives but I think that is good because we are learning about our failure and I think that the failure is important becuse with the our failures we can be a better people for the socity or community. I think like Generic_Name goes to university and fail science class, Generic_Name had a failure but he can think about it what happen or that is wrong in science class and then, Generic_Name study a lot for recover science class. the final of semester Generic_Name recover science class, Generic_Name had a success because Generic_Name study a lot to recover science class and Generic_Name doesn't loss the hope to recover science class. So I think that the success is good for us because the success make us better. I believe that my failure that I had before that help me to be a better person to learn more to do thinks that I don't believe that i can do and the thing that a have is thanks of my success that I had it.

DCDED7261D03,"""Your character will be what yourself choose to make it"" everyone should be free of deciding their own character this is important because it can help with being more confident about yourself while making difficult choices, making clear what your goals for the future are, and makes easier to show who you really are to other individuals . In the other way some people believe that our character is formed by the difficulties and influences beyond our control.

First, feeling confident about yourself is one of the best ways to succeed in life, it makes easier when deciding difficult choices, sometimes when people go through difficult moments in their lives, being confident with their self can help them choosing the best decision by just looking at the positive way of their decisions. For example, every time people visit a new locations they should feel confident with their selves while creating new friendships or business.

Secondly, setting your goals is not as easy as it sounds, because you have to know what you really want, when people know what their goals are they have to work really hard and encourage their selves to achieve it. If people chose their own character its easier to set their goals because they really know who they are. For example, one of my goals is to graduate from high school. So,I need to put a lot of effort and hard working to achieve it.

In the other way, some people claim that our character if formed by the influences beyond our control, some of those difficulties might be what your parents want or economic resources. Also, when people let others create their life choices or character they don't enjoy their life as how they want to enjoy it. Foe example, if your you let your parents decide what to do with your future, you might don't like that decision and that would not be really who you are.

In addition, making your own character influence in how you show others who you truly are, this is important because, it feels better doing something that you chose and want than doing something that other individuals what you to do or difficult situations.

In conclusion, I am agree with ""John's"" quote because everyone should be able do decide what that really want to become, feeling confident with their selves, having clear all their goals and work hard to achieve them all, your character shouldn't be former by influences beyond their control. You should be able to show everyone who you really are.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0

DD66EBC605D1,"Some schools offer the option of attending classes by ""online"" or ""video conferencing"". This may not be a good idea because how does the student going to get responsible? or how can the teachers know if the student is not cheating on a test?. Is there any benefit to know is this option is going to help the student phsychlogy, mentally or physically?. Education is too important! And a better way of learning is by attending to SCHOOL! The way as many people done it. Also, by this way attending to school students might join in sports, activities, etc. It gives more benefits and helps to refresh your mind. School gives classes of ""PE"" which is important because doing sports is healthy.

In 2015, a student at Generic_School took the option to attend classes by online because the student was not a ""social"" person which means the student did not like to communicate. But after all the student did regret it. The student noticed that communication is too important because is part of education and how to success in life. The words of the student to advice the students were "" There is no more benefits than attending to school. School does help you to your knowdlegde and prepare you for your future. Did not like the fact of waking up too early and to deal with all those people every single day, but here is the thing as people we cannot avoid people. It does affect you plus It does not make sense at all. Why? because WE ARE THE PEOPLE. What I learned by taking this option and what made me regret it was : We are the community, we are the voice of the world and as a group working together we can make big changes and a better society as well. And classes from home by the way online or video conferencing, this does not give you ""P.E"" classes and doing sports is wealthy. So by now attending to school is the best option for everyone."" The student had excellent grades, scholarships, made new friends than he expected to have. Where is he now by making the best option? He is now at SCHOOL_NAME preparing for his major as a lawyer. He became an example for many students that have the same issues as he had.

As an immigrant this is a real big request, they must attend classes by going to school. It is too important because the lack of language and credits are needed. United States is an immigrant country and their schools has these excellents programs called ""Esol"". Of course, immigrants need these kind of help. They need to get involved by attenting to school. Why? Many immigrants come to this country to have a better future, they absolute have different customs, a different kind of thoughts, etc. So that infers a lot more than you think...Especially, each country have a different system's programs for graduation like in South America you only need to pass all of your classes for graduation, but how many classes are they? More than 17 classes. In United States you need to pass all of your classes plus the SOLS. This is the reason why immigrants must attent to school, It does help you to refresh your mind, to have new thoughts, new experiences, and to know what you need for graduation. Its is hard because Immigrants needs an esol teacher and to not attend to normal classes for awhile as long as you learn the language.That is why it takes a little longer for them to graduate and that is why they do need to attent to school. To understand much better the topics of each SOL class because they do need credits as any student. Otherwise if they choose the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is not going to help them as much as the school will.

In conclusion, a better learning is by attending classes from school because school give you more opportunites, more methods of learning, to socialized, to communicate. It inpires you to keep going and to have an idea of what you want your future to be like. Which means it prepares you for life. Any issue that you have they will help you to work on it, to find a solution. Like this student did not like to communicate at all, but he noticed that attending to school is the best option because it gives you the ideas of what you want to do, the opportunity to meet the college you want to go. To know what you can do to improve yourself! Also, It helps immigrants to learn the language with this program to pass your SOL classes to graduate, they receive a double help from school. Going to school has more benefits than you think so you need to fight for it because anything in this life is not easy, but is worth it.

DDB673D3627D,"Who wants to work alone by themselves when you have the chance to work together with a group of students in your class. Working together is more beneficial because with a group you can get all the work done more faster and students are less worried. Many students should work together as a team in school because it helps them with good life skills life. People might need this to help them when working at a job in the future. I agree that working with a group is more efficient and help students learn more better. Benefits of working with a group is more beneficial because allows students to collaborate, allows different ideas or opinions from peers, and allows each individual to have feedback from peers.

However not everyone would agree with this position. Some people believe that benefits of working alone is more helpful for themselves. For example, when a students is working on the computer for a certain projects in fashion marketing, fitness and foods or other subjects in school because they're able to finished it themselves. This explains that people can put their own ideas and will get the work done more quicker without any help from peers during class. Nevertheless the oppositions over looks other important points.

First reason is that student can collaborate with other peers but only about 30% of people work together with other people on school projects assignments or activates. For example, in classrooms students have more possible chances to separate the task with each other. Also people would't have to worried about not getting each slides done because their peers would be there to support them. This shows that students who work together with peers they are not only benefiting themselves but helping other people too. Students can enjoy and have fun working with friends also everyone will get a good grade.

Second reason is students can come together as a team by listening and hearing out all of their peers creative ideas and opinions in a group on the project. For example, each person might have a good suggestion or reason on a history project that will help their group with the assignment. This shows a person will have many ideas that they can chose from a peer in their group and it's always nice to use different reasons from a student.

Third reason is when a student can get a individuals feedback to help them on a english writing essay in class. For example, the person is writing a essay for class on Google docs with each other it helps them talk and get feedback from a peer or friend in class. This shows that having a students help is important because you can fix the error in the essay with a peers correction and students can learn more better together from people.

To conclude that working with a group is more better for people because allows students to collaborate with peers so that people can separate the task with each other, allows different ideas or opinions from peers when each person has good suggestions for projects and allows individuals to get feedback from peers on helping a students with a english writing essay. Maybe good for students to work alone but working in a group is helpful to have someone support them.                                                  ",3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,3.0
DDCB2CC96EA7,"I am strongly agree the failures in our lifes means to keep going and be a successful person. Although some say success not consists of going from failure because people always fell many times keeping doing the same mistakes in several times in their lifes, actually success consists of going from failure because failure help us to learn more in our lifes and get experiences to teach other people.

Those who believe success not consists of going from failure have they reasons. One reason people always fell many times keeping doing the same mistakes in several times in their lifes. But doing the same mistakes many times does not help people to be successful; makes the person wake in front of others. People that are better to them can make bullying at them because they feel that they are perfect than others .Many of the people that keep thinking that they are a loser think about diying is the better thing to get out of the failures. Did you know is that 90% 0f the teenagers kill them self instated of find help to keep going with their lifes. It is very scary and make me sad at the same time. If we use social medias we can see people talking about their lifes or using drugs and drugs makes the person to lose more their mind.

However, success consists of going from failure because failure help us to learn more in our lifes. Learning from failure to failure is better for all the people. Having the enthusiasm in our mind can be the better word to start our life every day. We are capable of doing many things it does not matter how many times we have to do the same things to be better in our feature but we have to keep going not matter what. In my position I have a experience; when I was in my country I did not what to do with my life; I just was trying to finish my middle school, get a job and then have a family and now here I am making better things for my life; now I am tinking about to have a better life. when I came to USA I was tinking about how am I going to do if I do not nothing about the language but now I feel more conformist knowing the language because makes me keep going studying. I though that learning another language was a new obstacle for me to keep going we my life.

Also, success consists of going from failure because people get experiences to teach people. There are many people that think that they are failure and they are not; I think that every people are genius. The things is that people don not let the talents get out and that can be because they think about others people opinions about them. I have many experiences keep seeing people about failure. Had you ever try to help others? I have it done many times. When I was in my country I saw this person trying to be better but at the same time this person was with many problems that did not let to keep going. In many occasion I help the person to be better like getting solutions with the problems and it is very difficul to teach others with the problems and try to make them better.

Seeing our life in a failure can be the worst thing, but keeping trying to do better things each day is going to be the better effort in our life and that is going to help us to get more enthusiastic every day. It is very helpful to find ways to be better in the world because every person had to have new things to do the life better for themselves and help others if they are struggling with their life.

The school board should add one and a half hours to school each day because the students can learn more, they can use their time wisely, they can improve the understanding skills of the students.

The school board should add one and a half hours to school day because all the students can learn more. A long time period can make all the students to get a good knowledge about their chapter or topic, So, most of the students might started to get good grades on their tests. The students can take their time to do their own work. So, all of them can discuss about their projects. Sometimes the students can finish their homeworks during the class periods. That might save the time for everyone. Firstly, the students can get some more knowledge is a reason why the school boards should add one and a half hours to school each day.

Another reason is, all the students can use their time wisely in the class. The students will be more into their study at that time rather than their phones. So, the time will be more useful to them. The students can finish their all work in the class. So, they can get some extra time to spend with their family and relatives. Sometimes, the students can get some extra time to read books. And that can improve their reading skills. Secondly, using the time properly is another reason why the school board should add one and a half hours to school each day.

Although, some people may argue that, adding one and a half hours to school each day is stressful to all the studens. But, believe me or not, all the teenage students are always on their phones. So, it isn't a bad idea to add one and a half hours to school each day. At least, they can't be in the touch of their electronic devices for one and a half hours! Lastly, for a better understanding skills the school board should add one and a half hour to school each day. The teachers can explain the chapter or the topic by taking their time.

That will be more beneficial for the whole class. Good learning or understanding skills is the last reason why the school board should add one and a half hours to school each day.

Adding one and a half hour to school is beneficial to all the students for their future.

Praising students who did a great job will feel amazing and also, it helps to have a better self-steem. Students feel great when someone is praising them so, this help they to feel better and happy.

DEC2A1A6A1CA,"The famous Albert Einstein always said ""Imagination is more important than knowledge"". I agree with this amazing quote because without imagination you wouldn't be yourself. As a kid everyone has always imagined of them being like or better then someone. These are my reasons of why I agree with the famous Albert Einstein.

First of all, without an imagination you wouldn't have dreams to succeed. Myself for example I've always wanted to be a professional soccer player. But than I realized that soccer isn't very popular in America. So than i started playing football and I enjoy playing that sport very much. Since than I've always imagine of being a professional football player.

Secondly, imagination is an everyday thing you use it everyday in many ways. Imagination is like an opinion,no one can take that from you. It can be positive nor negative either way no one can change the way you think. Imagination is everything because you always imagine or wish you were doing something or wish you were with someone. As a person that has dreams to succeed you need imagination to achieve them.

As one can see,me as a football player. I use my imagination a lot for many reasons. Because I am very competitive when it comes to sports, I always want to be better than the old me. I always want to be one step ahead from everyone. For that reason I think I use my imagination a lot. Like if I ever lose at something I would think about it and say ""imagine if I won"".

DEDCC703F6FC,"Some school districts offer programs that allow high students to gradute in three years instead of the traditional four years. In my opinion, I feel like it is a good idea for some school districts to allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years.

The reason on why I feel like it is a good idea for students to graduate early is for Job oppurtunity, Entering college early and also Moving other places and starting a whole new life without no worries on education no more. Job oppurtunity's will help you out to save money, working on what you like doing and also find some jobs can help you get into college if you are interested. For example, I am studying about autotechnology and it is my second year doing it. My plans are to continue working on cars and hopefully find a job at a dealership so I can learn enough at college.

Another reason on why I feel like allowing students to graduate in three years instead of four is so that they can start off there future earlier than others by attending college. Entering college early is a good thing because you have some time to pick and decide on what you might want to study and learn about so you can get your masters on it or so that you can finish early and move onto what's next on your accomplishments in life. My school has the option to do Dual Enrollment which basically means starting college already and getting already college credits and still having to be in high school.

Finally, another reason on why I feel like graduating high school earlier than others is to have the chance to move to another country or state and start a brand new. Starting a brand new life can become very hard and very stressful. Starting a new life moving somewhere else means finding a better job oppurtunity, finding a olace to live in your budjet and also finding new people to hang around with but in my opinion at the end it will all be worth it. Some students are already looking somewhere to move on there own or with a roomate because they might be having problems at home that they don't want to deal with. At the same time of moving to another place you have to make sure that you are ready on what's about to come into your life. For example, paying bills, paying rent, house supplies and also if you have a vehicle make sure that your payments are on time.

In conclusion, I feel like allowing high school students to graute in three years instead of the traditional four years is a good idea. Job oppurtunity, Entering college early and also Moving to another state or country in my opinion are one of the main important things to focus on after finishing high school.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5
DF785B00E2A2,"I think to working in group will be more beneficial for me, Some reason the

I prefer to work in a group is becouse will can share ideas and opinions that way will be get better grade, Another examples will be, every one in the group will found diferent information and that way we can pick the better information before to proceeding to writng and finich the work.

And another hand my central opinion to work in group will give you the best beneficial because if one of the student get sick the other student can continued to work, that way we can not stop working. And alway work together will supported the idea with the specific information,

Another importan examples is if you working in group you can asked to you group for help, you can shere the work, either one in the group can provide the better ideas and following information in order,

that way all together we can planned the work before writing.

Athoner reason for work in group in my personal opinion is feel more beneficial because you not work alone, that way is less stresfull for each student because every one share the work.

And some time for one reason one of the student has a emergency and the position the best option is work in group because will be more beneficial for each student and the way all the rest of the group can countinued wokt.

and still whole group will be get same grade, however they work together in the group.

In conclusion working with a group is the best, in my personal opinion, I prefer to work in group because the way I improve my work,

working in group is the better way to work because we has many benefits like share ideas, imformation, etc,

and the end I hope you prefer aech student has to keeping work in group.

DF9E11F7A06E,"Ralph Waldo Emerson says""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered,you will never grow.""On one hand,some people disagree with statement. On the other hand,some people agree with this statement. People should try to do something beyond what they have already mastered since their confident level will grow,it makes them feel good,and make their live easier.

However,not everybody agree with position,some people claim that people can grow in live without trying something new because they don't want to get out of their comfort zone and try new things. Nevertheless,this opposition other important,namely that trying new things give us a high level of confident. For example,my biggest fear in live is airplanes and i never been on it,but if i try it for the first time in my live even i scare or not next time,i would have more confident for trying new thing since when the airplane was my biggest fear and i try it. I could do more. Further more, trying new things make our confident level high which is an important thing in our live.

In addition,it makes us feel good. For instance,my cousin was always sad and she hated to try new things. One day we went swimming,everyone had fun except my cousin. After condensing her for a long time,she try it. On that time,my cousin was so happy that she even wants to be a swimmer now. Thus,people should try new things to make them feel good and happy.

Finally,it makes the live easy. To illustrate,if someone be so strike in live and doesn't wants to try something beyond what he/she already mastered,that person will have a hard live. The person will never grow in live since he/she scares to get out the comfort zone and try new thing. Moreover,we should get out of our comfort zone so we could have an easy live.

Based on this argument,one must conclude,people never get better unless they try new things in live. In the whole,Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement was true based of the reasons.",2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0
E03B6B157C32,"""Does true self-esteem comes from praise or does it come from achievement."" Self-esteem comes from achievement because it makes you feel good. It makes you feel that you could do anything. Also you can learn not to give up.

Self-esteem comes from achieving, it will make you feel good about yourself. For example, if Generic_Name achieves shooting five times at the three point line and makes all of them; he will feel good about himself. His self-esteem is feeling good so he may try to do more next time at the three point line. But feeling good about yourself is not the only thing that will help with your self-esteem.

Another is it will make you feel that you could do anything. For example, if Generic_Name wins the art fair only in her class, but the school is having an art fair for the whole sophomore class. Her self-esteem will kick in and she may sign up

Also you can learn how to not give up for example if Generic_Name lose the class discussion but the class is going to have another one the next day she is going to try her hardest to win the next class discussion.

I think that achievement will help kids with their learning because nowadays kids like winning and winning things at the end it makes their self-esteem built up.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0
E0553AEE109E,"Most students enjoy having a long summer vacation, but others prefer it not to be so long. Schools usually do three months for a summer break, but people argue that there should only be a month of summer break. Also have a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall. I do not think this is a good idea. Even though, when it is time to come back to school students will have forgotten everything, it is nice to have a long summer break because people go on vacation a lot, students can have an opportunity to work full time, and reduces stress for students.

Educators should have a long summer break because people go on vacation a lot to see long distance relatives, or to just spend some quality time with family and have fun. For example, if you live in Virginia it will be a long car ride to make it to Florida or any other place. You will need a long break to plan your trip and have enough time to stay at any place you will go. Other people do not necesarily go on trips to just see family maybe it is a gift or a tradition that families have. Having time is the most important thing when it comes to going on a vacation.

Another reason why it is a necesity for students to have a long summer break is because most students will get to work full time and make more money of their own. Most parents like their child to learn how real life is and what struggles you have to got through to get the things you want. Being a teenager will make you want more things it is the age you will start to drive and experience new things. For example, you will get to the age of driving and you will ask your parents for a car. You will need to earn some money to help your parents out they might give you an estimate amount of how much they can give you, but if that is not enough for you then you need to find a job to get to where you want to be at. If you have a part time job you will eventually get to where you want to be, but it will take longer that is why having a full time job will be easier to get there. To have a full time job it means summer break needs to be longer.

Finally, my last reason why summer should be long for students is because it reduces stress for students. Being in school all year is hard for most students because sometimes is not just school what you have to deal with it can be things going on at home. Having to deal with both is difficult, so it is nice to have a long summer break to get a break from things. For example, if you keep failing tests it might be because you can not manage to study at home. After failing tests, having bad grades, your parents yelling at you for it, pressuring you to do better, and having other things to deal with that will make you have stress. It is important for students to be able to have a long summer break so they can get their minds off in a lot things and have less stress.

Overall, having a long summer break means people will run out of things to do there should still be a long break because people go on vacations a lot, students can have an opportunity to work full time, and it reduces stress for students. A long summer break means more fun and less stress. Most schools have three months of a break and people are used to having a three month long summer break, so there will be a lot of arguments into why change it now. It is best to just keep it the way it has always been. Having long summer breaks also results in a lot of solutions for people. ",5.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5
E069D2A8AE1E,"Have you had a friend sharing wisdom and experiences with you? You probably had that a million times. Here is the thing though. People just want to learn the experience of you and the others, which isn't a bad thing. It's also important to learn each other's experiences. I think it is important to learn from other people's experiences because you get to understand who they are, you can help the person if they're in a situation, and you can communicate each other. To clarify this, let's dig in deeper.

First, I think it's important that you understand who they are because you get to know about their favorite hobbies, the places they like to visit, the pets they have and their dream vacation. Getting to know on who the person is can give you a good start off to make a bond, or form friendship between you and that person. If you shared your experiences with a person, they might feel interested on what you're talking about. Telling a person on what you like can bring that person's attention deeper.

Second, it's important that you help the person if they're in a situation because you can cheer them up if they lost a family member. Helping someone out can make that person feel better and most of all, feel comfortable, and they will think that you're a good person. If you didn't reach out and help somebody, they could start getting into a tougher situation where they might not be able to handle by themselves. They could also feel very lonely or left out, and that is not okay.

Third, communicating with others is important because you can text them in Social Media, such as Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook. You can also go shopping with them. Communicating others bring closer friendship, and keep the bond strong between you and you're friend. Watching movies and hanging out at each others house are another examples of communication. They're lots of ways to communicate with your friends and other people, and that is a good thing for friends. Activities is another thing for communicating with other people because sometimes, when people do activities, it provides teamwork.

In Conclusion,

I think it is important to learn from other people's experiences because you get to understand who they are, you can help the person if they're in a situation, and you can communicate each other. So now that you understand, think about these as you make new friends. Question yourself on how to get a good start to form a bond between you and that person. Try to reach out and help him/her if they need help with something. Make that person feel comfortable by hanging out with them at lunch or at home. They might need good company from you!

Well one good reason on why working with a group is a good idea my opionion is because by working in a group you can find different details on what the teacher given what to work on in a group yall can bring up all the information yall came with or got from the internt and have argument about which one should be the best answer. Another reason on why is a good idea working with in a group it's a easy way to get a better garde as a group and working in a group is really fun you get to talk and use the computer sometimes the teachers let us use our phone and we make like a little group chat for us to talk about the work she told us to do and share our answers on the group chat and see who agree with it or who don't and we all got different reasons and at the end of the day we pick the support detail and use it.

E103955391AB,"Yeah we all have our own freedom but well that's not always true a lot of people let others control them. So it is said

Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote "" To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment""

Like i said we all have our own idividuality that what makes us we have our own way of being, own name and own way of looking we are just our selves. Specifically individuality shows us that not everything should be given to you if you want something you work hard for it but also it's a sign of your own development that you can do everthing by your self but it's because you are who you are and no one can change you. Therefore, itis proven that it's better to be individual than anybody else just giving you everything by hand .

""FREEDOM!"" is a good word all of us love to hear. When you realize you can do anything by yourself you feel like no one can stop or as free as the wind but theres always going to be obsticles without a doubt. To be Indivdual it can happen to any one such as a kid who has learned to do thier stuff alone or when you move out of your parents house and get your own home. It honestly can happen to anyone becuase thiers so many types to define the word individual. well to fell free is not a bad thing after all .

When your individual you mean something to this world because you think about yourself. You set your own goals and accomplish them and you maintian yourself the way you are it's even more better becuase it's the hugest goal anybody should have to not let anybody change you wreck all you have accomplished. To your self you feel like you value your self and it's not bad at all to value yourself because it biulds self confidence within you and that means you have you feet on the ground and yeah your ready to face any obsticale.

No one should define you except you because the world will defenitly try to change you but if you don't aceppt it won't happen like Author Ralph Waldo Emerson said ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" whom we have someone to look up to and understand that to be inividual is okay.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0
E17E9E75ECEB,"It wouldn't even matter if the school lunch changes to healthy food. Even until this day they still don't change to a heathly choice. Students has tried to make the school lunch meals change, but there wasn't any difference. Sometimes the studentst doesn't make good healthy food choice there will be times that the lunch menu will have healthy choices and not so heathly choices. For example: the lunches gives us two options one is pizza and the other rice with chicken, students will definitly go for pizza.

It would be a good idea that the school lunches menu changes to a healthy menus. We do need to consider other students and their eating habbits, most students doesn't even eat, they even go a whole day without eating. If the school were to change the unhealthy food they should get rid of pizza, hot dogs, and chicken nuggets and make up for potatos with rice and chicken, a nice pasta salad with tomatoes, onions, and, spinich. Some students are vegan so maybe they can have a veggie burger anything with veggies. If that's the case to change school lunch menu, the school should consider about how and where they should spend money on things like changing the floor tiles it's unnecessary it could have been for something better. No one really cares about how bad the school lunch is, it's not worst thing in the world. Anyways thats why us students have to be smart and bring our own food to school like most of them do.

In reality, it really doesn't matter because students still eat school food, some students do complain about how nasty the food is but they still won't bring their own food how logical is that. To be honest there are sometimes good lunches like we said before it's not best thing in the world. So it's okay don't waste on changing something when you knew it could of been done from the start.

E18675E47293,"Dear,

School Board of Education

I personally disagree with the idea of adding one and a half hours of school. This is a terrible Idea and here are some reasons why I disagree so please grab a seat, relax, and take your time to read this. The first reason why there shouldn't be extra school hours is students will have to walk in the dark. The second reason is students will have less time for sports and other after school activities and also less time for family and friends. And finally students will be sick of having school for a such a long period of time and possibly stop going to school.

First of all not everyone is fortunate enough to have a ride to school but that doesen't mean that they can't go to school so they walk, but if the school board adds more school time students who walk will have to walk in the dark. Walking in the dark could be very dangerous because you don't know whats in front nor what's behind you and that could cause students not to go to school anymore because they will be scared of walking in the dark and feel unsafe. Another example of why it could be dangerous to walk in the dark is if someone is trying to cross the street and a car doesen't see them they'll probably get ran over and the school won't be responsible for the accident. Something that also is good to keep in mind is that if the school hours get changed and even if you try to avoid students from walking in the dark There's a cost. You'll have to put street lights and that could be very expensive, and the money could be used for educational purposes.

The second reason why extra school hours shouldn't be added is students won't have much time for sports or other after school activities. Sports and school are both important and they both should be equally balanced. So if school gets longer than maybe we'll have less time to see our family and friends. I remember when I did football practice was getting shorter and shorter because winter came, and during that time it was also raining a lot and snowing a lot so we missed a lot of games and practices, imagine if school was an hour and a half long, there wouldn't even be a football season at all.

The last reason why an extra hour and a half of school is a bad idea is because, a lot of students would get really sick of school and stay home or try to get suspended so that they don't have to got to school. We've all been in that situation where we don't want to go to school so we pretend we're sick, even I get tired of having to go to school every day, in fact I don't really want to be here right now but I have to. We've all tried to make our parents believe that we're sick, but that's a really old trick and parents already know it, and make us go to school. If students get more school time they just won't stand it and they'll start skipping school. But don't worry I won't do that.

In conclusion I think adding an extra hour and a half of school is a horrific idea, it will just cause more problems for the education system, students, parents, and even for our hard working teachers because they will have a more work and less time for themselves. But I also understand why you would want to add an extra hour of school.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5
E19E1BEB08EA,"I feel that working with a partner is more beneficial to students. Working with partners gets students extra help when in need. It can make new friends while working on big projects. Also it makes the work get done easier and quicker when working in big groups. I also personally think that any project with a presentation should be a group project. If that presentation has more than just the presentation it should be a three person group.

Working with a partner is beneficial to students, because it gives extra support or help on a project or classwork. If a project is too big and impossible for one person to complete they could split up the work. For example, when I had a final project in my english class; I separated the work with my partner. We had to do an essay and a PowerPoint presentation. My partner did the essay and did the PowerPoint presentation and we both finished in time. If I hadn't had my partner, I probably would not have finished the project in time. My teacher making it a group project made it way easier to do because I didn't have to worry about writing essay.

Another reason that working with partners is beneficial to students is that they can build new friendship while doing work. When students are doing work in groups, they are together the whole class and have to stay in contact outside of school. For example, when I was working on a video for my journalism class I had a very big video that was due in a few days. I made good friends with the people that were in that group because we spent the whole class together and staying in contact after school. Every time I'm making a video I want to work with them because I know they will do a good job.

Another way that working in partner benefits students is that it saves them time and makes them finish their work quicker. If the students split up their work and do their work efficiently they will finish quickly. The more group members will make it even quicker. For example, when I was working with a friend and two other students on a project for a book we finished the book very quickly and the book review was finished very quickly as well. When partners are helping each other it makes everything way easier and more fun as well, because you get to hang out with your friends while being productive.

Also if the teacher lets students pick people, they can pick people that know a lot about the topic of the project or classwork. For example, in when I had spanish we did a project about Puerto Rico and since I'm from Puerto Rico everyone wanted to pick me. I went to a group where a good friend of mine was and the project was very easy to finish and present. The project was done so quickly that the next class we had free time for the whole class. That's another reason why working in groups is so beneficial and good.

Working with partners can also make students more comfortable with the subject or the project. Students sometimes get handed a project or classwork without knowing what to do. Having a partner to help the out is great so they can get comfortable with the subject or the project. For example, when I was Earth and Space Science I had no idea what to do on a project the teacher was assigning. She assigned partners and my partner told me what to do and I finally understood. The project took us about two days to finish but it was a very hard project to do that would have been impossible to finish alone.

Groups of at least three people should be required for project of more than 2 assignments. Two people can't do a project with five assignments and should have that extra person to split up the work and no one does extra work. For example, when I was in the sixth grade I had a project where I had to write about Mozart's story and I had to write an two paragraphs, buy and design a poster board, and also give a presentation and memorize everything. I did the essay but forgot to do the poster board until the night before. I had to stay up to 12:30 at midnight doing the poster and memorizing the 2 paragraphs. If the teacher would have made it a group project, I wouldn't have had to worry about the poster because my group members were on top of it.

Another reason that groups of at least three people benefit students is that maybe one of the students doesn't want to do any work there's still another group member left that wants to do the work. For example, my english teacher gave us a presentation to do on PowerPoint and we split up the slides. But one of the group members didn't do anything, so the other group member and me had to do all of his work. We presented got points and he didn't. That's why it's so important to have groups of at least three people, because you still have a backup.

Some people say working alone is beneficial for students because you only have to worry about yourself and no one else. However, if you work with a group or a partner the work gets done quicker and easier. While doing your work you can also make new friends and get help from them. Also, it helps pick out partners for the future that you know that those people will execute and do their work. For example, when I was working on a video for my journalism class I had a very big video that was due in a few days. I made good friends with the people that were in that group because we spent the whole class together and staying in contact after school. Every time I'm making a video I want to work with them because I know they will do a good job and be productive.

I feel that working with a partner is more beneficial to students. Working with partners gets students extra help when in need. It can make new friends while working on big projects. Also it makes the work get done easier and quicker when working in big groups. Bigger projects have to be at least a three person group because two people can't handle big projects by them selves and should have extra help. That's why it's so beneficial for students to work with partners on projects and other big classworks. ",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.5
E1AE7FDD072F,"Should students participate in extracurricular activities? There are many diffrenet activities for students, not only sports, but clubs and many more. There is other to life then school and activities. Students should have the ability to choose what they want to do in the extra time they have. Schools already take half of the students time with going to school and homework .I disagree that students must have an extracurricular activity because they could learn a new language, do better in school, and spend time with family and friends.

First, students can learn another language besides their own. First, the language that they pick helps them with their applecation to colloge and in the real word. For example, it is more likely for a student that have two or three languages to be accepted in a colloge, unlike the student that only knows one. Second, students could communicate with others around the world. For example, if they learned Spanish, they can talk to others in Spain or around other that speak the same language. Third, they could be the only one that learned that language in your class or school. In conclusion, these were the advantges of learning a new language.

Second, teenagers that are struggling in school could take their time and have an advantage to be better in school. First, they could study for their coming exams and be able to focus on them. For example, students could make study groups or study buddies for studying better. Second, after school students can get extra help from their teachers. For example, they would only focus on the students weak part on the subject. Third, they could make up for the extra work they missed from their classes. For example, a student is sick or had a docters appointment they could make up that work at home after school. In conclusion, students would do better in school with the extra time they have.

Third, we need to spend time with family and friends. First, help your family with work around the house. For example, help your mom cook for dinner,or help your dad fix his computer,or help your siblings with homework. Second, you could hang out with your old friends. For example, go to mall,watch a movie ,or go to their house. Third, get to know eachother better. For example, play Never Have I Ever, Truth or Dare,and many more fun games you could play. In conclusion, spending more time with family and friends could grow you a stronger relashionship.

In conclusion, I disagree that students have to have an activity because students can learn a language, have better outcomes on their report cards, and have quality time with friends and family. These were some reasons to not have an extracurricular activity. The principal should not force any student that do not want to do an activity make them. Students must have their own right to do what the want. Go stop extracurriculars!",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0
E1B30D0F1F11,"Do you ever just wonder how school would be like if you could pick your own classes/electives? My opinion is that students should not be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class. There are many reasons why I think the above. Sudents are capable of choosing whats best for them and what they like to do. Counselors or teachers should not be picking students or electives. Student want to be taking or doing many things that they are into to. I think that music, drama, or an art class should be electives.

Strudents are capable of choosing whats best for them and what they like to do because they want to do what intesrests them. For example, I do not like to take music, it bores me. I would rather take drama. People are very diferent from each other. Such as music, drama, and art should be extra credit for students that are interested in thiose kind of electives/classes. We just need to give students a chance to do their own things and be choosing their own kinds of thing.

Counselors or teachers should not be picking students electives. The reason why I think this is because all electives should not be classes in general. For example, some people like math, instead of students taking an art class, ect. They can be taking another math class. If thats what they love learning about because with art, we cant do anything with it in the future. Which in math we mostly use it and need it in everything.

Students want to be doing many things that they love in school. Yes, that is very true. CLASSES THAT ARE FOR FUN SHOULD BE ELECTIVES!! Not required. We should just think about what we like to do best. Everyone should be able to pick their own classes.

In conclusion, music, drama, and art should not be required. Student like to do what they like best. Counselors/teachers should be picking those classes for us.",2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0
E1B9CAF68CA7,"Hilary Clinton, soccer players, people in the government everyone had failed once in their life time. Everyone is not complete. We are humans we make mistakes and we fail.

Failure without loss of enthusiasm is the best thing people can do. We gain experience by failing. We learn not to give up and chase our dreams. We learn how to be patient and deal with problems. We never know when is the best time to do something or to get something so be patient. my parent told me that""good things will come to you just be patient""

Although, after failing once most of the people lose hope and stop trying. Nevertheless, it is not easy to start over because it gets boring working on same thing over and over and people give up on their dreams.

To begin, failing help people to gain more experience. When we do same thing over again it makes our work easier. For example when we fail the test at school and we have to retake it we already know what mistake we did for the test so we do not repeat it. This shows that we will try harder when we get the chance to do it again. Clearly we will be successful next time.

Furthermore, we learn not to give up when we fail for the first time. Giving up is not the best thing to do after failing. For instance, we can make a whole new plan and ways to do our work. This shows that we are going to be successful next time. For example, when I was 13 I had to take a test in order to get in to the high school that I wanted but, the test was hard and I failed the test i said I will not take it again because it is hard and I can't do it but my sister said that i can't give up and I have to take it again and again and finally I pass the test for the second time.

Moreover, it teaches us to be patient. when we fail it is the best thing for us to wait for the good time to start over and to get what we want. obviously, it will take time to start all over and do everything one by one but it will help us to learn how to be patient and to deal with problems better than before. Clearly we will get what we want sooner or later after trying hard.

Overall, failure is a key to success. We will not get to success if we do not fail once. It is not something to be ashamed of.

In conclusion, gaining experience is the gift of failing. We start working hard and not to give up. We learn to be patient and chase our dreams. The best thing we can do is to be happy and joyful even after failing. Everything has it's own time so be patient. ",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0
E2456BDC6648,"Conserving energy and resources by attending less days to school. Adopting a four-day school week and only adding two more hours; each day consisting of nine hours. It will help to reduce the consuming of energy and resources. As we go out everyday to complete our duties in the school's building, we consume energy from the sky lights and others useful lights, the computers, and laptops. Also the food students receive in school as a lunch. Plus students frequently purchase gas to come to school; due that some students need to come in their own cars or public buses, because they don't live around the school area. Additionally students that are currently having a part-time job will be able to work more. In the case of student who are not working in a part-time job would get one more day added to the weekend, and they would be able to spend more time doing family activities or having a good time with friends, and close people.

To start with, reducing the consume of energy will help with our planet; energy is produced with some elements and one of them and a very important one is: water. The less energy we use or waist the less will be the affect for our planet. Adopting the four-days school week will make all of us stay at home on Fridays and reduce the energy use from the school when using lights, computers and laptop that need to be charged.

Secondly, If students come to school only for four days, the food that they usually obtain on Fridays will be saved and use for the next Monday; that way saving food will start to be a good benefit for conserving resources. Also some students come to this school but they living in a different city not closely to school; they purchases gas every week and they have to spend money, Therefore if they only come for four days a week; they will saved gas for the weekends or for the next week of school. That's one of the best ways to conserve cars' energy and resources; due to that gas use petroleum to be produced and other substances and chemicals that come from our planet soil grounds or others areas.

Lastly, Students will obtain benefit by adopting this for-days school week as well, because the students that are currently working in a part-time job will obtain the opportunity to work a full day on Fridays, they will be able to increase their revenue. In the case for students that don't have a job, they will have extra time to do homework, projects, and family activities as well.

Even thought, they are students with a different point of view, when it comes to adopting a four-day school week. they argue that adding two more hours to the regular school day, will be more exhausted and they will have less hours to work in their part-time jobs.

In conclusion, Adopting a four-day school week will help to conserve energy and resources. Firstly: conserving energy light and food and saving gas and money, having extra time for work, friends and most important: Family.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5
E24A6E61B08D,"Have you ever ask yourself why do some people are always are their home never go out to socialize with others? Since technology appear in the world, the life of millions of people got a easier way to live, because it brought most of the things and supplies that we need to make our life better and easier.

In my opinion i think technology has positive effect in people's live specially in young people, because teens who are in school have more opportunities to learn a get the skills that they need for their future, they have access to computers at their school to get more information about their classwork and the benefit to take classes or tests online without even attending to school.

Technology allows you to communicate with others without having contact, you dont need to be face to face to communicate with others, it brings people the facilities for those who dont have time to go out to buy the things that they need online like clothes or grocery without going to the store, and the capability to invent things that humans cant do.

However technology has negatives effects too, have you ever seen a little kid playing with toys like before technology was invented, you can see kids of 5-10 years old that already have a phone or video game console , they are addicted to it but not only kids young people too, therefore people can lose their vision by using it to much but its not the fault of technology its our own responsibility to take care of our health.

I always try not to take care of what other people say they can talk whatever they want is their problem but when someone come's and they don't like that they can get hurt and there is when they look for you when they are in trouble, when i am angry or sad i just like to play soccer because that helps me to forget the problemsm that i got in my mind, if could it do something.

i would it try to make games of soccer so all the people that want to play soccer can get to do it and they can forgot their problems too. that's why sports are made because people can have fun without fight, and one more thing it can be is to go with friends to see movies or to watch soccer games or basket ball games or volleyball i don't know but there are a lot of ways to get to know someone, in my way i think that everything got a solution for the problems the problem is that we don't our respect to other people if we do it everthing it would be really different

Everything that we want is to be safe in a place where no gangstars are bbecause they only know how to make peolpe get more poor of what they are we should get involve all the families to try to destroy the people that are hurting others, alot of people try to study their best to be someone in their life they just want to get out their families out of trouble, out of bad ways, they can make alot of money easier when they finished ther school, only with high school finish you can get a nice job not a job that you would like it but you can get at least something.

People can be safe having their things like if someone try to take all that you had they just can go the police and tell them what happens and they might help them and they might help to try to recover what they lose people shouldn't be scared because when they show that they are scared other people can be smart and do a lot of things to thm just because they show sacared and all that we are people really smart but we sould be smart in everything because not because we are smart in some things it means that other people can be nice with you if you don't show angrily other people angry can hurt you in one way that it's going to hurt you a lot.

All people are nice but when they get angry or mad they change a lot they can be reall angry and you can be scared of how they can get, but for not having problems with someone you should just invite them to play sports somewhere or to have fun with your friends you'll can go to the beach and have a lot of fun there so the people can not get angry and it can get to be your friends forever or at least only friends, but no one should show their debil point because when you get a problem with your friends they would aready know what's the point that you would mostly hurt that's hy i think no one should know the most imporant debil point of your body or of you so this is my prompt thanks                                                   ",2.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5

E28221F47AE3,"Yesterday, I was talking with my parents and they tell me that I have to start thinking about what career I want after I graduate from high school. I start seeing what issues can cause and I think that it is bad idea to select what career I want at this age, because whats is going to happen if I don't like the career that I choose when I was younger or if that career is going to give me the money that I'm looking for and what about if my parents are not in conditions to help me pay the career that I want, after think all this I meet with my parents again and I tell them the reasons that why I don't want to select my career at this time.

The first reason that I think why is not a good idea to select my career at this age was, what is going to happen if I select one career but after four or five years later I like other career and I really want to be in the other that its totally different from the one that I select five years before, maybe they are going to get mad at me because they are going to say that am just wasting my time or something like that and I don't want that I want to be sure about the career that i get is going to really like me when I get older.

The second reason was, who know's that is that career is going to help me in my economy because some career with the time they lose demand on the thing that they are doing and they give you fire or reduce your salary, but if I take my time to think and analyze all the careers that i like that can be better, because everyone wants a job that can provide a good salary and a good benefits and thats what I want, in that way everything is going to be more secure for me that nothing of that issues that I said before is going to happen and my economy stays in good conditions.

And the third reason that I think was, what about if I select my career and my parents after the four years that we have to do in high school they don't have the opportunity to help me pay my career and I ready get very excited that's is going to get me very nervous because i didn't think about what other career I want to do. This is why I want more time to think about it and see if my parents can help me to pay the career that I choose, in this way me and my parents don't get frustrated, I for having multiple choices of what careers I like and my parents for paying something that they can afford with their money.

In conclusion, I think that it is a really bad idea to let young kids decide what career they want because not all the time it is going to like the same career that we choose when we were younger or what about if after high school you decide to no continued in school because you have to work because your parents need help for paying some stuffs or because you want to buy your own things or just you don't like school anymore, so in my opinion I think it's very important to have a lot of time for choose whatever you want to do after you graduate from high school.

E2F31005AF32,"Only topic that is frequenthy is debate today is whether or not conserve energy and resouces since some business have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? Some peolpe think that not only extending the school day should conserve energy and resource. They feel that is the same thing and also too that is more time in the school in addiction that they will spent more money in energy like electricity, ligths , charge to computers ,blackboard electric and the more things, an resource that should spent more is the water because some students when go to the bathroom they forget closed the washstand. I believe that should follow this model by extending the school day two hours because should be take care about of how to conserve energy, resources and the last but not the least is we will have more time for make a the world better and take consience.

One reason i believe why that should follow this model by extending the school day two hours is because we can conserve more energy for the future, and also too the school should instruct to each student to be careful about the how to consume energy, for example to teach wich focus is the correct for the use in the home and gives tips for that maybe they to pay the least possible bill of light.

Another reason is that i feel that a resource that we can save in the school is the water because all students use almost two time the bathroom and always to take down the pull of the toile, i think the students can make posters in where show the importance about how to save the water and others resources that in the school can save is the plastic and paper because in some places purchase this resources, and with the money the school should to be a better school than others and the students should be more careful about this rescources.

The final reason is that i believe if the school add two hours at the day students and teachers should will have more time for to do more thigs, a thing that the teachers and students will can do is maybe a propaganda, in this propaganda they can show the society how prevent the clime global and to instruct how to be careful with of world, other thing that the students can do is a page online in where to instruct the other students and people out school how make herself have to be careful.

As you have read i think that the school should add two hours per day becuase all peolpe in the school can have more conscience for to save the energy and resource the last but not the leas the world.

Some peoples are in the street because they do not think on there benefit. sometimes be had opportunity to grow but we lose it.

The job can help to much and pay to much money if we are good with the work and do everything how the boss want to everybody do.

Whenever, you want to do to grow not do more or want more then other or you not do nothing, not startle do more of the other, the people who want grow more then other for them never are something benefit or desire what other had that is not good. its for this the author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ''Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow''.

I think that a science experiment could be enjoyable because you can learn new things with your friends,you can work on the experiment with you friends,and you can talk to other people about what you got or learned

First,i think that science experiments could be enjoyable because you can learn new things with your friends. Sometimes your friends won't figure out things as fast as you or they might not figure it out,so you can explain to them how you figured it out and maybe they figured out something you havent yet so they might teach you about what they got to. Later on in the school year you might be asked on a test or quiz about the thing that you learned. When you get home and your parents ask you what you learned you can tell them and explain it to them.

Second,i think that science experiments could be enjoyable because you can do the science experiment with your friends. If you do it with your friends you can have fun. You could have time to talk to them about the science experiment that your doing, Also you could work together on it and get a good grade.

Lastly,i think that science experiment could be enjoyable because you can talk to other people outside of your group about what you got and learned. Lets say that you went to another group to see what they figured out and they tell you something you dont agree with,so you could explain to him or her about what you got and how you got it and then you can ask the teacher and figure out who was wrong. You can learn from what they got and add it to your work.

Students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because I once had a friend who attended classes from home she never did what she was suppose to do she took that as an advantage to do other things that she needed to do she didn't benefit at all. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they take advantage of it, they don't do what their suppose to do, and they don't learn nothing.

First of all, student take the advantage of attending classes from home to do other things that they need to do. For example turning in stuff late that were long due, not all student that attend classes from home take it as an advantage but those who do they just take more advantage just to have fun and not do the work that they are suppose to be doing. Another thing is they will always try to come up with an excuse of why they didn't do the assignment that they were suppose to do. They take advantage of the time they have to go out with friends to party, to hang out with their boyfriend, and to do other things that are non-school related.

Most importantly, they don't do what their suppose to do, when they get an assignment or project that their suppose to do they just act lazy and not do it cause they know nobody for example, like their teacher wont be telling them to do the work. They will spend most of their time doing other stuff instead of the work that they need to be done with. Students will spend more time partying, hanging with their friends instead of actually doing the work that they need to do which will actually help them later on. Most students actually know the stuff they just preferred not to do any of the work cause they don't feel like doing it.

Finally, The students actually don't learn nothing by attending classes from home all they do is just party, hang out with their friends and boyfriend. They actually don't do any of the work that they are assign to do they just cheat by copying it off of someone or get the answers from the internet. Most student they attend classes from home as an opportunity to have fun and to take a break from school, they literally will learn nothing cause all they do is play around when they are suppose to take things seriously they just want to party all day long and not care about any of the stuff that they are suppose to be studying.

In closing, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they take advantage of it to do other things that they need to do, they don't do what their suppose to do they don't do their work as suppose to do, and they don't learn nothing all they do is party, hang out with their friends and boyfriend they don't do none of the things that they are assign to do.

E3D9EE7C68F1,"Have you ever wonder how many enjoyable activities are outside of the world? They're thousands of enjoyable activities outside the world. Most people like to spend time with their families outdoors such as going to community parks, state parks, and national parks. Not everyone likes to go outside to spend time with their family, or go to a place to have fun because they don't like to go outside that much, but most of the times you need to go and look around what's around the world. I would prefer someone should go to and spend time with their family, or just to have fun such as going to the zoo, going to Disney or travel to a different state where you live.

The first reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go to the zoo. Most zoo's can be a little boring, but you can find a way to have lots of fun. The zoo can bring you lots of fun, and enjoyment such as taking pictures with the animals, giving the animals their food, and touching and giving love to the animals that are in the zoo. For example, at the zoo you can learn some interesting facts about every kind of animal that are you very interest in. Also, giving lots of love to the animals like talking to them or touching them is a way to be relax. You can learn new things about animals and the history, and it can be interesting and fun at the same time. In my opinion, the zoo is a great place and a great activity to have fun.

The second reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go to like a Disney park.

A large of number of people that I have known go to Disney to have fun with their family members. For example, at a Disney park you can go and try different games there, eat some different type of food that you haven't tried yet, and go and take picture of princesses that you really want to meet. For example, if you watch Disney princesses, you can go and meet them in real life, and talk to them. Also, going to Disney and trying games or riding any type of game is going to bring you enjoyment. It will take you the stress that you have, and you will forget everything that you been going through. In my opinion, Disney is the second best place to go and have fun by yourself or with the people that is around you.

The third reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go and travel to a different state, or country that they have never been to. For example, going to the Bahamas is a great place to go, looking at museums of what had happened in that place. Also, going to the beach in the Bahamas is another way to have fun, the beach is going to relax you in a type of way that you will not imagine. Exploring the world, or trying new things from a different state or country is a type of having fun, You can got to different parks, different beaches, and different restaurants where you can try different type of foods that you haven't even tried and that are the bets. In my opinion, going to different countries, or different states that you have never been is the third reason why it's a great idea to go and have lots of fun.

Many people like to have fun in different ways not just being outside. Most people like to spend time alone or with their family members. There's different types of way to have fun at different places not only going to the zoo, going to Disney a park, or going to a place that you have never been or explore what is it like to be in another country. Find a way to have some fun outdoors and all the things that keeps you stress are going get away in a second. Spending time in something that you really love is a great feeling that you will have experience in your life. Have fun with all the people that you love and that is around you because spending time with them and going to parks with them is the best feeling that you ever will ever have.

E3E6D43F34B2,"Should our school extend the school day two hours? No, I strongly disagree with extending two hours to school day. By extending two hours of school day, students for sure need to take a rest, take a shower, some students need to do chores, and also focus on their goals after school. If we extend two hours of school day, then students would not be able to focus on their education, because the brain cells need a break and need to refresh itself. Furthermore, if there is 4 days of school and 3 days of no school, then students will forget what they studied 3 days ago.

In Afghanistan, schools adopted a four-day school week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Therefore, we are comparing the grades and attendance of students. With extending two hours of school day, this system had effect students educational life. Students are not showing up to school and they skip school because of the new system. This idea had discrease the number of attendance and the grades of most of the students.

I think that students have reason of thougtht that is this is an achievement not is easy we have a achievement yes we have a achievement in this life because yes not have an achievement I do know that you thought in my opinion the trues is the point number firts in this life because that is really happened the true is import always me question for me is that yes not have true all away different.

Some things of this paragraph elieve o this prompt is that understand that the students they believe that students must be self confident and that sense have this world power CONFIDENT are two world confident and confidence Confident is feeling or showing that your are sure about your own abilities opcions and confidence is trust or stong belief in someone or something. I have every confidence in ability to do the job. They have much confident and they have much order to learn more order is to tell someone to do something in a strong way which does not permit him to refuse and without saying they ordered to learn more learn is to get knowledge a skill they learning work they thounght that are the best.

They have achievenment something that is done successfully espeacially through hard work or skill. The act of finishing something successfully the feeling that you get when you have finished something sucessfully. They in learning by lowering to move someone or something down to make something less in amount or quality.

What is an future? an future is at or to a greater distance in time more to a greater degree the board needs time to consider the matter futher. I can't remember any futher back than 1995 at or to a greater distance in space. However many people also use futher when talking about distances especially in formal coversation only futher can be used in other senses we need a futher week to finish the project but make your life no have self rich with only proffession make your future preofession a type of job that needs special training or skill especially one that needs a high level of education and yes have one occupation is always a job or profession always a employment is a work specially when it is done to earn money it's very difficult to find work at the moment.

I think that yes have a carrer like the student best effort but work I think that I can always but have a carrer the job or series of jobs that someone has in a particular are of work usually involving more resposibility as time passes I have a friend she had a very distingushed carrer in medicine she have a profession I do know because is different a prefession with carrer or trade I think that a trade is a hob always but specially one that involves working with your hands and requieres special training but now talking of the students I think that not have a job because thought that they not have a experience in a job.

I do know that must talking of this only think in the job and the student that the other people thought that they no have experience and that is esperience is to have somehing happen to you to feel something it was the firts time I had ever experenced failure and experinced is having the knowledge or skill that is necessary for something the true this student put in me an expiration because the point important this but they is the true they have a good point the sincerity the quality of being sincere or honest sincere used about a person really meaning or believing what you say not pretending sincerely in a way that shows what you really feel or think about someone or something.

The student's have praising like you say when you are expressing admiration for someone or somethig I think that they have a precaution always precaution in the job I think precaution is something that you do now in order to avoid danger or problems in the future. We took the precaution of locking our valuables in the things with safe like precautions against fire. The students I think that they thought in implore when you implore someone when the situation is very serious and you need something very much.

They had importance about the job the decision was of great importance to the future of the business they have importance of this job only person not have tolerance but learning other people what is tolerance is like to allow accept someone or something especially opinions or behavior that you do not agree with or people who are not like you and other word is intolerance the ability to suffer something especially pain difficukt conditions the student only working together but self better so that two or more things are mixed with joined.

The other people no have compassion they no are considerable with students I think that they had considerable difficullty in getting the students they have a opinion are work the important is the true they must consider the matter carefully before they make our choice to have something in my opinion I think about someone or something in a particular way. They need considered that not are riks wastoo great to remember or pay attention to something the like the students is they have repect not are angry for no have experience in the job they are intelligent for no have insecurity is this I like not have insecure not are they have security Ilike they",2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5
E4FF635779B8,"People say working in groups is better than working alone, but thats their opinion even though it helps others more than it helps other individual's. I still know working alone is better because all my life i've been working alone since sixth grade. I wasnt really the person to just jump in and meet others or ask for help when i needed them.

Every person has to go through many difficult times looking for a group but, Their just too shy or too nervous to say a word to other people, I would know because i was in the same problem. It can be hard but, the reward is so worth it.

People say working alone has no distractions, finishing faster than others, or learning things on our own. Other individual's say that having no distractions can help them work without stopping but, sometimes there are many difficult situations where we cant do much to work while being distracted, maybe being in quiet place may help. Finishing our work can easily be done without a group, like in our jobs, an office, or even at school. Not everyone has a group to be in except for people that know each other , They have many people that wish to be in a group like them. Back then when i was a little boy, I didnt know English so it was harder for me to understand teachers, or even students till i met two other kids that spoke the same language as me. I was happy to actually find two people that speak the same language as me but, that didnt last long because i never got to see them again. Till then i worked alone, avoiding others, sticking close to myself, even studying alone without anybody. My mother or father couldnt help me as much. That made things worse for me. Thats how i learned to do things all on my own without help. In a quiet place, We'er able to finish other assighment's from our jobs or school work. Teachers and students love to be in a quiet place because it helps them concentrate more than being in a group.

In conclusion working alone is better than working in groups. next time try working on alone, in a quiet room. ",3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0

France was a romantic and beautiful place to go. And the food there is amazing in France they also have a really good accent. But the main reason i want to go to France is because of the thing to see their stuff like the ifle tower. the other reason is to meet other people so in that case i would have to travel on a day theres going to be a lot of people.

The reason I would go to France is to have the knowledge to be able to tell someone about how it changes you and how it's like and different temperature like how the country is to going to change on bad temperature their might just a small amount of people outside. On a good day there is going to a people are walking around having fun. You also try to see if the people their nice or mean to other people.

If I ever had a choice to go to France I would say yes and when I get the first thing i would try is there food. Because a lot of people said that the food in France is delicious so I thought what if i try to get my own opinion. To me it feels good to be apart of something it doesn't feel good to be the third wheel just staying back watching them give there feedback but have no clue what they'er talking about.

The animals in France are not that dangerous and the cats and dogs are exreamly cute. Like chuwawas are so cute and the most known animals in France at lest that what i have seen on television. Most people in France like animals and chuwawas design which makes them look better.

E6346D434004,"It is a most important thing to be yourself. At first pass, it would seem to be obvious that you would aspire to be yourself. But we all know of the pressures to please others as we grow up. First the pressure comes from your parents, then your young peers, on to teachers and bosses. You find yourself constantly trying to live up to the expectations of others and why not? It is usually a good things to follow the wishes of those who have raised you, and it is natural to conform to the ways of people who help you along the way. it is alot like osmosis. It is also expected that prescribed pathways are followed, in a way, to repay kindness and debts. As an example, parents pay for your education, including arts and sports activities so surely it makes sense that you would try to excel in those endeavours as a form of Thank you. The same goes for showing a good teacher or mentor that you understand their lesson and often end up developing further on the path they revealed and recommended.

However, at some point your own predictions and dreams emerge. Let them and pay attention to them as they will become your guide to your ultimate destiny. While showing respect for your parents and elders, start to forge your own identity. Those who truly love you will be on the sidelines cheering your every step. Consider he words of Dr. Seuss, ""Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't care''. I couldn't have said it any better.

Essentially, and ultimately, you don't have any choice in the decision about being yourself. Since the time of Socrates, and no doubt before, a predominant human instinct has been to know thyself. The problem for some people however is that they harbour the inner self and keep it separate from the self they display to the world. This predicament can eventually morph into a personality disorder if the gap between your inner person and public persona is too wide. Soon being in public will become a chore you will feel like a phony. you will probably end up living the life of the recluse. Not a good result for most people except the odd monk.

The best way to allow your inner self, that part of you that holds your real aspirations and dreams, to become what the world sees is to start cultivating the key aspects of those chracter traits. Start becoming that person in your mind and begin to feel this is yourtrue self soon actions will follow. You will begin to feel comfortable in your own skin. For example, if you want to become a musician then slowly tell people that you ""are planning a career in music"" and start acting that way. Surprisingly, this will start you help you as other people will begin to look at you in that light. Eventually they will tell others who are interested in the same path. Soon that will led to communications between you and a host of other like-minded people. Your network will expand and you will soon be part of a musically inclined community nurtured and growing professionally all the while gaining confidence in the new you.

Another way to look at ''finding'' yourself involves a more prosctive, less reflective path. Life is not about finding yourself ; Life is about creating yourself"".

This is the other side of the coin. Maybe our ""selves"" are like a blank slate waiting for someone to write the future. Maybe we should not dwell too much on ourselves. Too much soul searching can lead to a sort of paralysis an inertia brought on by excessive searching for the meaning.

I think we all instinctively know what we want to do it is just some of us are a little hesitant to breakout. But, it is the only way you will reduce anxiety and eventually find a sense of fulfillment. So just do it as the Nike ads encourage. Step into that real you and have some fun along the way. Be Yourself. Everyone else is taken. So, we need to keep this things into our selves that way we could improve our selves as the best human being in the world. No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.

So, I totally agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson that ""To be yourself in a world is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5
E71DABB44645,"This essay has been written to take in consideration the advantages and disavantages of a four-day school week with each day considering to be ten hours which for some people it might seems to be a better way to conserve energy and resources.

As a student I can say that I agree with this ""benefit"" but in this case I don't agree with making school two hours longer than usual for some students spending eight hours in school is consider to be enough becuase people get exhausted by spending most of the day sitting in a classroom. For example: in every classroom there is someone who is always sleeping during class due to the a lot of work school leave us to do, people who has work after school, and even sports. These reasons of why people gets to be too tired to stay up during class, imagine having to spend two additional hours in school just to have a three day weekend which might seems good but it really doesn't.

Spending two hours more than usual for four days it just a way to still using energy even though people think they are saving energy but they really are not doing any better, let's use this as a example: the two hours we are using extra for the four day it still makes up for the eight hours we are losing for the fifth day of class. The extra two hours of Monday-Thursday sum to be eight hours that people still use the energy, which means they aren't really saving energy

Example number 1: my friend Generic_Name loves the idea to have a four day school because this means that he will have a extra day to do homework and to spend time with his girlfriend Generic_Name. For him this new programs works perfectly and is an advantage for him.

Example number 2: My boyfriend Generic_Name loves to study but he does not agree with this new idea because he has sports to do after school for like about 2 hours of training for the basketball team in our school and then after that he works for 4 hours to help his mom with his car insurance which means that he won't get enough to sleep at night because after he gets home from work he has to do homework so we won't have to turn in it late. Like him there is a lot of more students in the same situation. Who does thing sacrifies to help their parents to make the payments.

However, teacher's opinion matter too and they will be tired of speaking ten straight hours too, remember that they aren't robots who are just set up by the government. This means that they might not even agree with this new idea of making school loger for students and teachers.

My school should not follow this model because they should think in everybody's benefits including teachers and students plus the staff of every department in the school's main office to make a fair decision for everyone in school. We don't know if this new adaptation will work in the schooling system which we don't have guarantee of this idea working well for us as a community. Consideranting that this program is working for some business that have adopted this new schedule might not work for us as a High School because here we have differents actitvities that the people in businees companies doesn't have, which make us a different environment than the business.

Sometimes life could be misleading and maybe will be hard to find yourself or your proposit.

E7EBDBDD703F,"Do curfews keep teenagers from getting into trouble? The city council is still currently debating on either adopting the curfew to be at 10 p. m. during the week days or at midnight on the weekends. If teenagers were to be out after the hours selected, it would be considered breaking the law. The laws are choosen for many reasons, even if we don't agree with most of them; we have to obey the laws. I believe the city council should adopt the cerfew for the minnors. When it comes to under age people in this world we have to be more conserned for their safety, it is best to have curfews. We should consider all the dangerous things going on in this world.

Have you considered all the things that could happen when your child is out? There is many dangerous things going on in this world. I'm not saying something will happen but honestly nowadays anything could happen. Without an adults care vision many things could occur. Many minnors are being killed or harmed for reasons we don't know. A curfew is one way from preventing those things from happening to your children. Even though a curfew at midnight on a weekend could still be dangerous; it is our responsability to teach the minnors from right to wrong. If we get them to understand why it is important to have a curfew they would be exrta careful. Theres a high possability they won't want to listen about their curfew; I can speak for myself I would want to spend more time with my friends there was a few times I didn't listen to my mom. I relized how much my safety ment to my mother and how worried she would be when i would be out late.

Have you heard about what happened to Generic_Name in New York? He was such a good child. His mother talk about how he loved hanging out with his nephews and family. She said he wouldn't go out with friends, he would always be home. He was very close to his sister, they'd always be together. Generic_Name had good grades in school, he would never get into trouble at all. The reason I bring his story life into this essay is because he was killed a few blocks away from is house, outside a little food market. I'm not so sure about the time but it was after dark. It was a group of guys who saw him, dragged him out the market and stabbed him under his arm. He tryed asking for help but no one would help him; he tryed getting to a hospital by foot unfortunaly Generic_Name didn't make it and died on the sidewalk. Those guy were caught a few months later and said they confused him with another guy. Generic_Name had no fault in any of it,he didn't deserve it. Maybe if he would of wanted for the next day or if his mom would of took him things could of happened diffrently. My point is leaving your house alone isn't so safe, when your with your parents it goes completey different.

Some people might think they would give the freedom they wanted as a child to there children. They might think there isn't a problem with them going out when ever they'd like and don't think they need a curfew. Everyone wants to enjoy their life and live it fully. Enjoying life doen't have to be passed your curfew, theres more to see during the day. Yes, you might trust your child so much you believe it's okay for them to leave but do you believe in the other people with your child being out in pulic? During day is much more safe then at night time when it's dark. One reason being is because of how many peolpe are out during the day. You could scream for help, run or give signs of being in danger. At night everyone is sleeping, and barely anyone is around.

In conclusion, the city council should think about the things going on in this world and do what's best for the teenagers, which is to have a curfew. Teenagers can still have their freedom and enjoy every bit of their lifes with curfews. I think it would be for the best; everyone would be safe in that way. Mostly everyone can agree that their minnors safety is important. Curfews would also keep teenagers from getting into trouble.     ",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5
E883A8265183,"Is working with a group is Benefits? In my opinion working with a group is better then working by yourself,becuase when we work as a group we can finish our work faster then working alone furthermore in group work you can make new friends,you can learn how to work as a team because in group work you have to make sure you are being nice to your team mates and you must listen to everyone else point of viewe in group work people you learn how to respect others.

Working with a group have more benefits then woking alone becuase if you have a big project to do and your teacher allows you to work as an group but you choose not to join any group and decide to work alone so this will be hard for you to complete the project on time and the people who join the group can easily complete the project before you because they can help each other this is the biggiest benefit of working with a group.

In group work all the members of the group have to do equal work and this way they can do their part of the project very easily and if they work alone they are not abel to work that well because they have no one else to gave them advice or any kind of help therefore group work is always benefit.

Some people might think that group work should not be allow but in my opinion group work is the best way to study becuase this way you learn about how to be nice to some one and how to be responsibel for your work becuase in team work you always have to do some part of the work which your team memebers told you to do and you all can share your thoughts about your work and can get better grade on the project Group work always gives you benefits.",2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0

I think that if you are not honest you shouldn't be trusted by anyone. you give all of your trust to that person and you say don't tell anyone, if that person does it anyways are you going to trust them again, I wouldn't. if you want to be trusted you need to start from zore. so stop lieing to ever one you trust and be honest and tell the truth to every one. and be nice and don't get in trouble. if people believe on you they're going to have your back no matter what.

Failure is inavoidable the path to success is not straight one.

everyone fails sometime in their life .

Walt disney was fired for a newspaper because he lacked creativity.

Learn from your mistakes, if you make a mistake at least you know not to do it again.

A failure might put an end to one thing (idea or opportunity) but lead you to other for example: I used to try to draw realistic people and animals with pensils, and then I found that i was better at zentangle (an art style that consists of repetitive designs and patterns. The success you end up having might not be the kind you originally had in mind. Failures could lead you into in something else entirely.

Failure often leads to problem, working to solve problems and getting through difficult times makes you smarter and stronger as a person. By dealing with your failures, you will be more prepared and experienced in the fututre. Strength, intelligente, problem solving skills, and experience are all thing that are gained from faiture and can lead to success.

Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that success consists of going from faiture to faiture without loss of enthusiasm. I think that faiture Plays a crucial role during the pursuit of success.

If there were not mistakes in life. Then no one would learn from then. Faiture is unavoidable, but it can be a useful tool that helps shape your future.

My conclusion is Faiture can change who you are and what path you're on in life, and I believe that it plays an important role in the persuit for success.

Mistake only makes us smarter and working to solve problems only makes us stronger.

Without faiture, no one would be sucessful.

EA40087521CC,"Failure is a dreaded thing in our daily life what we try to avoid. A lot of people trying to not get in any situation where they can fail, and just a lesser layer of the people want to face with them. Those people find it as a learning process and they a make great outcomes from they life.

Fear controlls every aspect of our life. How do we looks like? Did we made the right decission? In most cases we fear about failure because we are not sure about the success or a positive outcome of the situation and the consequences of our actions. This idea divide peoples minds to two sides, two ideology: shy, safety player and brave, risk taker. Both sides have pros and cons.

Those who chose the safety game, are using they background knowledge what they learned for long years and made it highly sure to not fail it. The word shy is not the best representation for them just in that case when something new and unknown came in to learn. They don't take the risk to fail it and they obviously will not fail because they will not even try. That can be any situation like answer the question in class; try out a sport; go to the gym; wear a new cloth; ect. The only thing what is make a gate between them and to try it is the fear. They don't take the risk and they will never know the outcome. If it's a fail then they take it as a lose. Maybe the only thing what is a benefit in their thinking they will really not going to lose anything but then the successes will come lesser. Also that doesn't mean they are not risk takers or they live in constant fear, it's just more safer. The cases where they are need to take steps can be not that scarry or it's doesn't need to be a big deal. These type of people are already made mistakes and the reason why then fear to try it again the previous experiences. Said something dumb in class and everyone laughted; tried a sport be he/she was not succes at all; in the gym he/she felt unconfortable because he/she was not that strong like the people around them, ect.

On the other side those people who trying out new thigs and got experience are usually the ones who make something in their lives what will stand for them after time. Great example for this is the former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill itself. His life shows the importance of trying. If we just think about how he becamed a Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, it's easy to realize it was not always easy for him. Biography of his life tells us how many times he tried and failed but even through he gained success. People like Churchill are thinkers and they take the failures as a lessons of the life. For them is a learning process of making an idea perfect; make an action successful; decide a the right way; answer a question rightfully. If a fail cames up after a wrong move they face with it and they are most importantly proud of it. Not proud about what they failed, about the correction, the knowledge what they gained and driving them to avoid the same and similar fails. Yes they can make the same mistake again but at the end they will be the winners. And this is the point where the enthusiasm came in.

People are trying to reach their goals and enthusiasm drives them. Winston Churchill won the World War II because his goal was to not fail his people, the mankind, and everything what he built. Enthusiasm can have different faces like duty as a president, joy like an istrument player, or to bring happyness like a parent. To keep the enthusiasm is depending on the person. The goal what is requires it can be lesser, greater, midling, makes no difference. The person who keeping it is matters, not the size of the goal because anyone can be a president if he/she really wants it but cannot go to the gym a few times a week if he/she is lazy and don't have enough willingness in their heart. That is a close connection with our life goals. Doesn't matters if it's short or long tearm goals. That enthusiasm can broke after fails or can be even stronger than before.

My example is with the martial art also an example for this. I learned how to dual wield the nunchaku and the learning process was painfull. I'm right handed and to learn, just to spin it, with my left hand hurted me. I was hitting my forearm thousand times. My skin was red after an hour of practice. People asked me why do I still trying and why do I don't stay down. The reason why I didn't stoped was my enthusiasm in my goal to master the nunchaku. After months of practice I did it successfully and in these days I'm not a master yet but at least I cannot hit myself.

A lot of people who going to failure to failure are also taking a risk to fail to the point where they can't try it again. That means a fail where a people can die. These are specific cases but not just death can stop us. Also there are situations where a person just become unable to do thing what he/she did before. And yes there also situations after tragedies where we can stand up stronger than before. There was a boy who loved to ride his bicycle and do tricks with it. One day he had an accident with it in a car crash and he lost his leg. He was in wheelchair for months but doctors offered him a chance to make him a plastic leg. He spent a lot of time in recovery and when he was able to move by himself he wanted to return to his dream. For a lot of time he failed to do anything with his bike. He was angry and broken. But he didn't gave up. After failing again and again he finally on his bike again. In these day he riding like before the accident because he never give up. His strory is inspire me.

I agree with Winston Churchill. We need to fail to learn and enyoj what we reach. We need to try and train not till we can get it right, till we can't get it wrong. And we need a goal to be enthusiastic and to never lose it, to make it stronger after every fail. We can stay in our comfort zones and try to avoid the fails or we can face with them and get experience. ",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5
EA42A6028804,"People argue whether or not its a good idea for students to study or identify a carrier of their choice when entering high school. I agree that students should commit to a career of choice when entering high school because they'll be ahead in life than many other students who dont get the opportunity to chose a career they want to learn in high school and studying their choice of career at a younger age would have them college ready.

Learning a specific carrier at the time when entering high school is very beneficial to students because it would have students who do chose to learn a carrier would have them very much ahead of students who their high school's dont even offer the opportunitie to learn a carrier during their years of high school. Learning and mastering a career of choice is something that students should take for granted because once mastered it can lead u to many opportunities while your in high school or have graduated. These opportunities can lead you to Paid internship programs, college scholarships, and even a Job right after high school.

Students who get to study a career of choice during their high school career would prepare them for college. Having students identify a career during there high school years would give them a better feel to go to college right after high school. Your resume would look much more achievable when colleges see you have earned a certificate for mastering a career you choose to learn during your time in high school. Learning something you want to do in the future would prepare you for college because it would almost be the same as attending a college, but without all the nice technology or lab equipment colleges or universities have.

Others would disagree when i say that students should identify a career of choice when entering high school and I understand why. While some parents would want there child to study a career earlier in life, other would recommend that they shouldnt be pressured in to choosing some sort of career when entering high school because it can be really stressful for the students to already having to chose a career to pick right after middle school and other parents want there kid to enjoy life as teenager and then worry about that later. The first reason I understand, but picking a career of choice is super beneficial to that student because studying it and then getting a certificate to when passed the class will lead you to many opportunities during your years in high school and would put you ahead of many others.

This is why I believe students should identify a career when entering high school. It puts them ahead of the game and prepares them for college and the future. I also believe that we should have every high school in the United States offer some sort of options of careers that students can take during there high school career and that the schools can teach in all high schools around America.

EA5B3C8E09D1,"I agree with this statement because, positivity is the key to success, if your always being negative and saying negative stuff it will be hard for you to find success. My dad once told me that whatever you do in life and even if you fail you should always tackle it with a postive attitude no matter what. Having a positive attitude has great benefits when it comes to work place,your personal business and even life in general, being rude or disrespectful to people won't pay, there is a saying that says what goes around comes around, so if you treat people with a negative attitude, in the near future somebody will treat you the same way. Attitude is very important in life, attitude determines if your going to be a better person in life or a bad person, attitude determines how well you are in treating people with respect. A good attitude goes a long way, even if you don't have enough money or you struggle to pay your bills having a good attitude and being postive will land you into a good job and also by meeting great people. Having a bad attitude can even ruin things that you know how to do well, if your suppose to be doing something and you do it with a bad attitude it won't turn out good, you will always end up doing something wrong because of your attitude. At the end of the day attitude counts, treating people with respect is very important and it will take you places you have never thought about.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0
EA8BE9778AA9,"On a human, the brain is the strongest part of their body. It control your body. Also, world's one of the biggest thing from a human brain is imagination. More than 100 years ago, people used their mind to build machines, planes, rockets, television , bridges, etc. Most of the things were build my their own imagination. Our world's one of the brilliant scientist of all time Albert Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I think that imagination is more important than knowledge in a lot of ways.

""Imagination""

is the power of mind to make something creative. Sometimes when you imagine something that you know you will do it no matter who stops you, It may come to real life and change the whole world. It can change a lot of thing in the world that you didn't thought of. For example: think that you designed a machine from your imagination about a robot maid who can help you to clean your house , do your laundry, make you dinner, washing the dishes, etc. From your idea, you made the robot and It worked just the you wanted it to work. And then your robot went to the market and the people brought it and loved the machine. How would you feel when you see your robot went viral in the world and people liking it? Your robot machine went from an a imaging thing to a big successful robot machine.

Also It helps your mind get stronger. When you thinking about anything, your brain is running from one place to another place to get the next task. In a human brain, we do 5% conscious and 95% unconscious things everyday. You are learning something new everyday, your brain collecting data based what you do in a everyday life basis. When you imaging something, your brain brings back the data from your past and puts it in your imagination. In that way,you know what you should in your imaginary work. Also, In that way your brain are becoming more conscious by your little thinking process and it's making your brain stronger everyday.

Imaginary can make you an open minded person. If you are good at imaging, when you are gonna talk to other people and they tries to explain you their situation, First, you will imagine yourself into that situation. Second, you will understand what they have been went through. Then you will think what should I do to make that person feel better. Next, you will give them some helpful advises that will make them better. If they feel safe around you, they will be more comfortable to tell more about them in future.

In conclusion, I think imagination is better than knowledge. It makes you a good person, It makes you open minded, It helps your brain to get stronger. And that way you will be able to help others'    ",3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0
EB03C897F7E8,"Student and teachers are have opposing views on working together for various reasons. However, according to new Stanford research, when people are treated as partners working together their motivation, student are able to communicate with each other, therefore creating a better final product. Working in team also prepares students for future careers and job. Whoever they will be required to learn to cope with other people and personalities, it is valued by employers. Even though students are not agree with each other all the time, working together is ore beneficial than working alone.

Every body ha heard someone in their life say "" two minds are better than one"" before right, this quote has never range more, and all of the idea it promotes reflect crystal clear off of group work. Working in a group can be drastically reduce the amount of work you need to do as well as make thing of more efferent, whether it be a group project paperer presentation. Because it cuts down on how much work one person has to do. It allows for group to achieve more as alone. Things are also finished much quicker because of the way many people can split up different jobs in a group an people with different skill sets can do what they are best at and do not have to worry about what they are bad at, this broader range of skill can also be used to help other people members develop their own by learning from their team members. The diversity found within a group of people is one of most powerful resources a person can have when it comes to finishing a task.

it lends a group of people to have many more ideas to come up with and bounce off of because many people are working

""The best way to have good idea is to have a lot of the a quote from Linus Pauting dealing with dilemma new idea's. When dealing with abdicating an idea from thin air, it be best to have multiple people instant of one because it brings multiple ideas all have fair and different point rather than multiple ideas no opposition or diversity.

Another benefit of having multiple people working in one group is that this can cause an evolutionary like phenomenon with multiple, stronger idea that complete and mulute, creating one in tribute and exceptional idea. This also comes with the help of a group, as a group can decide which idea would be main idea and smoothe out the edyes.

Another problem that can come up is well problem. Having a group of people can become extremely helpful for solving a problem that may come up in situations where a problem can arise, having a group of people can allow for quick and easy way to get out of a situation. Now working in a group does not have its advantage but some things are best done alone

Though working in a group can seem to be good working alone can be better depending on the situation. Being in group full of adult and unfocused group members is infuriating and may seem like torture. Although, some people prefer working alone because they can focus better and make decision faster, in the end, it is a better to working in a group.

if one does not do work the only they fail. Also being in a group fell safe. While being alone means you are much more impotent so working in group

Though working alone can be better for one reason such as anxiety. paranoia worry about other preference, or simply because they would prefer to work alone. Working in a team is advantage over some others who are unaccustomed to doing so , it helps develop people skill decision making skills and general expertise for putting up with others.

working in a group is also good for getting other people's opinion on group member work, as long as they do their part, oftentimes students will learn and experience more in a group of their peers than working alone which is definitely better for their future an possibly what lies ahead. Developing these skill will most likely help in the coming times of college, careers their future family and even retirement.

Overall, working together is beneficial because it creates less work and allow work to be completed faster. Working together promotes constructive criticism from other member of the group , which produces a better final product, working together create different points of view with different points of view new ideas are generated. New idea create diversity is the way to success.",3.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0
EBD07D2D103C,"I oppose the idea of schools offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes,this is because not all students benefit from attending classes from home,and online.

Giving students the choice to attend classes online is a big responsibility; Causing the demand that they must follow instructions,and complete class work tasks. It is true that most students have no problem with this , they complete their agenda and assignments; Thus why they are more comfortable with this method of learning. But this method of learning is not always the case for some students, because it gives this students an opportunity to become nonchalant about their classes; Consequently, they start to fool around and get distracted at times. Attitudes like this can lead to: not meeting up with deadlines, missing daily classworks, poor understanding skills, and ultimately failure. Students that have poor learning skills would be incompetant to take online classes, Which mean at all costs their must be guidance for this kind of students. It is possible that due to a lack of connection with the Teacher in the classroom and the student, it is most likely they would not have the chance to ask further questions or recieve reliable advices from a teacher. In some cases students can benefit from seeking assurance from other students with more knowlegde about the subject, group activites ,and asistance.

In conclusion, distance learning and it's method of teaching is not helpful to every student, because a stystem of learning that benefits all students,and give students opportunity for futher understanding is more beneficial.",3.0,2.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5
EBEFF43F46EE,"If you could accomplish one thing in the future, what would you choose? Something I would like to accomplish in the future would be attending and graduating college because it will make me feel successful, it will help me learn what I need in order to get my dream job, and I wanna be able to be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college.

The first reason why I would like to accomplish college in the future is because it will make me feel successful. Attending college has always been a dream of mine since I was a little kid because I'd always watch documentaries; in these documentaries people would talk about what they had to do in order to feel that their lives were successful, some people had the same reason which was that they had made the choice of attending and finishing college. Being able to have the chance to even attend college is amazing, not everyone in the world is given this opportunity. I know that college is a long time away for me but it's coming sooner than I think. Before I know it I'm going to be out of high school and out in the real world. In order for me to feel like I'm successful I need to finish college. College gives you the information to be successful in the job of your choosing. To me being successful mean you never give up even when things get hard. These are all examples why accomplishing college would make me feel successful.

The second reason why I would like to accomplish college in the future is because it will help me learn what

I need to know in order to get my dream job. Most jobs out in the world require you to have a higher education than high school. College helps you learn specifically about the job you want to do when you become an adult; the job I wanna learn all about is a pediatric oncologist. Being a pediatric oncologist has been my dream job for awhile now because I think that cancer is such a sad thing; people die everyday from cancer. When I get older I want to be able to help treat and get rid of children cancer so that they an live their lives to the fullest; to me helping these kids get rid of their cancer could help prevent it form ever coming back; it doesn't mean that there is a zero percent chance that their cancer won't come back, but I want to help these kids lives last as long as possible. In order for me to actually have the opportunity to apply and receive this job, I can't just have a high school diploma. There are jobs out in the world that do not require you to have a college education; maybe your dream job may not require you to attend school after you finish high school, but not all jobs are like this. These are all examples why college will help me learn what I need to know in order to get the job of my dreams.

The third and final reason why I would like to accomplish college in the future is because I wanna be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college. A lot of people in my family have not attended college due to not having the funds to afford it, having to stay home to take care of a family member, and most just didn't see the point of even attending in the first place. I know that no matter what my parents would do whatever was needed to be able to give me the opportunity to attend college. Personally, one of the really big reasons why I want to finish college is because of my mom. While my mom was attending college she ended up having me; she was a single parent at the time and she did whatever she needed to provide for me. One thing she never got to do was finish college. She stopped all of her dreams just so she could always be there for me. My mom has such a big influence n my life and I want to be able to finish college for her; I want her to see that all of her hard work payed off and make her proud. Knowing I have my mom supporting me no matter what keeps me going everyday, I don't give up on things to show her that I can do anything I put my mind to. Overall, this is why I want to be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college.

In conclusion, not everyone may want to accomplish the same thing, everybody is different, but at then end of the day there's one thing that I want to accomplish the most. Something I would like to accomplish in the future would be attending and graduating college because it will make me feel successful, it will help me learn what I need in order to get my dream job, and I wanna be able to be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college.",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5,4.0
EC7A73638669,"Some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. I agree with this position. I believe that it is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college one year early. Although, some people think that it is not a good idea for students enter college or the work force one year early, nevertheless it can be helpful, because it can help students to start early to college, then they can have enough time to choose what they will want to study, and it also going to promote them to be eficients and take adventage of the time, they will have.

When people have to take a important decision, regularly, they think and they look carefully at all their options. If the students graduate one year early, they will earn time to correctly choose what profession they going to take, and then they will have enough time to elect the college or university where they feel comfortables to go. This is significant, because of one decision depend the future; the experiences that people going to live. With enough time students can give attention to their most important interests, thoughts, and consider possibles changes if it's require. Also people can take adventages of the time that they have, one year is not too much, but in one year is the opportuny for students to select a exceptional career and work and what they always dreamed.

The time is a investment and students have to take advantage of that. Some parents, students, and techers think that if the students graduate a year early, they don't will have time free to play, to share with their families, or to do others activities. The reality is that it going to improve the performance of the students. This method will catch the attention of them and it will show them their priorities. The children have the right to have their free time, but also the parents have the labor to teach them that are precedences that they have to comply with. For example, I took English 10, in summer school in Generic_City, but I was living in Generic_City, I drove every morning, one hour to arrive to my summer school, it was hard wake up early and then drive, but now, I'm sure that it was the best desicion because I'm at few steps of my graduation. People always have to remind that to can get extraordinary rewards, people have to do extraordinary efforts.

On the other hand, some people are not agree with those that offer the special program to graduate early. The opposition believe that students are not sufficiently prepare to graduate before of the schedule time. The contrary side, also think that students have to complete all their high school years to be ready to go to the college or the work. People that is in the opposite side not coincide with the programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years. In addition, some parents are not agree with the options that the program give to their children; to take courses during the summer or in the evenings. Parents refer to this like ""a extra pressure to students."" There are people that suggest that the better choice is that the students complete their four years of high school; however, it can prolong that time for students to graduate.

To conclude, it's important emphasize that in certain cases the pressure is a tool that help people to protrude in their projects and in the life in general. When people take risks and they have the courage to do reality their goals, they going to achieve all of them. The time that people invest in positive accions are transcedent to achieve their goals. The program offer a essential support to students, that going to be useful and it going to show to students that they have the capacity of achive their goals, before that they believed, they just have to establish their academic purposes and demostrate that they have the capacity to achieve it. The program is a great oportunitty to grow and success, one year can be the big difference, and it can approach us closer of that dream.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5
ECCAD55DE7BA,"I agree that we accomplish more if we are always doing something. I think it does because it helps us learn on what to do. We can teach other the same way as well.

We have other people helping us in different ways. For example, we can teach them different ways on doing things they don't feel comforable and that they would feel conforable if they keep doing it. Although it may take time to get use to it they would have experience at the end. Also those people can teach other people. Learning new stuffs is hard but if its a good idea people should do it.

I think we can make a difference by learning new things in our lifes. For example, if there were new ways by playing video games then people should learn it. Although it can get people mad if they lose or anything else. It can be helpful to others in the world. I think they would know a lot more if they did.

We would get a lot done quicker if we had a method on it. For example, other people helping out on big protects to make it happen and work every well. Although it would need a lot of taking to one each other. It can help by not getting to one an other. Getting to know new people by doing things.

If your not doing things you won't get anything accomplish in life. For example, if you don't do well in school that can effect your life by getting a job.

ECF265A73C7E,"According to the Washington Post, there has been an increase in student population in schools around the U.S. they are being crowed with more and more students every year. Because of this more students in the future will need to take online classes at home instead of going to the school and doing so. Being able to do class work at home, will benefit the students that live far from the school; they attend and make it easier for them to get the education they still need. Distance learning will also help the students manage there time better. Because of the fact the students don't have to go and spend time at the actual school. The travel time it takes the students to go and come back from school would not be a factor anymore if they attend online classes in there house.

A reason distance learning could benefit students is that it could improve student attendance. If you were sick and could not go to school you can work on the things you will miss at school. Another thing is that for the students that struggle with transportation to get to school on certain days; instead they can finish the school work at home which would be easier instead of stressing over how they are going to get to school. The way it would benefit students is that it will help them focus more on work than instead of focusing on transportation to school.

This could also benefit on the days that school gets canceled. For example school gets canceled because of a snow day or some other reason. Something that is really big on news right now is the outbreak of the Coronavirus. The U.S. is deciding to close schools in certain states around the country. Distance learning could benefit by if some schools were to actually close, it would not affect student education as much as it would if there was not a way to learn at home. If there was a snow day and some parents did not want there kids to walk to school on the sidewalk because it was dangerous; and they could drive them either because of the fact they had to go to work. A easier and safer way would be just to have them do the school tasks in there house. In the past when it rained or snowed really hard and the next day I had to go to school sometimes the roads would be flooded or their would have been an acident that prevent me from getting to school. In those cases it would be nice to have the option to learn from home instead of going through the trouble to figure out a way on how to get to school.

In some cases it is better for the students to work at school than it is at home. A reason being is at school they can meet new friends and be in a better working and studying envoirment. Another thing would be that their are less things that could distract you from completing work. For example when you are at home you have all your computers, phone, TV, and things like a Xbox that could get you distracted or off topic. When you are at school their are friends that can distract you to but when you are in class it is hard to do anything else besides work. The reason is that your teacher won't let you go on your phone or talk to your friends as much before you finish with your in class assignment. A Benefit from going to school is that a lot of the things that you learn come from talking or hearing it from people at school. So if you attend classes at home instead of going to school it impacts some things that you could actually learn from going to school. A lot of the things I have learned in my past is from talking or asking a friend how to complete an assignment, if you are at home and have nobody to talk to it is not as beneficial as it is going to school.

The fact being that their are benefits from learning at home and learning at school. Because when you are at home you can get distracted easier cause their is no teacher that is watching over you to complete your assignments. But when you are at school you are surrounded by other kids that could talk to you and disturb you on doing your work. Their are pros and cons in both situations but having the option to attend classes at home is better than not having the ability to. Because of that I think that distance learning is better in most cases cause it gives you more options in how you can complete work.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0
ED0A8E614649,"Techonology has becoming powerful that let students and teachers to give and receive classes online. Disadvantages or adventages of taking classes online? These question are faced today by students deciding taking online classes. Often students work part or full time jobs while going to school or collage so their time is valuable. these students want to make the right decisions in choosing classes so knowing the disaventage and adventages is important. I believe that online classes is a good opportunity for students as it gives flexibility, they often offer any type of class desired and provide access to faculty, and they often offer accelerate courses.

To begin with, one of the best adventage of online classes is flexibility. A student can usually take the course any time during the day or week. While there are custom essay writing and researching assigments to complete, the precise time to take the class often depends on the student's desire. Students who work are able to take the class based on their schedule. Many students work on afternoon. The flexibility makes it possible for a person to complete the course, while attending school or collage courses in person might be imposible due to their work schedules.

Secondly, another great adventage of online courses is that almost any type of course can be found online. Distance learning course are often avaliable from a number of collages. A person can simply use the google to find a class. While most people believe a disadventage of taking online courses is that the students can not have access to faculty a member, the fact is that many online courses offer a grater access to faculty. Shy students are able to ask questons and receive the answer back almost inmediately.

Lastly, Online courses are convenient for most undergraduate and graduate students who can study when they want and they can finish writing or researching assigments based on their own person schedules. The fact is online classes offer flexibility and conveniece that are often vital to students who work and have families. In addition, many students are looking for classes that are advanced to complete the course faster. The best way to advance in the class is to make it online because in the regular schools it takes a long time as there are students who get behind and the teachers wait for them since everyone has to go at the same time.

To conclude, with online classes, students do all the work at their own pace. As long as they meet their deadlines and participate apropriately online. Also, studying online requires more self motivation and time mangement skills because students will spend a lot of time on their own without someone physically close to keep them focused on deadlines. Online course will not only teach students geology or poetry, it will also help them become more self motivated, a trait that will make them stand out in the workplace and beyond. It will teach educators to be mature choosing right decisions as it will make them explore more and be students with an open mind.         ",4.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5
ED40DCB2F669,"Do you think is a good idea for student to identify a career at a young age?

In this paper, I will argue about the idea if students should commit to a career at a young age.

I think that commit to a career at a young age is a great idea, because it help student to prepare for the future.

I think is a great idea, because students decide there future at a young age. The student are not going to have time to be doing bad things with there friends, they are going to focus more in the school and in there future. And that way we as student we are going to have batter future, we can be more batter in what we do. It will help us to be more mature, it will help us to act like adult, because we are doing things of adult. it will help us to appreciate the life.

I know many people that they witch they could have a better career, but they don't have it,because they haven't being associate with career courses. I have a friend that he would love to have the career that he wants, but he didn't had experience in what he want, because he had never being associate with the career that he wanted, when he took the decision to have the carer that he wanted, it was to latte. That is why is batter to commit to a career at a young age, because it will help us to be more professional in are career. That will help us to be more responsible. It will help us a lot to know what we want for are future and what is better for us. It will help us to decide are are future.

I have a sister that she have great skill, and she is really focus in what she wants to be in her future, and she is doing her best to make her dream's reality, however is to hard to make her dream really because I think she is not ready for the career that she wants, she don't have that much experience.

It would be much better if she would commit to that career at a young age. She would have more experience, she would be more prepare, she would be more professional. I know many people that would love to have a better career, but they don't have it because they don't have experience and they give up easily, because they feel that they are not ready. commit to a carer at a young age it make us to to more professional.

Some people say that commit to a career at a young age is not a good idea, because they are to young and they don't know what they want, and Also they are going say, that commit to a career at a young age will ex tress the student and that student are not going to have time for there friends, they would argue that identify a career at a young age is not good idea, because student at a young age are not ready for identify there career, they would say many things, but they are wrong because identify a career at a young age make us, as student more professional and help as to know what we want to be in are future, and identify a career at a young age is like identify are future.

Identify are future at a young age make us more professional.

In the future the number of unemployment people will decrease, because the student are going to be more professional, they will commit to a career at a young age and that way the life will be more easy. It would be less people doing bad things, the students are going to be more responsible, we will be more better in what we do. but for that we have to give the example to other generation.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
ED937FC56246,"The one thing I hope I accomplish is to get a high paying job. I would want a high paying job since it could pay off many things that I don't need to pay later. My reasons is to travel to many places I've never been to, buy many things as I want without spending my family money's, and I would try many different foods that could be expensive.

One reason why my accomplishment is getting a high paying job is to travel around the world or place that I never been to. Traveling around the world could be really expansive since your going to buy many things you would need or don't need. Sometimes traveling depends on where you are going since some places are cheap or expansive. Having a lot of a good amount while traveling is a good because you could do anything you want with that money while your not at home. I think having a high paying job is good for traveling is not always cheap, you can buy anything you've ever wanted and not worrying much about using to much money.

The next reason is to buy many things as I want without spending any or some of my parents or family members money. This is important because it wouldn't matter much if you used you own money but if you use your family money you might have to pay them back later on. Another reason is going out when you want to and you dont really want to spend your family money because you need a lot since you could be going to many places. When you want to take your family out to a really nice place or a place where you think they would enjoy or relax, you can just surprise them by already getting it done and paid off. Another reason it is a good idea to get a high paying job, to not spend your family money.

The last reason is trying many different foods that could be expansive. From my experiences I know that most places has really expansive food that is really good. I also know that going to a super fancy restaurant is expansive since all the foods could be really good or just a rip off. Sometimes going to really fun places or vacations foods are expansive because it could taste good and many people would might want to try some, also if it was cheap many people would've gone crazy. Paying for good expansive food is worth it then paying too much for something that taste bad.

In conclusion that a high paying job is good for traveling to places you've never been to, spending lots of money without using your families money, and eating or buying really expansive foods. Going to places you have never been to is great. Spending our own money lets us buy anything we want. Also buying or trying new foods is really nice when you can buy it. This is why I want my accomplishment to be a high paying job.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

EF7E0CBD62D2,"I am agree whit this statement about the importance of attitude. because If you have good attitude, you can thinking carefully about the life we commit error every time. But we can learn the a adult he can give me a good advice.

If you have good family your attitude can be patient with the other people i know some time we keep bad moment but you can step out with your friends and forget everything, and you can reflect very wall your parents can be teach, good thinks and they can give you a advice for your, life some people dont like give you advice because they said we dont matter the life. some people said the adolescent not matter how they said but we are conscious the outcome.

My opinion is important to do good think in your life. Because the people remember like a good person they dont said something bad of you is important to have good attitude because is mirror how you are,in the school you need to have a good attitude because you dont want problem with the other people.

I remember some day my grandparent told me dont get problem because is bad attitude what you show to the other people you will prepare for the future when you are adult you know how to do with your boys you have good experience to show they and they can believe you.

F032D40816C0,"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm I think is a good idea because, you can be a successful person, you need believe in yourself, and you need support of your family.

You can be a successful person, because you can do all the things that you have in mind, and you can realize more than you already have, for example once my friend Generic_Name told me that her cousin Generic_Name he loves fix computers, but he only can fix computers he can not fix telephones, TV, refrigerators and another electronics devices and he always was sad because his goal was that he can fix all the electronic devices, he join in a group of people that fix electronic devices, he always cry because he did not understand the things that he was learn, he always was try day to day, so one day he was the winner in the competition of who was the person that fixed one TV in the less time as possible, he fixed the TV in 1 minute, other people fixed in 10 or 5 minutes, finally he earn a diploma of the best fixed person, after 5 years he learn that nothing was impossible for him , in the actuality he has a store that he sell and fix electronic devices. The experience of Generic_Name is a good example in our life because he learn that never give up, he always fight for his goals and that example we can do exactly the same that Generic_Name always fight for our goals and always try another new things that we think that we can not do.

Also the reason that you need believe in yourself is that you always need be positive person, every day see what are the things that you need for have success or what you need to do every day. In my experience I was in 10th grade was my first day of school at Generic_School,I never was with a lot of nervous, and I did not speak English ,so all my classes in my first day of school I feel many eyes on my because I was the new student, then at the end of my day I take my correct bus and when I was at home talking with my mom I told her that I do not like the school because was different of my schools on my country and my mom told me that with the pass of the days I will feeling a good person, a correct person. So in my first year in the school I get all my classes with A at the end of my first year I earn one diploma in Math and four diplomas for each end of the quarter, so I pass 11th grade with excellent grades too, but sometimes I fail my classes my test in Algebra I fail many of the test or sometimes I get D or F in my classes and when I fail something is when I was think that I am not good in my classes or in English that was to hard learn the language English, all my teachers talk with me that I was a good student always complete my work, every day I was pay attention to my teachers, and then I pass to 12th grade this year is more difficult because I need pass all my classes, all my ESOL and other things for example my WISE test, and now my teachers, my counselor, my mom told me that I am a excellent person, and sometimes I think leave the school and start to work because I feel that I cannot go to the end of High School . This is my experience and I believe that sometimes I am wrong because loss enthusiasm it is not a good idea always I will have failure or another experiences that are not good.

And this is why we need believe in our self if you do not believe in your self you may be you do not complete all your goals or all that you have in mind.

Other people say that success consists of going from failure to failure and loss enthusiasm, but otherwise you need support of your family because the family is very important in your life and always you need a opinion from your family. For example one day my uncle

Generic_Name he was in his college George Mason his family was in Mexico he was the only person that was in Generic_City. He always try to do all of the way correct and always be a good student and a good person, but one day he fail a very important test in the college that test was the final test in his College, and if he fail this test he can not graduate from College and he was feel like a person that he can not do anything and he told to his friend Generic_Name that he did not pass the final test, but Generic_Name said to Generic_Name that he can not tell to Generic_Name's family because they may be feel sad for Generic_Name, so the option for Generic_Name was that he was need start one more time all the College or he can paid extra money for retake the final test, but was a lot of money, so he decided that he was taking one more time all the College, but he do not see for support of his family, finally Generic_Name told to Generic_Name's family what happens with Generic_Name and why he still do not graduate from College, and Generic_Name's family talk with Generic_Name and he tells the true and his family tell him that why he do not see for support in his family. This example is exactly the explain for why the support of your family is very important, the family is the first group of people that we need to tells them always the true and they will have a excellent opinion about what you asking them.

In conclusion, loss enthusiasm when you are failure it is not a good idea because can be a successful person, you need believe in yourself, and you need support of your family. And always think about what are the things that you are complete or for what you need this goals. Also, think about that if you failure you need keep going and never give up because if you feel that you can not do anything all your life may be your will think that you not are a good person in something that you have in mind. Finally think about all the good things have a successful person and how you can do like a successful person what you need to do or what materials you need for be a successful person.

Having confidence is a big thing to many people because thay can do many thing in life and will not fail. Having confidence can help people in many places. For example,If you are going to a job interview you will have to have a high confidence in you ,In order to get the job. Making your own decisions will help you build up more confidence.

My second reason why I agree with people who make thier own decisions in life is because, you will have higher chance of accomplishments. If you make your own decisions you can have many accomplishments,because if you make good decisions in life you have more chance of success. You can accomplish anything you want if you make your own decisions,because making your own decisions can be anything you want and you dont have to follow anyone.

My third reason why I agree with people who make thier own decisions in life is because, It will help people understand from their mistakes.

F1329DA98283,"How much can we accomplish if we are always doing? Thomas Jefferson once wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I think he is right, if you think about it, the more you do, the more you will get and learn.

Over time, we've seen how many people had accomplish their dreams and goals, because they were always trying and working hard for what they wanted and what they needed. If we are always working hard, we can achieved what we want and even more, I think that's what Jefferson wanted to said with his words, the more you learn and do over your life, the more you will get, people will need you, and because they will need you, they would do whatever they can to get you.

Let me put you an example, think about your job, imagine you work in a restaurant, and you start as a cashier, and then you start to learn more, like you start to work in preparation, and then you put your hands in the kitchen, over time, you learn the system of the restaurant, how it work and everything; next thing you know you are the manager, but then you get tired and you quit your job, so then you can open your own place, and thanks to all you did in the restaurant now you have the experience to run your own place, and even better. Everything you get in your life will be thanks to all you try and learn, because even though sometimes things get difficult, it will always have a reward at the end.

This is like when we were kids, and our parents made us do things that we didn't like, for example, when I was a kid I hated to do my reading and writing homework, because I didn't know to do it, but now that I think about it, thanks to all the homework I did, now I know how to read and write in Spanish and English, because even though I didn't want to do my homework, my parents push me to do it, to learn and to be better every day. When I was a kid, my grandma always told me to said ""excuse me and thank you,"" at some point I did it because my grandma told me to do it, but now I see that my grandma though me something a lot of people forgot to do. Everything we learn make us better everyday.

Some people may believed inactivity is also something good; sometimes doing nothing, is doing more, and is okay to just stop everything and take a break once in a while, but just wait to see if things work by their own is not the best, if you want things to work in your life you have to work hard and never stop, because if you don't work for what you want nobody else will do it for you.

I am writing this essay with the porpuse of desagreement with the idea of providing this ""benefit"" to the students, this is a way of making students lose interest in school because they might think that they don't have to take the conference every time and they willl think that they can do it whenever they want which gives to think that they aren't prepare for making good decisions when it comes with schools classes. In my opinion this is an opportunity that the schools gives to the students to drop out of high school considering that students are teenagers and they don't have the same amount of responsability than adults in most cases.

As a student I desagree with this option. We need to be able to communicate, create good group work, and meet people and I can assure that most of the students will ended up leaving this classes when they half way done. Being with more students make classes fun, helpful and even more interesting, students sometimes needs to have a adult teaching them and having a conversation face to face instead a computer taking to them.

Taking classes online is a benefit when you know how to manage time for example: My brother is a college student who is getting his master degree in Genetic Engineering some of his classes wasn't a requirement that he had to take them inside school so he decide to take them online so he can have more free time when it comes with work and school. He made a study plan which consist in spending one hour each day so he can focus on his online classes which helps him to study for every single of his classes.

My friend Generic_Name is a senior on high school and she decided to take two of her classes online so she can have enough time for work, school activities, and graduation plans. She has been overwhelm with all her activities and assignments which it made her drop out of one of her two online classes, she said she felt like she couldn't do it by herself which it made her start getting bad grades in her school classes. Later she decided to take those classes in school so she can have her classmate help her in case she get stuck in a topic. I think this opportunity can make students get stuck and give up on school which it can't happen because we are the future.

In conclusion this option has it advantages and disavantages which for some people might seems good and differentes but for some other this option seems to be useless when it comes with the progress that we do inside the school.",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5

having a chance to meet new people, to know more about my classmates and even make new friends. I believe that working in group is more beneficial than working alone.

I think that having the opportunity to meet new people is really important. When I meet new people; I feel inspired, confident and happy. Because most of the time I like to share my ideas with other people. Although, not all time they will feel related to my ideas, but that's one way I make new friends by demonstrating my interest. I also like to hear peoples' ideas and stories. For example, I like to hear peoples' stories about their life and childhood.

I personally like to get good grades on school projects. I think that when I work in groups I feel more confident of what I am doing. I also do my work on time, and I even put an extra effort on my task to get a decent grade. For example, If I make a mistake my teammates will let me know. I will learn from my mistakes. If I make a mistake does not mean that I didn't try, I always try my best every day, to be a better person. So I can not complain that I do not have support because I do have it.

Some people say, that working in groups is not beneficial as working alone, people usually complain that they easily get distracted. But I think they are wrong. Because working in groups is more beneficial than working alone. When I work in groups I receive the support from my teammates. But when somebody is working alone they do not receive any support. So I think that working in groups is an easy and beneficial way to do my job and get a good grade.

When I work in group there's a lot a benefits I can get: I can meet new people, hear new stories from new people etc. If I get a school project and I have to choose whether to work alone or work in group, I will choose to work in a group without thinking twice. Because I have experience how good it feels to work in groups.

Sincerely: Generic_Name ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0
F30AD5A2B74A,"Do you agree with ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm, yes or not? I agree with Churchill's statement of success consists of going to failure to failure without loss of enthusiams because not all the time we can win or make the things perfect. For example, when I took my English test last year in my English class. I practiced a lot and I did my best for taking A+ or maybe B+, but I did pass the test. I was very sad, however, my teacher told me that I had a second chance. So, I took it and this time I passed with A-, I was so excited. To fall out the test made me to understand that it doesn't matter how many times we can fall out about what we want, we only need to be strong and try as much as we can for being successful. Moreover, this year my aunt was trying to travel to El salvador, but when she called to the airline for buying the ticket, the tickets were so spends and she doesn't have to much money, so she decided to wait few months. seven month ago she called again to the airline and the prices tickests increase more money, but she didn't want to continue waiting more time so she decided to buy it, when she was buying the tickets the person told to her of her ID was already expire, so she can not buy the ticket. My aunt was sad because she did not remember about to renew her documents, but she went to renew her documents some weeks later and after that she has to wait at less three months to receive the new ID. at this time the three months already pass and she didn't receive her ID, she's really sad because she wants to go visit my grandmother. even thoug she can't travel yet, she doesn't lose her enthusiasm of travel this year to my country. Churchill's statement of success consists of going to failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm is more than true because anybody is perfect and we need to fall out for learn lessons and learn to be stronger persons in the life. some people think this statement is not true because some of them loss multiple times for being successful in their life. also, they say when the person loss the first two times they're losers, stupy persons, or other bad things that are not right. in my oponion this cause happend to them or they are saing that because they loss their enthusiams and become weak person. in conclusion, for being successful we have to fall out in the life, like when i fall out my test and with my aunt cause. this teach to everyone to be stronger person and never lose their enthusiams of be successful in each persons life.

F39FFFB63840,"I agree that failing plays a important role of success. Is because you can learn form your miss tack, you can understand why your keep failing and fix the problem, and you don't make a same miss tack again. However, I do see why some people don't think the same way. It because they don't want take a risk to fail at anything and no one want to admit that they failed on something. But it not as bad as you think, hears why.

First, everyone my miss tack and you can learn from that miss tack . For examples, when I failed to shot a goal, I what to know why I keep missing a goal. After a weal I learn how to properly shot it. A nuder examples are, my friend like to draw a person but he always have a problem to draw a hands. He try to learn why he keep failed to draw a hands and time go by, he finally learn how to draw a hands.

Then, you can understand why you keep failing and fix the problem. For instens, I always keep failing to payatensh, so I understand what was a problem and trying to fix that problem. A nuder examples are, when I keep reading I always keep miss pushing it . So I be reading thirty mines every day and it help me.

Lastly, you won't make a same miss tack again. For examples, when I found out that I failed my reading test I what to know what part that I miss, when I toked again I pass the reading test. A nuder examples are, when I made a miss tack to get a figure that almost filthy baler, and at the same time I have to pay my bills. So I learn my miss tack, at the time when I pay my bills I won't get a figure that almost filthy baler.

Inconclusun, failure is not as bad as you think, it can help you to success for instens you can learn form your miss tack, you can understand why your keep failing and fix the problem, and you don't make a same miss tack again. I hope you understand why failing plays a big role of success.",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0
F3F4454A2E3B,"Most companies look for specific characteristics in potential employees. Some people think that companies shouldn't look for specific characteristic in people and let the person thats applying, get the job and learn while he/she is working with the company.

Some people have a better education than others, which that would be one of the characteristics that company would be looking for, trying to hire someone. But sometimes those people aren't good working with other people and in my opinion that is very important to keep and good work environment. I think I'm a very good candidate because, I'm good working with people, I am always willing to work extra hours if you need me to, and finally I'm may not have much experience on this kind of work but I'm a pretty hard worker and will try my absolute best to learn the job.

One reason, I think I should be hired is that I'm good working with people. One of the things I enjoy the most about working is the ability to work and share ideas with people in my past jobs, I feel like it makes the work environment a lot better because it make the work easier and more enjoyable. Because the more are working together the job gets done faster, I'm always willing to help if anybody needs me I'll be there planning things out with the person give him/her feed back on what she thinks and work out something that can work for both the company and themselves. I try get along with all my work partners so I can make it the best experience for me and for everyone else around me.

Another reason, is I'm always willing to work extra hours if needed. I worked extra hours in past jobs before because for one my work co workers because they were sick. So if you ever need me to work for extra hours don't hesitate to give me a call. Because we all need a break sometimes, but there are times where we can't give the workers that break because the company doesn't have enough people to cover that person. That's why I'm willing to work longer hours so those workers can take that break they so much desire.

Finally, I'm a hard worker like you read in the last paragraph I'm willing to work longer hours, so that should give you an idea. What ever job you give me I'll do it at the best of my ability, it doesn't matter what it is I'll do it. Although I dont know how to do much of what this type of does, I'll do my best to learn it as fast as possible so I can give you the best results I can give. I'm always willing to do something new and challenging so I can extend the things I know, All I want you to know is that what ever you tell to do I will give my one hundred percent.

As you have read this why I think I make a good candidate and a good addition to your team. I'm good working with people, I'm willing work longer hours if needed, and I'm a hard worker. I hope you consider hiring me and i hope the best for the company. I think only when you see me actually working in your company and see the things I'm able to bring to the table you will see I was the best option for the job. Thank you for reading and taking my application for consideration.        ",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0

F4BE7BB77A43,"Tomas Jefferson say is wonderful how much may be done if always diong. And is one of the reason I deagree with Jomas because if the person always doing something learning stuff they never before do. Is wonderful how much the person can be do and learning new stuff if always work hard. One of the many reason of the human is a intelligent,stroong,smart and do new stuff no matter if they are easy or difficult. If they work hard can be do everithing.

For example the human not born with the capacity to walk or speak all human learng how do new stuff not matter how dificult ther are because more do more learng. One of the big point of always do somehing is prepare for life,is not easy but diong something to make sure the person is in the right way is the most important things the person need to know. Teaching personality and work hard is the big stuff, however one point of life the thing come hard but teaching how go and do resolve the problem. Not matter how be is the problem you need to go and do something then make how strong the person are. The person need to struggle with problems but learning and work hard is the main reason why the person is strong. On one point has the access to take something and work on that, but doing something is how learning new need stuff. Example the person who invent the technology they work hard and always do somethig to make they dream to come real and thas why diong somethihg and do the best potential is how make all the stuff of life. The person who study and prepare to make thay dreams are those work and not matter hoe big is the way they make one aesy way to continue they dream.

Doing somethigs always is the reason why the society do big work define new thing new technology new life becuase always are doing somethis. The person not born with all the intelligent not they learn how walk,speak and one point of life they go to school they not know everything. Not they do something the work hard, however a lot person are very smart but they continue to learn always doing something because they want to a better because they want to suppor the world and they family a better place. Likely the most professional always do something to make sure they life are excel of the most difficult piont of they life becuase always work hard and make new things, because not matter how low they education the person take always can be a better person because always try to define the best decition and the best example to the society. A different way to make the personality strong is find new ways to the problem. Life is like a game more things more work more aesy is to make the things.

If the person always are diong something new and the not choose to stay an d the same place all the time. And the person choose to continue doing new stuff and new work they not need to be the most smart person on the world. They need to work and show they can be do,however they walt to be not matter if they how be a stong personality and not matter is they't go the best school or the best college. Only matter how they be and the profession and the work. If the person or the society do somethig they can be the future. For example one day the person get up and choose to do something and make sure they days are very beautiful do new projects they can be came be make they life more aesy to continue. Life and work are like a gardener more flowes the person add more beautiful they came to be is like work more thing you learng more easy life come. one point they persono can't be continue but all the things thy learn more aesy came to be going up.

That why more things do make goals they persons can find, not matter were the person came or were the born always doing something more intellegent the person can to be. However a lot person are very smart but they continue to learn always doing something because they want to a better or find new technology or make a different on this world. One of the big point of always do somehing is prepare for life. All the persons are not the same one they has more technology to they dream,but others person not and this is not one obstacle to make they dream. Because all the time are be doing something and not wait to came things came not they go find and work hard to make all be came to be positibe they not have obstacles they have the strong to be come a better person. And show everyone not matter how difficult are the problem they came be successfuly person. Like Thomas Jefferson say always diong somethings much be done and is true because the person came to this life and learng everything, a lot person move to other place, need to learng need lenguage, need tradititiones and need people is hard but with the time can be learnig everything and continue the life again with need stuff thas is what is important to always diong on and be done what they need to be done and make sure do the best and hork hard and show a good and strong personality. And accomplish more if always they're something on specific point of life can to be so difficult but working hard and with discipline all can be come more aesy and undertake a new dream and new stuff of life can be come the best tool to widely and known as the most expert guidance to life. Base of all the information always doing somethig more thigs can be done and the persons can be accomplish and determine what strong thye personality they are.",2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.0,2.0

One reason this would be most beneficial is that the younger students are getting there education from someone who already knows about the basic of reading, pronouncing words the younger students just have not reach potentacil and these older students are pushing these younger kids the right way.

Another reason Having older students pair up with younger students is a very beneficial idea is that it teaches a students what skills are necessary to be a teacher just encase they want to be a teacher one day.

Third reason a younger student pairing up with an older student is beneficial is because it makes the older student feel more responsible for somebody else is learning like making sure the younger student knows this like making sure he/she knows how to pronounce words correctly make sure the younger student can be organized.

A fourth reason that proves younger kids pairing up with older kids is beneficial is that the teacher has a couple less students to deal with so less stress to deal with younger kids can be annoying to deal with sometimes.",3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5

Some school doesn't allow students to used cell phone because the teachers says that students can find the information in books. Students says that by using cell phone is much easier to find information than in books.

Some teachers allow students to use cell phone during class so that students can find information easier. If students used books, some of the students can't even find the information that the students needed. for example, students that used cell phone is more likely to finish earlier than students that using books. in additions, Cell phone have more information than book. So, teachers should allow students to used cell phone during class for educational purposes.

Schools should allow the students to used cell phone in the class, so that students can work much faster and easier. If schools doesn't allow the students used phone in the class, some students going to have a hard time to work and students is going to take to much time on the assignment. Lots of students prefer cell phone because it much easier to find information. If students used books, students will take time to go back and forth and find the information that the students needed. Schools should allow the students to used cell phone in the class.

Technology is getting efficient and faster, so schools should let students used the technology so that students can get more information and can search any assignment that students need. Technology is adding new stuff every day, so that the students can learn something new every day. If students used the technology, students can get smarter and technology will improve every day. If students used books, students will never learn new things and students will have the same information. Schools should let the students use the technology so that the students will have more knowledge.

In conclusion, Teachers should not keep giving students books to study because students will never learn new thing in life.

It's not normal for that to happen and it will feel weird harder stuff for the younger ones don't know and the older kids think it's too easy. There's so much reasons that it shouldn't happen doesnn't feel right.

If it was like in the summer for an activity that would be great because you learn about how the older and younger kids are. The younger kids will want to do childess stuff and the older ones want to just be on there phones and just talk. Sometimes the older ones need to teach the younger ones to be more grown up so they learn about the older ones. The teachers mostly will try to tell the older ones to help the younger ones to be grown up.

So usually they shouldn't create schools like that it will feel completly different because there will be different stuff then real schools with older and older kids and younger and younger kids. The younger ones could sometimes scream and run or goof around a lot and the older ones sometimes will feel annoyed by them. So lot's times I feel like the older ones will feel unconfortable from the little ones. When you grow older you learn what you do now and not like when you were younger.

Most the time you usually want to be friends with people your age not too much of a different age. Sometimes it can happen to be friends with someone older or younger but most times your age. Always try to be yourself and not change your additude. Sometimes the older kids will need to try make the little kids happy by talking with them and have fun with them. But not for to long you should because it will get boring doing it for a long time. When u finshis they will sometimes try bothering you because they liked what you did but just leave them alone after.

These are examples why sometimes you should or shouldn't allow those schools with older and younger students. After when you grow older you the one teaching the new kids to be grown up. Try remeber the times you were little and what the older kids did to you do that with others. But there could be lot's of times younger ones a different and you were that way 8 years ago.

. When you are taking online classes you are allow to work whenever you want

One more disadvantage is that when the students are taking classes online they attend to loss interest and prefers do other things instead of do their assignments

,because they don't even care about their grades because they don't have a teacher to pressure them to do their assignments ,but everything depends how much interest the student put in pass the online classes to improve the grades and gained more knowledge .Sometimes when the students take online classes and regular school they attend to violated the rules of the school because they are accustomed to be in the habit of work at home they dont want to follow the directions of the teacher, and they also what to do whatever they want and that is not fear for the teacher who has to tolerate it.

Number one we finish the assignement alot faster. Number two everyone is working on something different. Number three everyone is helping each other if we struggling on something. There is the bad part about working in a group is that there is alot of distration, there is also different ideas that everyone wants to put in the assignment. Now lets look at the good part on woekinmg on the assignment alone. number one there is no distractions getting in between you working. Number two there is only your idea on how you want it to look like. Number three you can ask the teacher on how sheor he wants the assignment to be done, so that means that the assignment is going to be correctly done. The bad part on working alone is that there is going to take more time on the assignment to be done. the other part is that is that you have to do all the wrok by your self and have to rely on your self. Other words if you pick to work in a group or by your self, are going to be struugling kinda the same thing like how mush work you have to finish, the different ideas on how you wnat it to be looking linke or how you want it to be done. Ones again for a student like me i rather work in a group than by myself because knowing my self i wont finish my work or the assingment. In a group i can have one part on the assignment that i have to finish. You can say i am picking on working in a group to do less work, and you are right because its going to be done instead of not doing the whole assignment. so for my coclusion i would want to work in a group instead of working alone because ""team work makes the deam work.""",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5

For Example:

some people that are here in the United States they have to go to school and work after school, and they got to pay rent, send money to their families back in there Contries.

For Example:

Some of the people don't have someone that can take them to school and the school is far away that the buses can not go all the way to their homes.

For Example:

There are some kids that don't go to school, having the school next to them, but there's alot of people out here thet would love to go to school or even take online classes but they can't because some of them are always working, some of them even have two jobs.

For Example: My mom wouold loved to take online classes at less but she can't because she has to work in the very morning like at 7 am, and she comes back like at one she cleans the house and then like at 3pm she goes to her other job and she gets out like at 11:30 pm so she doesn't have time but she would love if she could do it.

For Example: My dad he's going all the way to DC for school because he is taking classes for duster he pays each moth and my dad works to in countruction but weekends she goes to DC the classes start like at 10 and they end like at 1,

For Example: I have a friend that he takes online he work's everyday, he takes his computer to his work so when he's on break runs to the computer and he starts school online like that someone that wants to progress in this country.

F73899060D94,"Do you remember when you decided what you wanted to be? ''your character will be what yourself choose to make it''.Do we choose our own character traits,or is our caracter formed by in fluences beyond our control.

I agree Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it. because, you make your own desicions,you take responsability,and you have goals. However many,believe that people influence the way we choose our characters because they think they have the rigth to critize the way people decides. Actually,this is a bad idea because people makes their own decisions,In society most of the time we have to take a decision whether are rigth or wrong we must take it at some point but is also,your choice to make the best out of it. For example,My brother had to take a decision by himself which was doing something in life going to collage study or work as an Mcdonals co-worker he decided the best was going to collage and keep studying. If,my brother wouldn't have taken that decision then he had lost an opportunity to make it.

The second reason your character will be what your self choose to make it, is that you take responsability because taking responsabilities make a better character of your self. For example,when you wake up early just to be on time at work every day you feel you are giving the best of you yourself are choosing to make your character. If,you are not giving the best of you every day that means you are no choosing to make your own character.

The third reason your character will be what your self choose to make it,is that you have goals because you want to feel satified when you have achieve something important in your life.

This can also sat that the person think's you are loyal and trustworthy and that they can believe in you more then they already did. Yes is may hurt the person feelings,but, you are there to help them get though it and make them feel OK.

When being honest with people it can build up trust with you two because they know that you can talk about things without lying. This can also effort how they see you as a person. Even if the truth hurts them they know that you were able to tell them what was happening or if someone was saying something bad about them. This can also build up trust and build up friendship and relationship. People don't like it when you lie to them because it hurts them and makes them feel bad about them self.

Honesty can change how people view you as a person. They can even see if you would be loyal to them when they need you the most. They can also see if your a real friend or something more with being honest. This can also give you respect that you want or need. When I said they would view you different I meant by your personalty and how you are as a person.

Yes, honesty can hurt them,but, lying hurts the most. Why I'm saying this because honesty can hurt but it make them feel better because they have someone they trust and believ them, a real friend. Lying and changing up the word can hurt them and even mess them up and change them. That why I agree with being honest all the time.",2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5
F8FE459205F4,"Do you agree with churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success?

Should i agree that when someone fail and if they continuo doing what they were doing they will success later on?

I'm agree because when you make mistakes you'll learnd from it, and next time when you do it you will be better than what have you done in the past. If you are a failure and if you keep trying then i'm proud of you because thats the mean that you're in the good path and that you'll achive your goals soon. My reasons are nobdy is perfect and no one will be perfect ever, my second reason is even famous people have fail and now they're in the top, and my tird reason is there are some people who like to accomplish their dreams by working hard and never letting other people stop them.

To start with nobody is perfect, is because we all can make mistakes and also because it is okay to make mistakes, no one had died because they fail doing something like work from school or stuff from work. So it is like when you go to other country and you have to try new things like their languge, their food. their traditions and all the stuff that their country have and I konw that sometimes to feel like you'll never be like them, you'll never understand what they are saying, but it is false because I am a immigrant, I came to the United States when I was 14 years old not knowing any english, with only one person by my side that was my mom, and leaving everything behind. For one moment I think that I was never going to get used to this country, that I was never going to understand english and that I was never going to be enough to this country but now I can say that I can speak english I can writte in english and that all the people (brothers,and sister)

that I left behind I still love and that someday I will returned and I will tell them everything.

To continuo with famous people had failed in their past, and i'm saying this is people I know that to be where they are now they have done alot of work and they've done alot of sacrifices too like leaving their family behind because they did no support them or maybe because they didn't like that profession, friends becuase some of them are fake or maybe because they want to help them to progress, maybe schools need to be more focus about they work like wrinting songs or even focusing more in their dance, works because you need to choose the one that you like more, and I can tell that it did not stop them, they keep fighting to be better each day to give all the best about them to have a mentality about progress. I've seen alot of famous videos about people that I like and i've cried because some of their stories are really sad and I know what they where feeling that time. You can follow famous people and i admire them because they have fail millions of time and they've never stop doing what they love to do.

To finallice with that if you are one of those persons who like to accomplished dreams then you should never give up because thats what looser (mediocre) people do, they give up when they see that something is hard or maybe because they are shy about them how they look like if they are pretty or no or maybe because they don't like their work because the people is mean or their managge is agressive in the term how he express so they decide to quit. We always tried to put the best and to be the best of us even when you know that you can fail, that there are other people that are good too but you tried and you put effort on it so if you fail you'll know that you win because to did it and you finished it. You never can think that you are a failure if you didn't win, you can see that you are good in some other things where other people is no good. You will always have options you can choose if you want to tried hard or if you don't.

To conclude I am strongly agree that failure plays in the pursuit of success because nobody is perfect and if someone wants to be perfect then they'll need alot of work, we also know that even famous people have fail so if they have fail we should fail too beause then we will see what we had done wrong and we can fix it, and also even when it means that you need to leave that people that you love behind. Furthermore even though sometimes it takes a little too long to notified how much we have success and because we don't see that, we're mad with our lifes, we think that if we don't have a good possition at our work is because were not good enough but it is not truth because they are some people that doesn't have work or some others supplies and were complaining about our possition at work. It is not fair to have that kind of mind because we all should be happy with what we have and with what we can affort. Furthermore been a failure doesn't mean that you don't know how to do something or that you can not win. Been a failure means that for more that you fail the better you get and the more capacity you'll have later.       ",3.5,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5

To begin, you need to accomplish something you are struggling with in order to find your dream job. One thing you can accomplish is something that is school related. In fact, when I was in 4th grade disliked art class even when my sister said it was fun and easy I would just refuse everything that is related to art. In 5th grade as a student I was required to take art class and I thought that it would boring to be in a art class. In the middle of 5th grade I actually changed my mind about art class, sooner or later I found out that art class was something that I wanted to finish. Ever since 5th grade my mood for art class grew to be one of my likings. As a 8th grader now I am still taking art class and it is actually really enjoyable to be in art.

Secondly, it will help you find your hobby and your needs. Another thing you can do to accomplish something like English class or even just school in general is trying your best. Even when you think you can just skip it, you will somehow come back to it. In fact, when I was in 6th grade my grades were A's and C's one class however was an F, that class was English class. I didn't do my homework for English class and rejected help from the English teacher. In the beginning of 7th grade that same subject was getting harder and my grade for English decreased. At the middle of marking period 3 I decided that I had to do the classwork so I can create a new habit of trying to do work. I soon found out when I was trying to complete my missing work there was one assignment that caught my eye, That assignment was a book report that was supposed to be written. I tried the book report and soon I realized that I loved writing.

Lastly, completing something that is a challenge for you will help you find your strength in a certain subject and finding your strength will help you graduate. In fact, when I accomplished art class in 5th grade I found out that art was one of my strengths that was I only needed to try. I also found out that writing was something that could help me graduate and get me to my find one of my two careers. Art class helped me learn that I am actually really creative and helped me figure out that art was something that relieved my stress when it comes to school. English class helped me figure out that writing was one of my strengths and it will help me figure out my main career.

F99B20789DD7,"Dear Schoolboard,

I think that school should not be extended. students need to have a long break at home because they might have after school clubs to attend to.

I think students should not have extended school because they are not going to pay attention to the teacher they need to rest their brains for a long time since you are in school for 7 hours. Another reason why i think students should not have extra time at school is because kids have to wake up early and they are tired so they wont pay attention since they dont get enough sleep.

The other reason why i think school should not be extended is because the students most of them do not pay attention so typically the teacher is wasting her time trying to teach them. Also why i think they should not extend school is because if the day is longer they are going to need more breaks during the day and it takes a little long to go back in the building.

On the other hand i think they should have a extended school because they will know their subjects faster and that will make the school year faster. Another reason why i think they should extend school is because the students are really bored at home and they wish to learn instead of being home board. The last reason why

I think school should be extended is because kids might not pay attention during the day so with the extra hour they might want to pay attention and they will learn a little.

The last reason why i think school should be extended is because the students do things outside of home that are not good for them like doing challenges,steeling or getting into fights outside of school which can cause them injuries. The other reason i think they should extend school is because students would or will have a better education so that when they are grownups they will find a job that pays you more than the others.

These are the reasons why i think students should and should not have school extended i think they should extend school for a better education and i think they should not extend school because it is way too long",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0
F9C298BF7CE5,"I agree with this prompt that positive attitude is the key to success because, with positive attitude it gets a person where they want to be in life. However with negative attitude you will never get anywhere at all, it will make a person lose confident, also would make you give up right there on the spot which means you gave up your a quitter. Then soon turn into a really bad habit that can't be stopped. Attitude is very important, and the way you use it can really affect the success that your trying to reach and to others ,its also very easy to just lose it all in less than a heart beat. I believe positive attuide is the key to success because it motivates a person to do good or better, spreads positvity to others who really need it,and makes you learn from your mistake because no one is perfect.

How can positive attitude motivate you to do good? well ya see when your having that energy that makes you believe you can do anything, or that anything is possible that's motivation for you to keep trying and embracing that positively well make a person stand out. By doing that it makes a person feel good about themselfs and motivates us to keeping that same energy. This is why it's important just by your attitude can have a huge impact on your success and how you use it is very important. By motivating your self, and others themselves will be motivated which is a really good thing. It's like your helping others out one of the first things to do to become successful , to help each other out and having a lot of patients is all in that positive attuide. This plays many key roles in the real world and will make a huge difference as well. An example, walking in for an interview being positive at all costs and respectful shows signs that your interested therefore you would have a possibility of getting hired and can go from there you will be a very successful person. I know everyone is successful in there own ways but there are limits and attitude plays a huge role in that.

spreading positively to others is another important topic because these people might not be doing so well but you can always help change that for a person. By boosting their confident to make them happy comes from positive attuide because in life, theres no time to be playing games there's very little time to accomplish your success before it's over and soon to be regretted. Also in encouraging others will make you extremely happy that right there will get you somewhere in the future and it will be good. most jobs in this life style today sometimes go based of skills and etc. But Mostly look into a great positive attitude, there are a lot of benefits to this in reality being skillful and useful. When something doesn't go as planned, keep trying bring that positive attitude forward never give up it's not too late to change. Taking a test and having it being extremely hard when given negative attuide you will fail and face the consequences but doing the opposite you would be much more relaxed,and will boost that confident up into keep trying because life is full of mistakes you have to push and keep trying now that's what being successful is almost about. Albert enstin did he give up? No right? and look at where hes at he became one of the most successful person ever same with Bill Gates and Mark Zurkrbuirg when you keep going you will see the results so keep pushing and one day I guarantee you will be a great role model or even better. Just remember always keep that positive attuide and keep trying think about the good and not bad and you will have the key to success.

learning from your mistakes is another key attuide to have, people have to understand that when you learn its OK to fail and get back up from it thats why you learn from them for a reason. Having positive attitude in life helps you grow as person to understand, and in the long run it will important. When doing so, you will just keep growing,and having good support from yourself or others. think about businesses to be in a business its all about that positive attuide and character that's what makes you learn from your mistakes and to keep growing. In a business there's a lot of up's and down's with negative attuide it will only make it worst but when your in the right state of mind there are choices to make that you might not like but it is part of life,in a business you need to support one another.

In conclusion having a positive attitude is the key success in life, without it how will you know what you've accomplished along the way. There are many ways to have a key to success but the most important one is having positive attitude. And this will benefit your life even more,attitude is energy and showing off the wrong kind of energy will be consequences and will not get anyone anywhere in life. This is very important for each an other it's not very hard to be positive you just have to be in the right state of mind. This shows how much attitude can really change things it shows how important this is. I believe positive attuide is the key to success because it motivates a person to do good or better, spreads positvity to others who really need it,and makes you learn from your mistake because no one is perfect.

F9DDE725DB74,"To begin with, it is good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early?. In point of view, it is good idea because when students finish their high school in three years, they also can work, and save money to enter college. So it's good for students graduate in three years and obtain their diploma, and start to apply in some college. Also, students can find better jobs with their diploma.

First, it is good idea for students graduate and obtain their diploma because some students need the diploma to enter college. For example, my friend Generic_Name needed her diploma and start to apply in summer to enter at the

Hampton University. Furthermore, students who's want to achieve their diploma in three yaers, they have to work hard. But some students wants to achieve their goals without make any kind of effort.

Second, students can find better jobs with their diploma because if you don't have any diploma you cannot work in a proffessional job where people pay more. For example, my sister Generic_Name have to work after she graduate from from high school, but she need a good job to save money to enter one year later at college and pay her first semester. Instead, some students have to work because they don't have any type of help from their families.

If students have to work is because they want to enter college.

Third, some students cannot finish their high becuase they have to work for maintain themself. For example, my cousin Generic_Name cannot finish his studies because he have to work at 3:00 pm to 10:00 pm so he don't have time to his asignments of high school. Some students can't graduate not because they don't want to, cause they have to pay bills from their homes. Also, they don't have a better job to pay their studies from college and its harder to them to obtain the diploma from high school.

In conclusion, it is good idea for students finish their high school in three years and enter to college. So it's good for students graduate in three years and obtain their diploma. So students can find better jobs with their diploma and pay their studies from college. But, students can't graduate not because they don't want to, cause they have to work and pay bills from their homes. Also, when students have a positive main they can achieve whethever they want, it doesn't matter the situation that you live you can finish your high school and enter college if you work hard.

FA078892658B,"It is true that keeping teenagers out of trouble is important for many reasons. If regulations that require teenagers to be off the streets after 10 pm are adopted then they will help teenagers academically, socially, medically and economically.

The first reasons that proves that these curfews will help teenagers and keep them out of trouble is that if teenagers are not allowed to be on the streets in the middle of the night , then they will get more sleep and will learn more efficiently when they are school. For example, if a teenager is not allowed to be on the street during the middle of the night, then that individual will get a good night of sleep and will be able to stay awake during classes. Also, if this regulations are are adopted, then they will require teenagers to stay at home longer, which will help them because they will have more time to work on their homework and if they do their homework then they will improve their grades. Furthermore, these curfews will help teenagers improve their learning skills and will also help them rest more and get their grades up.

The second reason that shows why these curfews must be adopted is the one that will allow teenagers to socialize better. For example, if teenagers are in the streets in the middle of the night, then people will not want to be close to them because they might think that they are bad people and that they are probably involved in gangs, so they will be scared of them. Many people will agree that it is better if teenagers stay at their houses during night hours because if they stay at their homes doing good things, then they will make more friend, socialize and communicate better with people because no one will be afraid of them and no one will think that they are involved in some criminal group. So, if teenagers keep themselves out of the street during the night, then they will be able to make friends, communicate better and basically socialize in a better way in which no one will try to avoid them.

The third reason that proves that these curfews must be adopted is the medical reason. If teenagers are in the streets during the night, then they have the possibility of getting in fight and ending up with injuries. For example if a teenager is out during late night hours, then others might think that he or she is there because he's a bad person and then they might get into a fight in which someone could get hurt and end up in the hospital. These curfews will prevent teenagers from getting into fights and from having to go to the hospital when they can just stay at home and be safe.

The last reason that will keep teenagers out of trouble and will help them is the economic reason. For example, if a teenager wants to be out in the middle of the night, then that individual can find himself or herself a job that will allow him or her to work during night hours, keep him or her out of the streets and help him or her economically. Economically means that the person will be working, earning money and also staying out of his or her house during late night hours. Teenagers can improve themselves economically if they spend their time working instead of spending it in the street doing things that will not help them in anyway. Finally, by working and improving their economy teenagers will be able to save some money for their own future and have money available for emergencies that can occur throughout their lives.

Furthermore, it is better that these curfews are adopted for the security of teenagers. Also because these regulations will help teens improve themselves economically by keeping them out of the streets and motivating them to find a job if they want to be out of their house during late night hours, they will also help them socially because people will not be avoiding them if they are not seen in the street, medically because they will prevent them from getting into fights and having to go to the hospital and finally academically because teenagers will not be wasting time on the streets and they will have more time to do their homework and improve their grades at school.

FA08CD5A2E48,"Sometimes when you are not doing anything or just do not do something physical, some good or great things could happen surrounding you and the world.

My first idea that makes inactivity a ""self work"" in progress. Meaing letting people around help you instead of you doing everything yourself. A movie called ""Christopher Robin"" shows that as a child, Christopher did things before but he had imaginary animals helping him.

The purpose of the movie, is to give the auidience the understanding of what it means to be always doing something, always occupy yourself with the simplest things that you do not really have to do. And adding pressure on yourself. Than letting others help you, can create good things surrounding you and you can have good thoughts. Because when you are stressed you are worried about how things will be in the future. Having people help you can still have great success that can be accomplished.

The example or message in this movie shows when Christopher is an adult and he pre-occupys himself a lot, the more problems is caused with his life. He almost lost his wife and daughter because he was always occupied doing his business job. Later when he realizes he was on the wrong track, his friend, pooh was telling him he is not the same as himself before. He told himself the only way he'll be less stressed and worried is to become the child inside him and bloom once more. Letting your inside child out, he needs to find himself doing absolutely nothing, no stress, and just spend time with the life he has been given and his family. After doing that, he was more gifted than before, like this idea he had for how to make his business better but had never presented because he was always doing something

Like the thesis was talking about not doing something physical could lead to some good or great things, Christopher found himself at the end. He is happy and relaxed with what he accomplished when he let go and did nothing. Now he realizes the result of doing nothing and how different it would have been if he kept on occupying himself in things he should not be worried about rather than enjoying what he has to thank for. So the key is that if Christopher Robin can accomplish great or good things by doing nothing rather than doing something, then that means everybody else can learn as well the understanding to find success and move ahead.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0

FA55AEEF8F9C,"Alot of people use cell phones In classrooms which I think It's a good Idea. Cellphones are use for emergencies and educational purposes. In my opinion students sometimes are given alot of work, where they have to find Information on their textbooks, or dictionary that takes almost half of the class. when they can just look it up on their phone and take about 10 to 15 minutes. Another thing is to think about are that students sometimes forget their homeworks at home and is worth half of your grade. and by having their phones with them, they can called their parents and asked them to drop up their homework at school. cellphones should be allowed in classrooms, students would be less stressed about school. They won't have to worry about carrying a heavy textbook, when they can just do their work on their cellphones. which it means, more work done and less time wasted on going page to page looking for the right answers.

Now let's talk about having a cell phone In classrooms In case of an emergnecy. One reason I believed they should allowed cellphones In classrooms because In case of a lockdown. If a student sees the person, but the police does not know how he looks like or has no idea where his at. the student can call 911 and give details of the suspect. In addition to my other reason, Students should be allowed to have their cellphone In case of an emergency call. what If something happens at home. For example, A students sibbling gets sick and doesn't stop crying until he sees one of his family. So the babysitter calls his parents, but his parents can't do anything because they can't leave work or they'll get fired. The parents would have to call the student, now the student have to leave school and take care of his sibbling.

In conclusion, I see no reason why students shouldn't be allowed to use cellphones In classrooms. schools would be more easier and safetier. you may never know what could happen and a cellphone can be a huge impact. It can save someone's life. so I think student's should be allowed to have cellphones In classrooms. sometimes students read a whole book and they dont understand it so they stop doing their work. while you can use your phone and find all the things and learn instead of reading a whole book and find most of the things you were looking for but not learning at all.

My first reason is because good behavior is the best way to influence people because if you are a smart person, educated , and happy your are going to be a example for other people and they might said that they want to be like you. Many teenagers has ruin their life for following bad influences. People can said that we are old enough to know what is good or wrong but we never think from what is coming. The world is full of bad person and some people would ask their self, why there's too many bad people in this world? the answer is because people is influencing others to do bad stuffs. If human wants a better world for their kids they have to be good influences, good examples to the new generation that is coming.

In my own experience I have seen friends and relatives that has ruin their life for getting together with people that is a bad influence for them. Is really sad when you see somebody that is in jail or dead for following bad examples by having bad friends. When you are following a bad example that person never is going to tell you what are the consequences. As you can see babies when they are in the age of learning new things they do what their parents do or what they teach them to do. Adults and teenagers are a little bit different because not all the time we do what people tell us to do, but we always end up learning something of that person.

People is always criticizing so if you don't want to that happen be a good example. Being a good influence people would trust in you, but being the opposite of that nobody would trust in you. And when we realize is too late because the people you appreciate are separating from you for been a bad influence for others or maybe for them. My grandma always said , "" what you crop, you would sow."" For me those phrases mean a lot because being a good example or having a good behavior will take you to succeed in life , and is not just that there are many ways to succeed in life too.

For these reasons I believe that a good example is the best way to influence others so the people that is learning or looking what you do can learn good things about you and by that wat can trust in you. Also you will feel proud of yourself that your are influencing other in a right way. If you want a better world be a good example for others and don't lose your time in influencing other in a bad way.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0
FB4D3D883D49,"Cellphones has already taken place of your calendar don't let him take place of your family. Some people think cell phones should be allowed in school but other says it is just destruction. Cell phones shouldn't be allowed in school because it is destruction,increase cheating, and less use of dictionary.

Firstly, cell phone is destruction. For example the one person I know was always on her phone. Moreover as her phone vibrate she just open the phone and start checking messages. As result she was not distracting herself but also class and teacher. Later on due to this habit she couldn't pass SOL.Because phone was destruction for her. Last year one of my friend didn,t uses much phone in the first quarter she got really good grade. Furthermore in second quarter she starting using cell phones more. Moreover in school she do all her work in rush so that she could have more time for cell phones. As a result her grade starting getting worst she ended up felling her both SOL.In her first quarter she has six A and one B but in fourth quarter she have five A,one B ,and one D.Furthermore one of person couldn't pass SOL and grades also go really worst.

Secondly,cell phones is not only destruction but also increases cheating. For example one of my friend whenever give test she take picture and send question to other student. The teacher make same test for both classes. Furthermore she can help them by giving them answers in test but in SOL

she couldn't help them. As a result they will end up might be felling SOL.Moreover one of person was giving a final exam in school she was also texting one of her friend all the answers and the answers she didn't know she was also using Google for them. Most of the question was about vocabulary she was just searching vocabulary and writing on final exam. Cell phones are not only increasing cheating but also student thinks they are helping others which is wrong. The both person was doing wrong one of them was sending question to her friends other was searching from Google.

Thirdly,cell phones is destruction,moreover increase cheating furthermore there is less use of dictionary. For example one of my friend prefer searching from phone rather than using dictionary. The main reason for using cellphones instead of dictionary was because from dictionary you have to find a word it take more time than cell phones. Furthermore in cell phones you just have to type a word and cell phones will give you meaning ,and synonyms. Moreover one of my friend always uses phone for searching a word meaning she never use paper dictionary but in SOL they didn't allow you to use phone. As a result she struggle using paper dictionary. People want easy way to do things that is why they uses cell phones instead of using dictionary.

In conclusion, some people think cell phones are helpful in education but other thinks it is destruction. Cell phones are not helpful in education because it is destruction for students,increase cheating,and less use of dictionary .Students are keep checking on their phone. Cell phones is also increasing cheating student text test question to each other also can search from Google. Cell phones are also taking away people paper dictionary from student , student really struggle when they go for testing and cell phones are not allowed. Cell phones are like drugs to youth they are getting addictive to it.                               ",3.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5
FB6F9B24FD1B,"I think that students should commit to their career at a young age because it will move them and encourage them to go further into being someone that people can rely on, and its a big help to society and the community and it will help it a lot because theirs generations that had some kid that turn into an adult did their part in that generation and the after that and after that, and some things change in the peoples mind once they get older and wiser and that is the big picture. Also some students might change that career because they want the best for them selves and its not bad to change who you want to be in the future because no one is choosing this for them, they are the one thats doing this for the best of them so when they want to make money love what they do to get money with passion they are living the life of a normal money making person and it doesn't matter how much money your making its STILL MONEY!!!! and some people around the world still don't get that. Soon they will want to go to college and thats big step into having their career because theres more studying to it and the teachers aren't as nice as you think they are and they will be very comfortable with you goofing off in class, after that your out of the game, also it a lot of money to pay yearly for their tuition and depending if your were born poor, rich, some what rich or wealthy enough to pay then your fine to stay in their to study party relax and play video games with the boys and eat a lot too if your close to a restaurant, cafe, buffet or a diner then go ahead and fill up that empty stomach. After that when they have a good time their and read to graduate they'll go to a University, and I gotta tell ya it not the same as college, it more studying and more work and if you can handle that pressure with no sweat then your set for a nice year in there, but depending how long your going to stay there, it can 1,2,3 or 4 years when you think you have enough knowledge about your career and studies then your set to get a job that pays you well and have a happy life. Now that we got that out of the way, we need to talk about how the students are going to be effected by by all that has happened to them and how far got to that end point of their journey to be successful in life and be some people he or she can help one another so they make that persons life better and make them feel happy, the students need to be happy with how they are working because if they don't they can have stress and anxiety and soon they don't want to work any more and we can't have that in our generation, so we have to let them be someone that they want to be before some one else will!. Before all that, about all I said about the colleges and universities, their Parents, oh yeah the big dogs the ones who have created you to be a good person with a good career their child/student get older, the students have to tell their parents what they want to be when they grow up to be an adult, yes I know that they always say that when you were a little kid, but your still a kid but a teenager from the age 13-17, your still going to be told that and you have pursue your dream or goal of being someone that goes without saying, so this is why students should identity their careers by the time they enter high school.",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5

Because when ever kids are using kahoot they work together to get the right answers,kids enjoy using kahoot to learn better then using paper and books because kids get really bored of using paper and books,Paper and books are also boring for teachers to grade too. But , Kahoot keeps the kids more active when they are learning and gives the teacher better controll of the kids. Also,kahoot is easy to teach with because when kids use paper and books the teacher has to go to the kids one by one just to correct their mistakes but when the teachers are using kahoot they can explain the right answer faster and better in front of the whole class.

FE14D7378CFB,"Do you agree or disagree about imagination being more important than knowledge ? I believe its important to get peoples opinions on this question because i think Albert Einstein would be curious about what people think.

Once they have chose what they chose they could talk about it, give each other some details, also communicate with another, ask questions on to why they chose what they chose.

I disagree wit Albert Einstein because imagination is something you imagine in your head or dreams it can be real only sometimes. I agree with knowledge because it happens in real life and when you do something you have the knowledge to know it right away. Students use their knowledge in school to learn about English.

In school i use my knowledge by reading books and by reading i can understand what the book is talking about and i will know how i will write a short summary of the book. My second detail is i can use my knowledge in soccer because i can learn new skills and read a book all about soccer and i can understand that i can use my knowledge by knowing what reading is. Imagination wouldnt be more important than knowledge because the things that you will imagine probably wont come to real life. Imagination isnt a smart way to use the word important because it wont really help students, maybe even adults. Knowledge i know that its a smart way to say important because it does help students in school, sports, maybe even with some decisions they will make in life.

Albert Einstein probably asked us to agree or disagree with him because he wants to know what are thoughts are and would want students, adults, teachers to communicate with each other and talk about why they agreed or disagreed with him.

FE7408E48786,"Students get their longest break on summer when they finish the first ten months of the school year; however, they will forget the information they have been taught in school when they get back in fall if they spend this long vaccation for only partying, going for a trip, or without taking classes online. Also those people who argue that there should be a year round schools and summer should be a 3-4 weaks break, it will be a less time break for most students who have planned to do their own projects while reading and without forgeting what they have learned.

First, when students complete thier school year and started planning what to do for thier summer vaccation, spcially teens will put partying on the first list. There are some students who are doing worse than this, doing nothing but waiting for their friend's party. Students don't realize that they are wasting thier time on partying untile the coming scholl year approaches. This doesn't just waste their time on thier vaccation when they can take classes online or school closer to where they live in but they are wasting thier money instead of saving it for their college tutition.

Second, when someone goes for a trip, they will observe information and learn from what they have seen when travelling. On the other hand, when students are going for a trip, most of them will be taking pictures of themselves only without paying attention, observing ideas, or learning from what they see on the trip. If they were paying attention when travelling without just taking pictures of themselves, they were going to get benefitted for some classes like history and geography.

Third, in the summer long vacation if students are not going to summer schools or studying at home, they definetly should be taking online courses to help them not to retain information as easily when they return to school on fall. When students are not studying ortaking classes over the summer, their brain is not developing which makes them not to be a creative or open minded. Plus, it is hard for most students who was enjoying summer without taking classes and getting back to school when it opens to understand like other students who have taken summer schools in their long vacation.

In conclusion, I don't agree with the idea that there should be year round schools to prevent students from not retaining information when they return to new school year from their summer vacation. Instead of creating a year round schools, students can enroll themselves to summer school and study with their parents support. Additionally, if there is a longer winter break in the middle of the schools year, students most likely will forget what they have been taught before even finishing the full school year. Furthermore, long summer vacation is helpful to complete what one student has planned. As the matter of fact, even if there is a 3-4 week break in the summer, students will still not retain information easily when school starts if they don't use their vacation time wisely on purpose.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5

It is true that a positive attitude is a key to success in life, if you have a goal and you really work hard to achieve it , you are always thinking ""I can do it"" and you are being positive about it, you have the idea that you will get whatever you want to get.

In addition there are many people who really want to get something or get to somewhere, but their minds are always thinking negative, they feel like they will not do good or they will not success, it makes them not keep trying. For example, when I was in middle school I had a classmate who will always think he was a ""looser"" he will always said that he could not do anything, his parents did not love him, so many horrible things that will make feel sad, I always tried to make him feel better by saying positive things about him, but I thing that is all about the ideas we put in our minds.

Success depends on our actions too,sometimes we let other people decide for us, we either do what they said or we act the same way they act. Some of this people do not have a positive attitude to help you success. we create a plan that we have to work on to be successful, even though that we need to have a positive attitude. We have to make it happen no matter what, try as hard as you can! because if you just have a positive attitude but you are not trying hard an off, is not worth it, I seemed some people that are very good at something because thats all and the only thing they do :However they don't try to keep going further, and when they are in a situation that things are more challenging they give up!

A lesson i would teach to elementary students is about being active in life and why its's important to be active in life and it's,doing sports or or a physical activity, eating healthy, and going to the gym.

Doing a sport is very important, because you are getting the excercise you need and loosing weight. It is very important sports if your a child, because children are young and energetic, so it is good for them to run around. Kids don't have to do sports, they can just go ride a bike around the neighborhood, go for a daily jog, and go ride a skateboard. This could be there daily exercise or weekly excersie.

Eating healthy is very important, because you won't have a high chance of getting diabetes or heart diesease. Kids should eat there vegtables too, because it won't make you gain alot of weight. In my opinion I think vegtables are better than fruits. Children need to stay away from sugar, salt, and greasy food, because if you consume those types of foods it causes high blood presure, which gives you headaches. This could benefit for the rest of their lives.

KIds should go to the gym once in a while, because they can go on a tredmill for 10 minutes. Kids should lift dumbells also, becuase it gets them stronger, and they could lift them at any size. Box jumps are perfect for leg strength, and it helps you with your athlecticism and vertical. The gym is perfect for a exercise routine.

First, imagination can make yourself happier. Why? It is because you can imagine something that you like. For example, you want to fly like a bird but you can't do that. You can imagine how that feel. It feels free? Comfortable? Or tired? You can also imagine how you look like when you were 100 years old. Imagination make yourself happy.

Second, how can imagination help people? Let's think about if there is a child crying in the mall and everyone look at her because she dress so weird. You can use your imagination at this moment. You may told her to imagine with you. For example,""Don't crying sweetie, think about everyone look at you is because you dress like a princess. Now you are visiting them. You have to be nice and elegant. "" Maybe she will stop crying.

Lastly,parents always said "" You can't find a nice job that you want by having your imagination."" I think you can find a job with your imagination. For example, if you want to be a home designer but you don't have imagination. You make the house so horrible. You will got fired and you can't earn money. On the other hand, if you want to be writer and you can imagine lots of things and create 30 or more excellent books. You can earn lot of money even earn more that a doctor. So, I think Imagination can find a really nice job that you want.

FEDCB06D743F,"Dear Generic_Name,

It has come to my attention that schools have partnerships with companies that allow students to explore certain occupations trough interships and shadowing opportunities, to discover whether they are interested in pursuing that type of job. However I'm in favor of the new opportunities that the schools are offering to young teenagers.

Allowing students to explore certain ocupations would motivate students to decide what type of job they want to dedicate their life on.

Every student dreams to have a perfect job, were they can have a good enviorenment and do what they love to do, But for many other reasons; students do not have the same opportunities as other's. with the new chances that companies are offering to students, everyone has the choice to be what they want and be succesful in life.

Every student goes trough a hard process were they have to decide, what they want to become in life. as a result not everyone gets the job they wanted to, causing that this person feels miserable working in a place were they don't feel comfortable. many juniors and seniors are feeling the pressure deciding what type of job they want; However companies allowing students to discover what their passion is and what type of job they want to get,would increase the percentage of students achieving their goals and get the job they wanted to.

Not every student has the chance to get the job they want to. either way because they don't have the sources to reach their goals or they can't because they are not well stablish financially. for example, my dream is to become a doctor but no one of my family have gone to collage, they don't have any expierence nor the sources to help achive my dream. I believe i'm not the only one that is going trough this, schools partenerships with companies benefits everyone in many differente ways, causing that every student has the chance to succed in life.

Lastly, allowing students to have the will to explore new opportunities benefit those who are still deciding what they want to become in life, and those who don't have any chance on achieving their goals. it's very important that every teenager prepares to the real world, without having any doubts or risking themselves to be unsuccesful. companies allowing students to choose what they want to be in life can be one of the many reasons that our future can be secure.

FF6224AC70C6,"A city council is having arguments to adopt curfew for teenagers,10 P.M on weekdays and midnight curfew on weekends. Some people thinks this to be a good idea,but others especially like young people does not think so. There are conflicting opinions over this topic. According to me this is a good idea to set a limit for teenagers who stay away from home late night. In my opinion,this adoption can lead to improvement in sleeping habits of teenagers,prevents unhealthy food habits and allow teens to spend more time with their families.

Curfews to stop teenagers going out of home late night make them improve their sleep time. As they are home they sleep on better time than they are out till midnight. For young people sleep time should be 7-8 hours atleast,because of their growing body structure. Young people are more energetic if they sleep well. Staying out late disturbs bed time for teens,which makes them lazy,tired and inactive in activities going on around us. Unadequate sleep can also lead to risk in driving a vehicle. As you could not sleep well you may feel dizziness while driving a vehicle,which is really dangerous. A lot of teens die in road crashes because of unattentiveness while driving,this unattentiveness comes from unadequate sleep. Also the crashes are caused due to drink and drive habits after staying out late night. To protect teens from death in that early age curfews should be adopted. As when me myself could not sleep well,I am unable to concentrate on my work in my class. This alot of times effects my grades. Also when I stay awake till late night separates me from what is going on in real world because when people around me are awake,I am not focused and asleep.

This adoption also somehow effects teens eating habits. Staying out means eating unhealthy and junk food,which is not at all good for young people's health. Along with adequate sleep we also should be healthy to stay fresh and active. It is really necessary for young people to eat healthy food because they have their full life to live and if they will stay unhealthy,they will get diseases in really early age. Not only food when teens go out with friends they drink alcohol or beer, which is not good for them at that early age. Unhealthy food weakens teens immune system which leads to diseases in quite early ages. Not only diseases unhealthy food collects a lot of fat in their body that effects teens socially,mentally and physically. If teens stay in the house they eat food provided to them by their parents, also which is healthy and not too oily. Whenever I eat unhealthy food it makes me sick and if you are in place where no one knows you,people there likes tyo stay away from me which makes me feel uncomfortable. I have seen a guy in my family who have grown fat after eating a lot of junk food,he suffers a lot of problems like he need someones help to get up if he sits down,a lot of people teases him for his fatty body and also he cannot even walk fast because he gets tired fast. So to stay away from these bad comments and unfit body teens should eat healthy food and home made food.

Apart from food and sleep curfew for teenagers make them stay home with their families. This makes them to interact with their families instead of going out with friends. Most of times generation gap is being shown in between families that is just because of less attraction in between people in the families. Having dinner together at night makes you discuss various aspects going on around us. Like when our family get together we talk about of new things we tried,just as me and my sister made new friends as we shifted here this year. Also we talk about how to be aware from diseases going on in recent days. We also discuss about problem we are suffering from. This makes us share our happiness and problems we are going through in our life and also we are able to intract wih the family members.

There are various more ideas that shows that this adoption takes teens lives towards positive aspects. Proper sleep,healthy food and interaction with their families can be obtained if this curfews are adopted. To make future generation healthy and concentrated about development and growth of our country these laws are need to be applied. If teens will be healthy they will come up as fresh and present minded citizens towards the country. If they will sleep well,they will work hard to make their dreams come true. Also if they will interact with their families they will make each and every one satisfied in world. Teens should take this in a positive way instead of taking it as a restriction on their freedom. This is not a reastriction but a key to live healthy,fresh and active way of life. Give teens life by restricting their habits instead of giving them dealth with improper lifestyle.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5
FF7FE6BD8509,"I agree that first impression is almost impossible to change. No matter what you always want to stand out of the crowd and show the best of you. People are always going to think of you of how you first were when they met you.

The first impression isn't just about you acting in a certain way. Its also about you showing them your character but most important to get them thinking good things about you. I have three examples of why first impression is important. My first example is that Generic_Name want's his parent's to meet his girlfriend. He thinks thats her first impression of how she acts or on how she greets her self toward's them is something his parents are going to be looking at. Most Guys like Generic_Name want their girlfriend to have a good first impression so their parents like her. Then second example is on the first day of school teacher's always want to give their student's a good first impression about them. Either on how they teach or how smart and fun they are or anything so the students like them. Last but not least my third example is when a school goes on a field trip to a museum or to another school. They want to have a good first impression on any other school that's there or anyone one because, you're representing your school.

There are people who believe that first impression by a person dosen't always show how they really are. For example when you're on a date and you might be dressed in a way or talking with a different type of slang. But that dosent trully demonstrate that if the first time you guys went on a date. That on the second date you can give a better impression than you did the first date. You cant always judge someone by their appreance or on how they are. Another example is that if you're best friend thinks that you want to be with the prettiest girl in school you might want to step it up and change the way you are. You can change the way you are and the first time you meet her you were rude but you're best friend thinks she will like you if your sweet and friendly. Not everyone thinks the first impression is hard to change.

However,I still believe that the first impression is the most important no matter what the situation is. I also still believe that the first impression is hard to change. Some people are different then others they don't all believe the same thing but in my case it's hard to change how people see you the first time because,after that they are going to always look back at that and remember how you were. You always want people to think he best of you because,there going to be a situation that if they need someone they are going to look for you.

To the people that think first impression arn't important they really are. You always want to show people the best of you no matter what. It dosen't matter who you're with or where you are it's always about showing the best about you so people can always look back see that you stand out in between so many people they will look at you. For example If your getting a job and you have a job interview at a certain time; You either might want to be there earlier then the time they gave you or on time. You have to impress the boss or the person interviewing you and blow their mind and why you would be a good person to be hired for that position.             ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
FF9E0379CD98,"Some school offer distence learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by way of line or video conferencing.

I think is not benefit for student, that take classes online because in the video maybeabilities ,and dont have a teacher is not organized dont have partner when are you take the classes online.

Teacher: when are you take the video online you dont have a teacher for tell you what do you need do in the class ,and him cant help in your work for example the teacher cant help with kahoot or quizlet or with others strategies of work .

Organized: when you take the class online you dont have organized, if you need highlights or pensil for write something for read it or explain your work.

Partners: in the class you dont have partners or others people with you, just are with your teacher online, but is not your confidence or your friend like in the school the many people is your frends However; the people can say you cant take the class online because you work for ten hours for this you need to take the class online, but is not bad idea take the class, but you cant work or cant study after school with partner.

Conclusion: you dont are prepared for take the class online worst is a video coferencing because you dont have teacher, organized ,and partners in the end you cant take the class because is more difficult for learn in your work. is more better take the class in the school you have more benefit how you can pass the class and more oportunities that the school have for you ,and in the school you can help new students ,and in the school you can protrude like better student in the school. Also there are alternative of take class online becuase ther are benefit.",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5
FFA6690BC309,"Having activities after school are good ideas for students so they would spend the time doing good things and not thinking in make bad decisions and we do not need more bad people in this world we need more good people to succes in this world. Although some people think that schools should control the students involvement in extracurricular activities nevertheless, the students should decide if the student wants to do extra activities after school because students would have the freedom to decide and some students needs that time to study or to work.

First, students need to have the freedom to decide if they want to do actives after school for example some students work after school sometimes they need that time to make money to help their parents to pay bills like rent or water. If the students have activities after school they would not be able to help their parents. Also some students need to take care of their family members like their brothers, sister or cousins. If the students do not help to take care of their family members their parents would have to pay somebody else and that would mean spend more money for them. The students who work are also learning more skills so in the future they would not be lazy and they are learning how an adult life is that is not to easy but they would be lucky because they would have learned that when they were younger. Also sometimes parents decide for the students to do an activity that they not even like which it means that the students would not be happy and they would have a lot of stress is better that if they want to do an activities they should decide what they want to do not be a parents decision.

Second, students need this time after school to do homework or to study. For example if the students have activities after school they would be late at home and they would be tired which it means that they would not study or do their homework so they would get bad grades and if they try to do their schools homework they would stay up late which it means that they would not get enough of sleep so they would be sleeping and lazy at class the next day. Also students need this time to take a break from the school and relax students school's life if hard sometimes they need a break from everything to came back with more energies. Having enough time to study would help the students to improve their skills at school so in the future they would have more opportunities to find a good job that they would enjoy and they make money to have a decent life and support when they have a family.

This shows that students should decide if they want to do extra activities after school because students can have the freedom to decide and the if the students have activities after school they would not have time to study or to do their homework. In my conclusion the life of a student is not easy they need to know how to manage their time so they can go to work or study sometimes they also have things to do at their house taking care of their family members. Students needs to choose if they have extra energy to do activities after school. Students would have a lot of time in the summer vacations so they can decide if they want to do and activities they would know how to manage their time to work and take care of their families member but they would be also enjoying their time doing activities.
